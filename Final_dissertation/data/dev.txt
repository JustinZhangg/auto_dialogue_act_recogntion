{F Oh, } my God.	21
{C and, } -	26
Yeah.	15
{C and then, } [ we're, + we're ] having one on the way [ in, + {F uh, } in, ] {F uh, } September.	24
Yeah.	36
I don't know if it's a government run or if it's a private -- -- charity that's put it together.	24
{C and } a really hate the Redskins. {C And } a lot of it's because, {D you know, } I got a lot of people, {D you know, } at work with and everything that are big Redskin fans.	24
{D You know, } we're so fast paced here,	9
I see.	15
She was a little perturbed about it.	24
it seems like, {F uh, } maybe more of them come  in with good intentions,	9
{C And } that was so nice.	24
<Laughter> That is out for me.	24
# Right.	36
Yeah,	36
{C And } [ I kn-, + I know ] that there are some parents that say how do I get my kids in that,	24
Uh-huh.	15
All right.	13
It must be the marketing pressures,	9
Right.	15
[ I, + I ] think that's a possibility, -	9
Uh-huh.	15
{E I mean, } I found that my kids had no conception what college was really like -- -- [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] that the  process of going around to a few schools with them really helped them understand --	24
{D Well, } we had that happen once, {F um, }	24
((yeah)).	26
It's something like, {F um, } A JOURNEY [ IN, +  IN ] YOUR INNER, CHILD or something like that.	24
{C and } that way it gets above, {F um, } other cars on the road --	24
{C And, } {F uh, } you have to have  it, {F uh, } fairly early in the summer or it is too hot up there.	24
{C And } I thought that was interesting.	9
[ I didn't, + I didn't ] even really think about it that much, {E I mean, } {D you know, }	24
I, -	26
No,	33
{D Well, } it's real pretty up there.	24
{C and then } the judge says, {F oh, } no,	24
Uh-huh.	15
# <laughter> they don't have to submit to drug testing [ like, + like ]  they do here in the States and some places abroad.	24
{C and } the roses just seem to survive just fine there.	24
Yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
Right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } in the meantime, the school still has lots and lots of kids in it.	24
Yeah.	15
I'm not sure.	19
Yeah. #	15
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah.	15
<noise> Was that our beep?	7
{C and } what you do to make it, you take the shell and you spread the beans on first,	24
Yes.	36
Yeah.	15
In public places.	2
Absolutely.	36
if you're trying to do something, even with food drives -	24
No,	33
it, {D well, } -	26
Yeah.	15
in fact all our earlier cars were a standard transmission.	24
I think it's a wonderful product.	9
Uh-huh.	15
yeah,	26
he, {F um, } had her in the car in front of a Taco  ((   )) or something --	24
I forgot to ask you, did the iguana catch flies for you?	7
My wife isn't working	24
{C and } he just put a big old cast on it.	24
That's neat.	21
# {D Well, } the # Saturns you can get air bags in them.	24
{C and then, } {F uh, } [ that was, +   {F uh, } {D you know, } that was ] her choice pretty much where she wanted to go --	24
{C But } [ we, really, + {E I mean, } really and truly  we ] just don't have a quarterback,	9
I like those type of shows.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Did you base it  on what you wanted to major in or what you would feel comfortable with  or what you could afford	7
Yeah.	15
{D Like } [ this, + this ] friend of mine's pretty obnoxious	24
{C so } it doesn't matter.	24
last year it was the end of July	24
# all # right.	29
{F Oh, } that's really too bad,	21
# Uh-huh,	15
{C and } he was  (( on the lawns ))  from the time he was in the seventh grade  and, {F uh, } a small  ((   ))  and all the way through college	24
Yeah,	36
<Laughter>.	20
Right.	36
# {C And, }  {F uh } # -- -- the infant needs her # desperately, # at that point and time.	9
<Breathing> {D Well, } second grade it was, -	26
Exactly,	36
{F Uh, } # [ {C and } <laughter> # -- + -- {C and, } ]  {F uh } -- -	26
Right.	15
I just, <noise> -	26
{C So } all we had to sit here [ and, + and ] ask is {D well, } what aren't they telling us, {D you know. }	16
Right.	15
{C So } [ he, + they ] can have time with him [ an. + ]	24
Yeah,	4
# Uh-huh,	15
Uh-huh.	15
I remember reading in the paper a few months back	24
You want <<mispronounced>> to, {F uh, } [ e-, + explore ] a new field	22
Uh-huh.	36
[ I don't think I've ever, +  I think I've, ] -	26
Yeah.	15
{C But, }  {F uh, } that new stadium's going to be  real nice,	24
even now in America, {D you know, }  we wouldn't know the truth with all of Indian groups that were totally removed from  the face of the earth, because of how wicked they were.	9
I can't remember, {D you know, } a day that I walked out and the wind wasn't blowing.	24
{E I mean } I think sometimes some of [ the, + the ] women's lib though, is kind of like they wanted it all, {D you know, }	9
{D So } -- -	26
{C and } it was about seven inches of snow on the ground.	11
It's just, -	26
{C and } -- -- the truth that's brought out is, {F uh, } as I say,  when I've heard about, {D you know, } -	24
{C but } # -- -	26
{C but, } {D you know, } in Texas, it's next to free because [ th-, + they ] pay so much of it.	24
{F Oh, } my word.	21
Uh-huh.	15
# {F Oh, } okay. #	29
And the hand eye coordination	9
{E I mean, }  they'd [ ra-, +  much rather ] go in the store and buy something than be spanked.	9
No income tax and no sales tax.	24
{C but } on the other hand [ it's, + it's ] fairly impressive to watch them, {D you know, } walk into the room with gallows.	24
Yeah.	15
Oh.	15
{C So, } {D you know, } those early ages [ when + [ he would, + ] {D you know, } when ] his mom and  dad are at work, # and # he's actually in child care in a preschool not, # just # child care, # {D you # know, } we could have sent him to anybody, # {D you # know, }	24
{C And } they were all shooting state of the art Soviet weapons.	24
{C And } this is it,	13
yeah,	36
The starters are kind of fragile.	24
Yeah.	15
I have to think every year to try to remember [ what it was, + what's it supposed ] to like this time of year.	24
that's exactly what I was going to ask you.	24
That's rather interesting.	21
She was making {D like, }  {A I don't know what she was making, }  forty-five dollars a month I think.	24
{F Oh, } {C and } do you buy one every two years?	7
{F Huh. }	26
[ that's + # that's ] a little bit extreme.	9
My mother likes to serve taco grandes.	24
{C but } last year I just figured they was under a lot of pressure because of  all the publicity and everything,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Oh.	15
unfortunately.	21
I think you've put your  finger on the one benefit [ that I, + that I ] would most like to see, {F uh, }  changed <throat_clearing>.  {F Uh, } the, {F uh, } parental leave.	24
# Wait,	18
They, {F uh, } randomly select employee numbers	24
Are you going to do that?	7
Uh-huh.	15
Yes.	36
{C and } she always told me it was because  I was still growing	24
I've been called,	24
-- just regular water.	24
{F Oh, } it's very difficult	36
[ that's, + that's  ] a good idea.	21
Right.	15
{C or, } -	26
<breathing>	20
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah	15
{C But } there's, -	26
{C and } I feel, -	24
when I was teaching school I saw [ many, + so many ] kids that were at loose ends and that didn't really have a purpose.	24
{C But } I don't have that experience,	24
with the mind set of the American public, I think what they will do is start paying Mexico -- -- to take our trash.    *[[slash error]] [ That isn't, + that isn't  ] harmful.   *[[sv]]	9
{D Well, } part of that is the overcrowding of the court system.	24
We end up paying for it again.	9
{D well, } thanks so much.	42
Yes.	36
We've got, {D like, } an eighty-four Charger that's about gone and [ a, + {F uh, } an ] eighty-nine Horizon.	24
Yeah.	4
Yeah.	36
{F Oh, } how nice.	21
{E I mean } we've got beautiful places to go.	24
Yeah,	36
# I told them if they don't # vote they don't have the right to criticize.	24
{C So, } <baby>. -	26
{C but } Dallas doesn't pay.	24
my bo-, -	26
[ I, + <throat_clearing> I ] kind of think that, {F uh, } {D you know, } some of our friends or even our own children will be in a situation where they may need to look for child care.	24
{D Well, } what do you do on a cruise?	39
I really do enjoy his.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
-kay, Dave.	13
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh } really.	12
{C so } he grew up {D like } in the late fifties	24
Do you really not?	12
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah <<faint>>.	15
What division are you all in?	39
No.	36
Let me ask you.  Do you think the Soviet Union is a, still a threat to the United States?	13
They live  (( lean ))  for one thing	24
{F Oh. }	15
{F Uh, } I think I'd like to get, {F uh, } B M W [ or + ] if I go the German route, which I'm kind of leaning towards right now, [ but, + ] {F uh, } or maybe [ a, Hon-, + {E I mean, } [ a, + a ] Acura Legend. ] {F Uh } --	24
no,	33
[ I, + it ] was supposed to be this  June,	24
<Laughter> True.	36
Yeah,	15
Yeah	15
{D Well, } they got a three year lead time.	24
{C So } you h-, -	26
definitely.	36
{C and } the lady was very nice.	24
You know what I # mean? #	7
{C So } there's nine years of that man's life gone.	24
{D you know } we were on the scene with our team players	24
-- {C and } it zaps it.	24
# Oh.  #	15
Uh-huh,	15
Yeah,	36
I believe it's, {F uh, } at the discretion of the judge or jury.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Makes you feel a lot better.	9
Bye-bye.	38
# That's nothing, # {F huh. }	2
{F Oh, } okay.	29
Uh-huh.	15
{D See } I know of that too.	24
{E I mean, } # I think # that's the world today.	9
{C and then } [ some of it is, + some of it actually gets ] into some serious discussions of problems [ in our, + in -- -- urban society. ]	9
but m-, you know, -	26
<Laughter> {E I mean } you can go to K-Mart and  buy them for, {F uh, } eight dollars  or I think -- -- six dollars or whatever for toilet seats,	24
{D Well, } where are you?	39
{D Now, } my kids didn't like it because they just wanted to get plain old spaghetti -- -- <Throat_clearing> or lasagna,	24
Yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
government tool control is my specialty now.	24
Like for example, [ the Kennedy, + the Kennedy ] rape case.	24
{C And } {C so } this is what [ trigger-, + ultimately triggered  ] us, {F uh, } United States, {F uh, } per se, [ being, +  {F uh, } deciding ] to get out of the role of world policeman.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
"a young lady was killed sometime back, a young girl. A personal trial and the reporter was asking a [ stup-, + ]  stupid question of the people outside.   *[[ Shouldn't the continued statement end after ""A personal trial"" and a new slash unit begin? ]]"	24
[ {C but } -- + -- {C but } ] [ it was, + it was ] actually legal.	24
Now.	10
{E I mean } -- -- a lot of people do it really the reverse -- -- and go to work after the children -- -- are in school, {D you know. }	9
Right.	15
Yeah.	15
I do.	24
{C but } # {E I mean, } [ it's like, + it's like ]  [ they, + they ] have just {D like } different policy.	24
Yeah.	15
that's another thing	24
I remember at Christmas [ the, + the ] only thing that I'm, -	24
{C and } [ he baked us, + he made ] a real big cake himself,	24
{F Oh } goodness.	21
{C and, }  {D you know, } I'm a good hunter	24
Uh-huh.	15
She spends lots of money on them.	24
<Breathing> {F Uh, } I don't right off.	38
yeah,	36
# {C And, }  # {F uh, } I had to struggle with that for a while to figure which belt goes where.	24
Yeah.	15
[ I, +  I ] agree with it.	24
{C but } that wasn't it.	24
I really don't miss all the heat there.	24
It, -	26
Okay.	15
I know they lost, {D yeah, } to Washington and  Philadelphia.	24
{C but, }  of course it's hard when you don't have any family around.	9
You see it for, {F uh, } {D you know } a couple of hours or an hour	24
{C And } it can be pretty sad.	9
{C And } it has improved the personality.	24
Right,	15
No.	33
{F Oh, } my goodness.	21
{C and then } also, we had done some camping in Colorado, in the mountains,	24
I have not seen as many of hers.	24
{C but } [ I don't, + {F uh, } I don't, ] {F uh, } subscribe to cable -- -- [ be-, + because ] of the poor service and also, {F uh, } because, -	24
{D Well, } that sounds pretty good.	21
{F Um, } I don't really <breathing> think that it's, {F uh, } too many,	9
One was about painting.	24
Uh-huh <<pause>>.	36
# {C And } allows, # -	26
About music?	14
{C Because }  I personally don't like the combination rooms.	24
{C And, } {D you know, } we're supposed to be,  {A and I quote, }  in a democratic society.	24
# Yeah,	15
is it Chicago and, -	7
{C and } they  ((   )) -	26
{C So } we could {D like } play hide and go seek in our house and even stuff like that.	24
Yeah,	15
{F Oh, } okay,	29
It's hard.	36
Yeah. #	26
[ I've, + I'm ]  sure I watched it for more than that probably.	24
Uh-huh.	15
<Laughter>.	20
that's right,	36
{C and, } {F uh, } just, it's kind of a shame that [ [ I'm, +  I'm go-, ] +  I'm ]  away from it now.	24
Uh-huh,	15
really <laughter>.	36
for as far as, {F um, }  I would think [  the, + probably the, ] {F uh, } worst substance that's probably, {F um, } -	9
other than my children have gotten. -	24
{C And, } {F uh, } somebody suggested to get a bass.	24
[ {C So, } + {C but } ] I've been at it for, {D you know, } five years,	24
{F Uh, } yeah,	4
In fact, {F uh, } [ we even, + we were ]  at the farmers market yesterday and bought a few tomato plants and things like that,	24
{C so } it's been good for our family.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
{C so } <laughter>  that part of it would probably work out <static>  <noise>.	24
I've never done that.	24
Uh-huh.	4
<<Baby crying>>.	20
<Throat_clearing>.	20
{C so } you don't have to,  {D you know, } unless you're just really sick,  or the child's sick.	9
yeah,	15
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } that's good,	21
# Bye-bye. #	38
Uh-huh	15
Yeah,	4
[ I, + I ] just have a scroll saw and a  jig  saw	24
Right <throat_clearing>.	15
{C and } the price is as reasonable as renting a video.	9
yeah,	26
I'm sorry.	41
[ I, + I ] am my only  b-, -	26
# Right.  #	15
{C and then } they go off and do other things during the summer.	24
Yeah.	15
<Laughter>.	20
{D well, } wonder if that <laughter>, -	26
{C and } I've always appreciated when she's sat with them.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	36
I don't either.	24
Uh-huh.	15
we had a lovely little house over there,	24
{D You know, } it's like, -	26
# {D Well } # -- -- I particularly have a problem with the illegal immigration.	24
the lines in there were just  perfect.	24
and getting rid of old cars, like I said is one way to help correct the problem.	9
I wouldn't want a Lab.	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ [ D-, + do  they, ] + do they ] play up the local crime angles	7
{F uh, } {F uh, } a friend of mine goes golfing a lot	24
it really is,	36
[ we're, + we're ] all for it.	24
[ Just, + just ] the aluminum pop cans.	24
{C and, } {D you know, } the girlfriends just taking off for a day <laughter> or something. Just getting in trouble and probably not that much trouble	24
there's, {F uh, } a lot of extremes on the parties, too, with  [ the + {D you know, } the  ] real, {F uh, } far side of the Democrats	24
{C and } they've got, -	26
{F Um. }	26
It broke the limbs.	24
yeah.	36
{F Huh. }	26
{C and } I would put it in the sink	24
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ]  {F uh, } [ I, +  I ] also think we  extend too much help to other, {F uh, } countries	9
Anyway, we both sort of agree on it, don't we -- -- about random testing.	7
{C And } it's real pretty.	24
<laughter>.	20
<Laughter> {F Uh, }	26
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh,	15
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } {D well, } that's not bad.	21
{F Oh, } I guess the stuff <baby_crying>  that was done more in the seventies,  because [ that's, +   *[[slash error]] {D Well, } {D no } that's ] really when  I grew up,	24
Yeah.	15
I just remember when it first came out that it had kind of mixed reviews.	24
It's a pleasure talking with you.	38
Yeah.	15
{D well, } that's not the right way to  say it.	17
{D Well, } that, -	26
{C but } they, tell you that,	24
You had to have the help, didn't you?	7
{D Well, } we also in this area seem to have a lot of retirees -- -- people who don't want the heat of Florida but don't want [ the  heat of  the, + the cold of the ] northeast	24
{F Oh, } yeah,	15
and they, they do some pretty good news.	24
That's sure ri-,	26
{C but }  that has a little bit to do with some of the things that I read  <throat_clearing>.	24
{D You know, } they seem to have a really bad time with keyboard players.	24
The question is, {D you know, } can he be the  man who's ultimately responsible.	24
[ they, + we ] call it, {F um, } -	26
# {C And, } # -	26
Uh-huh.	15
[ {C And, } + {C and so } ] we haven't had to look for child care either which has been very nice.	24
Yeah.	15
{F Ooh, } yeah.	21
-- {C and } some people call them May beetles.	24
{F Um, } I really think that [ [ the, +  the, ] +  the ]  jury ought to have more say so in the selection or in the determination of whether  they are guilty or not.	9
Yeah.	15
Yes.	36
{C and so } I do have a band  saw and a router and,  {F uh, } things like that out in the garage.	24
Okay.	13
I do that at the end of the day,	24
{C and } we've been here years when it's been hundreds	24
Yeah.	15
{F Uh } <lipsmack>, {E I mean, } to me, in Plano you would think  that would be [ about, +  {D you know, } about ] as innocent as you  could get [ for + <breathing>, for ] being in [ a, + a ] large <breathing> area.	9
-- {C and } [ [ it's, + it's a, ] + {F uh, } it's a ] brand new one.	24
The inside where they're normally attached to, {D like } behind the door. -	24
{C And } it will send out a flower spike.	24
I don't watch much T V,	24
{C but, } {F uh, } -	26
I [ 'm, +  live ] in Plano, Texas	24
{C and } just the social values, -	24
I suppose [ the whole country, + {E or } the whole, {F um, } new state ] would require such aid.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } their test  came back positive,	24
[ we painted, + we painted  ] the whole inside	24
# Yeah. #	15
{C and  then } it lets them decide if that's what they enjoy doing.	9
{D well, } even if they're not enjoyable, they bring you [ a, + ] {F uh, } some kind [ of, + of ] learning,	9
-- if it's not comfortable, forget it.	9
Made it, -	26
-- {C but } for as out here, just anything that the moms, -	24
I-, {D you know, } -	26
{C and } during the summer we camp, {F uh, } two or three weeks a year <laughter>.	24
{D like } a carbon fuel of some sort,	24
Uh-huh.	15
it just seems the United States does  not provide for either  child care [ or geriat-, + or elder ] care, as I call it.	9
[ That's a, + that's [ a, + a ] ] tough one.	9
{F Uh, } guy was [ in a, + {F uh, } in a ] hunting club --	24
Yeah,	15
{F Uh, }	26
[ we, + we ] feel [ like + ] [ that, + that ] we can make it on one income	9
the  first one. -	26
# Uh-huh. #	15
It was good talking to you.	38
he's written some children's books as well	24
Thank you.	38
Uh-huh.	15
That might be it.	9
{C so }  it's not like, we're, {F uh, } # kind # of secluded, {D you know, }	24
Yeah.	15
it's nice talking to you, too.	38
{C and } I couldn't  imagine not having that thing on a disk -- -- where I could go back in and move stuff around and  change it.	24
-- {C but } we just haven't really seen them advertised or -- -- {D you know, } something.	24
{C So, } I'm just  a little bit different than typical, {F uh, }	9
Yeah,	4
{F Um. }	26
Do you?	12
Yeah,	36
{C But, } it just was [ so [ time, + time, ] # involved, + # {D you know, } so much time involved ] <noise> and the different steps and things.	24
{C So, } {F um, } home day care has been an option.	24
{C and } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] think my strategy [ if, + if ] I may, [ [ [ i-, + i-, ] + is to, ] + is to ] not spend money.	24
I think that, {D you know, } [ we, + we've ] resolved the issue	9
{C So, }  that way I didn't think, [ {D y-, + # you  # know, } ] the house would be, {D [ y-, + you know, ] } cleaned or anything for me specifically.	24
[ {C But, } +  {C but } ] [ [ the, + the, ] + the ] chances are not great that that will happen.	9
Right.	15
I do crochet and a lot of, {F uh, } things like that,	24
Yeah.	15
<Inhaling> {C So } [ that, + that ] option sometimes is not available if they do not have [ the, + ]  {F uh, } <noise> either Medicare or insurance to cover it.	24
{C and } I can't get the light off,	25
That's the only thing,	24
[ Not -- + -- it's not ] a network station.	8
yeah.	26
they're out doing stuff by that time.	22
Yeah,	38
(( Really is ))  <<faint>>.	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C but. } -	26
[ {C so, } + {C so } ] that's kind of like a double assault there.	9
I think the desert has a rare kind of beauty which, {F uh, } a lot of people don't realize,	24
in their own community,	15
{D Well, } that, -	26
{C but } I always  ((   ))   just made it a point, {D you know, } to spend about ten minutes with each one of them.	24
I just  laugh	24
yep.	36
# {C And } [ I, + I ] # just came from Saint Paul. {F Uh, } interviewing with Three M.	24
Okay,  Deanna,  {F uh, }	13
how come you wouldn't take them to a day-care?	39
# {C But } on the # other hand,  I guess it's all about choice <laughter>  -- -- in everything.	9
Yeah.	36
I go to L S U.	24
{C and, } {F um, } [ I, + I ] enjoy the socialization of it, {D you know, }	24
{D Well, } out here in Utah, five is about [ the + -- -- the ] average,	24
{C so } there's no problem.	24
{C but } she liked [ to, + to ] get in the pool on the first step.	24
Right.	15
<Laughter> I don't believe  (( that we're )) , -	13
because clothes [ are s-, + are really ] expensive. {D You know, }	9
{D You know, } maybe it's life in prisonment or,  {D you know, } something,	9
Right.	15
Putting the right people in the office, that's a lot to do with it too.	9
kidnapping, {F um, } {D you know, }  when they, -	26
That was before  I started school	24
That is a very good point.	21
{C But, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
[ {C And, } + {C but, } ] even when Bradshaw was playing, [ I, + I ] don't know, [ I, + I ] didn't particularly care for him,	24
I like a lot, {D like, }	24
Uh-huh.	15
I'm not certain either,	24
Yes.	15
We really have, -	9
{C and } it's pretty goo-, -	24
{C and } [ I really can't, + I really [ don-, + {D you know, } don't, ] ] # want to spend the money for it. #	24
# I # don't know if they've used it [ since then + since ] they've reinstated it	24
{C But } I'm not interested in having any car payments,	24
-- {C and } I don't think that we have gotten there yet.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Did you, -	26
Twelve and sixteen.	30
Yes.	15
I know the rain bring out the snakes or used to bring them out in the Ozarks,	24
# {C But } [ isn't that # , + isn't that ]  kind of   a blanket racist kind of  thing to say the blacks and Hispanics and other minorities just don't vote?	7
{D like } maybe Wednesday night it's George's turn to set all the tables.	24
I think this must be into my third week too.	24
Oh.	15
Not that I know of.	5
<laughter>.	20
{C but } the difference thirty and  thirty-five degrees is, quite a bit.	24
[ right + ] I think [ they, + there  ] needs to be a little bit more in the area [ of, + of, ] {F uh, } [ ad-, + advertisement, ] # and # [  letting, + public letting ] you understand, # more # of what it is you're doing, why you're doing it, how [ you're + ] it's done and, # [ what, + what ] # happens to it because I think [ that's, + that ] would help a lot.	9
{F Oh, } Uh-huh.	15
Arlington, Texas.	24
right.	15
they mixed, {F uh, } a gallon of it	24
{C but. }  {C And then }  she was like, {D well, } what do you do with the glass?	24
I think that's the title, by Marion Burroughs --	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C so } I try to have things cooked for her	24
Yeah.	15
{C And } I'm not sure [ that, +  that ] that's the reason why [ we're, +  {D like } we were ]  in Vietnam supposedly so.	9
Yeah.	38
I have a friend who has a minivan.	24
{C And } I think maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous,  {D you know, } {D like } millions and millions of dollars <laughter>.	9
{F Uh. }	26
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	36
Is it a single story?	7
they, -	26
You must really keep up.	9
the traffic. -	26
Yeah	15
{D You know } if they've been convicted and given an appeal and they're still convicted [  of, +  of  ] a crime that's deserving [ of, + of ] a lethal injection, let's do it and  not waste so many years to do it.	9
{C at } it's worst I think we've got the best.	9
[ I, + I ] hope [ you're, + you're ] a person who does things better than, -	8
{C and then } I missed once.	24
{C but } it doesn't do anything for them.	24
{C and } there's always going to be, {D you know, }  somebody having a need for a math or  science teacher.	9
I was drug tested, {F uh, } not for the job I have now, but for the prior job, {F uh, }	24
It didn't stay there,	24
I don't remember seeing one in the, uh, in the diagram --	24
Yeah,	36
yeah,	4
Good.	21
only I got kicked out as, {F uh, } the last  selection <siren> that the, {F uh, } defense got.	24
{D You know, } the, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } people think, {F oh, } we're in the nineties, we're beyond all that,  {D you know } <laughter>.	9
in other words, # there're more people, #	22
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
I -	26
Um.	15
{D You know, } I kind of see this as kind of a retirement community, as I always call it.	24
Yep.	15
Uh-huh.	15
overall I'm satisfied with it.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } [ she just, + her term just  ] ended	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
I use it occasionally	24
{F Uh, } [ I, + {F uh, } my father ] pays for [ [ my, + my schooling, ] + my tuition. ]	24
<Laughter> Whoa <laughter>.	21
what do you think is the biggest problem?	39
Uh-huh,	15
<Sneezing>.	20
I know,	21
Don't you find that interesting? {F Uh, } [ [ that they, + that ] + <laughter> that they're ] doing that, {F uh, } in any field,	7
Uh-huh.	15
{C so } I drove on those brake pads for, {F uh, } {D you know, } forty-five thousand miles	24
-- {C and } he speaks very broken English.	24
{C but } -- -- for me, when I think about social change, that's what I first think of	24
do you?	12
Uh-huh.	15
{D you know, } not, -	26
{C And, } {F uh, } not, -	26
# I don't either.	24
No.	33
didn't have to pay any income tax.	24
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh,	15
I didn't realize that Dallas had that same problem.	8
especially Columbia, is so built [ [ on the, + on t-,  ] + on the  ] drugs, that, {F uh, } [ our, + our  ] little war on drugs has really been laughable.	9
{F Um, } yeah,	30
I was like, -	24
{D Well, } the topic today was gardening, and lawn care?	24
{C But, } {F uh, } I, {F uh, } fo-, -	26
# that's right <laughter>. #	36
{C And } I think, {D you know, } around here, it's all ready   quit playing.	24
{D Well, } I painted the outside of my house -- -- and one bathroom.	24
{C So } you have a probably a more pitched roof than is typical around here.	8
Huh.	15
<Laughter>.	20
I'm not sure if they had one yet,	34
{C so. } -	26
{C So } we're going  to get a chain saw and limb it extensively so it gets the trees up overhead,	24
No,	36
It was very, {F um, } -	26
Do you put all the uh-huhs in here on everything, too.	7
{F Oh } really.	12
{C and, } {F um, } I was because [ my, + my ] same doctor, {D you know, } agreed to be in it for, {F uh, } -	24
Yeah	15
Cou-, -	26
some people I know also try to use it as float -- -- where they buy something now	24
{F Um, } [ I, + I ] don't know all the actors or anything,	24
# Didn't # -- -- have to, -	26
{C And so } they kept picking at him, picking [ at his, + at her ] mother and, {F uh, } finally, {F uh, } started picking on her. And getting her to, {D you know, } -	24
Okay,	15
That's all Mexico, I think.	22
<Cough>.	20
[ U-, + uh-huh. ]	15
They have to for international trade.	22
[ at, + at ] the T I there,  I said is there any area I should avoid.	24
{C and } I'd have to go in the other	9
{C But } there's not many of those available right now --	9
{F Oh, } I see,	29
Yeah.	15
I know New York also has a sales tax on clothes --	24
that phone is ringing to an empty desk	24
Houston.	24
I guess [ that's  alwa-, + that's been ]  the big role of government, I guess <laughter>.   # {E I mean } generally. #	9
and I still feel like they came out knowing just as much as I did.	9
{C so } that would make you really, tend to worry about them <laughter>, {D you know, }   if they're not right there	9
{C So } you never know [ what, + what ] may occur,	9
{E I mean, } I just didn't know.	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ They, + you ] become, <laughter> put on something like a sucker list	9
{D Well, } maybe there are some professionals out there <laughter>.	24
<Laughter> Yeah,	15
{C but, } {F uh, }  {D you know, } [ I, + I ] think of, -	26
{C and } that's a terrible paper. #	21
Roast marshmallows.	24
Okay.	13
{F Oh } yeah	15
# Oh.  #	15
I've been in it for [ twelve years, since  nineteen, +  {F uh, } {D actually } thirteen  years,  since nineteen ] seventy-eight	24
{C and, so } that really cuts  into your backyard space,	24
I used to, {F uh, } live in the Ozarks and, {F uh } -- -- liked to go up there and just take a backpack and -- -- strike out into the woods.	24
Packs away nice and small	9
(( yeah	26
Yeah.	15
{C So, } you see, like in a newspaper, they typeset.	24
No,	15
<laughter> Yeah,	4
# {C and } he's, {D you # know, } got a second grade reading level and a fourth grade math level.	24
{C So, } [ I, + I ] had the advantage of having a mom at home that nowadays [ kids, + it's a luxury item for mothers to be home with their kids. ]	9
Yeah.	4
{C but } something happened to the camera and the tape and -- -	24
It's -	26
{C And } I couldn't believe when I walked in  the door on my first day and here's the audit department of [ this, + this ] huge holding company,  sharing a H P Rugged Writer <laughter>.	24
{C but } neither of them wound up going over, which, I think they were very happy for.	24
{C but } they couldn't put everybody up.	24
that's, -	26
How about yourself?	31
About how many calls have you made on this system?	39
I wanted to be just like her, because she is so cute.	24
[ {C and } + {C but } ] I was awarded the car	24
<<pause>> I thi-, -	26
<Laughter> {C But, } {F uh, } {C so } [ [ it, + it, ] + it ]  varies,	24
{C And } he seems to do that sometimes <laughter>.	9
# Yeah. #	15
{C but } {D you know } you have these, -	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D well, } first, they always  say, get to know your country first before you leave, #	9
[ I, + I ] find the news reporting in the MORNING NEWS to be better,	24
[ [ {C and then, } +   {F uh, } {C and then } ] +  [ you, +  {C and then } you ] ] pass it on.	9
it's asking about what kind of steps we can take, {F um, } {F uh, } {D you know, } just as citizens to try and, {F um, } {F uh, } protect ourselves.	24
To you too,	38
Uh-huh.	15
# It's been a while since they've, {F uh, } # gone through the Barbie stuff #  ((   )) . #	22
Yeah,	15
Yeah.	15
{C and, }  {F uh, } phone rings like crazy	24
<laughter>, yeah.	15
me too,	24
is that kind of music <laughter>,	24
I just found out I'm going to Denver Sunday night again.	24
That one looks so scary #  just, # from the previews.	9
{C and } it just threw him out of the whole running.	24
"[ It, + *[[this ""it"" needs separate slash mark because B.108 is an ""aa"" with A.107, not necesarily the original intended continuation of this utt]] It ] really is."	13
I think so,	11
I can't,	24
{F Uh, } pardon?	14
Anyway, {D well, } it was nice to talk to you.	38
Probably blue. {D Like } if it, {D you know, } was just an average, middle class car.	24
{F Oh, } uh-huh.	15
-- {C so } it was a combination of criminal and civil,	24
{C and, } {F uh, } it was of the people from there that said that.	24
we don't have that many bushes to put them on.	24
{C And } another quick dish if you like, {F um, } do you know what hoi sin sauce is,    *[[two utts?]]	24
we went there for our twenty-fifth wedding anniversary.	24
I think we just,  {D you know, } listen to, [ is + ] the fact that there are good solutions both inside and outside of nursing homes.	9
We've had wonderful, -	24
Me to.	38
I guess you can get work visas pretty easily, {F uh. }	9
That's right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
I think [ their, + their ] version of the good old boy network going that, -	9
you've done. -	13
{C But } the school system's afraid of getting sued -- -- and, {F um, } all sorts of lawsuits I'm sure because of things like that.	9
Yeah.	15
{C and } she devotes,	22
he gets up about five  [ and, + and  ] -- -- does [ his, + his ] deal,	24
Right.	11
# I # know a train went by,	24
Bye, bye.	38
I know it.	24
# [ I, + # I ] don't know what they say  about Chinese,	24
I think they'd come  here trying to find a new market for [ their, + their ] brand of crime.	9
It's real hard to rate something like that.	9
Uh-huh.	15
there's a crime.	9
{C and } they solved these problems,	9
Of course what I used to like  to do though is go snorkeling for scallops -- -- in some of the bays, [ or + {F uh, } or ] [ oy-, + for oysters. ]	24
{D You know, } people put bars on their windows in certain  neighborhoods	24
uh-huh.	36
Yeah.	15
I work at the T I site in Hunt Valley, Maryland.	24
<Laughter>  {D Well, } [ you have got, + You have got ] five months before you will see that <laughter>.	24
{C but, } Bermuda seems to be, -	26
At one point, one third of the population of Argentina was Italian. {D Like } pure Italians.	24
{D Well, } my degree is in teaching,	24
{F Um, } at the same time, I've seen, [ we, + we  ] have [ a, + an  ] international population.	9
[ Did, +  {F um, } do ]  you have a favorite hors d'oeuvre recipe that's easy	7
Yeah,	36
# Yeah.	15
{C but, } -	26
Yeah.	15
{C and } a couple of drug people got into a  fight with a gun	24
-- {C and so } I was going to school for, {D you know, } just a few hundred dollars a semester,	24
{E I mean, } it's time  [ to, +  to ] either, {D you know, } put out or shut up.	9
{E I mean }   at one point it's going to be too late to do it.  #  ((   )) . #	9
{C so. } -	26
Of course we have a slight problem in that, {F uh, } the number of the illiterate in America is mushrooming at this point,	24
Okay.	15
{C and } when she died [ it just, +  it just ] absolutely destroyed me.	24
{C so. } That would be a nice thing.	13
{C or } you don't like them.	38
Right <swallowing>.	36
Okay,	29
{F Oh, } {C and, }  of course  they can also cause injury to other people.	24
{C and } the men that drive the trucks -- -- [ with, + with ] the guys that fix the power lines aren't tested as much.	24
{C but } once it starts getting real hot -- -- then it just kills them cause they can't stand the hot weather.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
Right.	15
What do you call it?	39
Social changes.	30
Did you, -	26
{C and } they're charging me unreasonable  ((   )) interest,	24
{C And so } they suggested that I might  want a smaller school because I was used to a lot of one-on-one -- -- {F uh, } {E or } small group situations.	24
we get the daily, {F uh, } DALLAS MORNING NEWS	24
{C so, } {F um, } unless we want to keep [ paying, +  paying ] for these people that can't make it in society, we're going to have to do something.	9
No.	33
Uh-huh.	38
<<Very faint>> Uh-huh.	15
# Davis Iron Work,	11
{C But } I gather  you do not separate,  {F uh, } the bottles and cans.	22
That'd probably be pretty interesting.	22
that's true.	21
Huh-uh.	15
I even like classical music.	24
Noise.	9
{F Huh. }	19
Yeah,	36
<Sniffing> He stopped them for routine traffic violation	24
I just love sharing meals [ and, + and ] whatever you can do,  {D you know, } to do that.	24
{C but } it wasn't that easy  for her to just take off.	24
The next  subdivision over from me is total brick	24
# Right. #	36
But still, she'll just take them,	24
Yeah,	15
I don't either.	24
{C And so } a lot is wasted.	24
{F Uh, } God, I guess I haven't seen too many movies lately.	24
you really do use it throughout the year,  because you get your teeth fixed and all that,	9
No.	33
{C and } I say what are you going to do.	24
{F Oh, } that's nice.	21
Bye-bye.	38
Wow.	21
{F Um. }	26
{D Well } I think [ if, + if ] you had [ ha-, + ] a handgun though,  in other words it wasn't premeditated,  you had a handgun,  it's the middle of the night,  someone's down-, -	9
# <Laughter>.  #	20
How do you feel about, -	31
{C but, } -	26
{C and } you see, {D you know, } fourteen year old kids flaunting money, because the parents give them money to go down and play video games all night, {D you know } --	24
it doesn't say, <<very faint>> Gourmet Choices.	24
the fast food ones are probably the ones they like the best.	24
yeah,	15
Yeah,	15
{C and } he pitched for an exhibition game for the Rangers.	24
Yeah,	15
{F uh, } it is  just a job	24
{C but } mostly it was just because she kind of gave up.	24
# {C and so } # I want my -	24
I'm a graduate student.	24
# Yeah. #	15
# See there, # -	26
Wal-Mart,	30
Really?	12
{C And } one of the things [ that, +  that ] they did  for him. They tested him	24
{C or }  they're introducing some new product in the area	13
All right.	21
yeah,	4
{D Well, } he stays with me --	11
{C and, } -	26
Uh-huh #	4
Uh-huh.	15
{C So } you do quite a bit of traveling then.	22
yeah.	4
Right.	15
In fact, we had been in Dallas	24
{D Well, } those people aren't there anymore.	24
{C And } that, -	26
{F Uh, } {C but } {D anyway, } {F uh, } otherwise, I would imagine, {F uh, } good vacation [ is, + is ] important, although I don't know if that's really a deciding factor for many people on a job.	9
{C and } they will say Mom this is important to me,	24
-- {C and } [  it's, + it's ] like new --	24
{C and } it is a [ fairly, + fairly ] complicated process where you # have to go # -- --  pick up the ballot.	9
{D well, } getting back to the P C -s,	24
Interesting.	21
it's just so dreadfully expensive,	9
{C but } [ [ I still, + {E I mean, } I learned to read, ] + started learning to read ] when I was in kindergarten, {D you know. }	24
{C but } it was funny, {D you know, } -	24
Yeah,	4
{F Uh, } originally?	7
My grandfather is ninety-two years old.	24
# {F Uh, } #	26
<Tones>.	20
{C and } you just feed your cans slowly into the slot,	24
-- it's harder -- -- to come in there and do something.	9
{C because } I remember searching ditches for beer bottles because they were worth money --	24
Oh. # Yeah,	36
I told my husband last night when I had called and they had, told me that this was a topic,  I said, {D well, } I can tell them how to fish with a minnow or how to fish with a worm <laughter>.	24
Oh.	15
# {C so, } # we could, {D you know, } -	26
Uh-huh,	15
{F Uh, } I wish we did <laughter>.	24
{C so }  the engine never got put back together again.	24
{C and } so do I	24
{D you know, } [ that, + that's ] what's they're coming across as  (( is ))  some of the companies anyhow.	9
right.	15
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well } I picked it for a couple of reasons, it was only about an hour and ten minutes away from home, so it was far enough away that I was away, but yet close enough if I ever wanted to go home, I could.	5
{D You know. } [ [ In, + in, ] + instead, ] [ it's, + it's ] the taxes here	24
They closed shop, and said, {D well, } we can't put any more papers out,	24
That is beautiful where you are at.	38
Changes.	2
Not during the trial,	24
<Sniffing> These people that are  carriers and # [ don't # + -- -- that don't ] reveal it?	7
yeah,	15
<Buzz>.   *[[slash error]] <Buzz>.   *[[slash error]] # Right,   *[[slash error should be 'aa']]	20
I've never tried it.	24
[ if -- + -- if ] they don't know anybody and they don't know what's going on around them and everything like that, {D well, } I can see, maybe a nursing home would be better, {D you know. }	9
they can't talk about God.	24
{F Oh, } really.	12
that's important -- -- I would say.	21
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } it would be considered good because it's Madonna, {D you know. }	9
# Oh.  #	15
If your child is old enough, -	9
I have the same situation.	24
I worked in one as a teenager.	24
Did you have, {F uh, } your own business	7
have you heard of them?	7
I'd like to see that.	24
I took the clip out, or whatever	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
I've gotten all of them for gifts.	24
huh-uh.	33
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } apparently there must be work available, for those -- -- that are,	8
It's kind of a barn like structure.	24
Both,	11
{D So, } -	26
He is, {F uh, } an attorney and his daughter is an attorney	24
{C and } it, -	26
Yeah.	15
{C but, } {F uh, } they blow through here all in the Spring.	24
{C but } -- -- I find that very annoying <breathing>.   The, {F uh, } mail stuff,	24
I didn't think it was too long at all.	24
{C And, } {D now } that takes the strain [ out, + ] off of everyone that, {F uh, } is driving a vehicle,	24
{D You know, } [ {C and, } + {C and } ] it's, {F um, } -	26
<Laughter> {C and } she's expecting the end of this month,	24
{C and } they were having a little break,	24
--  ((   ))  part of the reason I'm participating in the project -- -- is to see how the stuff goes.	24
they're wonderful to work for.	24
That's what they're called --	9
I guess you have [ [ to + to, ] + {D you know, } to ] stay in the game I guess.	9
{C and, } [ if I, + {D you know, } if I ]  know the topic I'll go ahead and accept it as mine,	24
I didn't.	24
That's right.	21
-- they don't have enough money -- -- to keep it going,	24
I was talking to someone,	24
Yeah,	15
{C and } to prevent  that kind of misuse of power, they wrote into the Constitution a protection -- -- against judicial mishap.	24
{C And, }  {F uh, } sometimes it's nice to go out and have a salad.	24
it [ doesn't, +   doesn't ] pay.	24
Yes.	15
# Uh-huh. #	15
Yeah.	36
{F Uh, } {D you know, } I mean it was ready for the graveyard.	24
{D Well, } do you watch much T V?	7
Yeah,	36
No --	33
# Yeah. #	15
{D You know, } all these things.	24
<laughter> I cook dinner   <laughter>.	24
<Laughter>.	20
[ {C So, } +  {F uh, } {C so } ] that's a good thing.	24
I know many of us are thankful that he still has a -	24
{C And } it was, <<pause>> -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } somewhere in the back of her mind she had it that she would live with her children.	24
How about yours?	31
Do you like it at all?	7
{C but } to think that solely, alone is going to cause something like arteriosclerosis [ is, + is ] just hard to believe.	9
{D Well, } [ I, + I ] feel in light of some of the accidents and so forth that have happened lately, that I think there are some occupations [ that they should, + ] such as the health field, the transportation field, {F uh, } -	9
{F Oh, } there's -- -- too much to see really.	9
Really?	12
In fact the first year we were married,  he [ was already over there, +  had been there ] two years when we got married	24
[ I like the way that, +  I like the way that ]  idea of the south is,	24
right,	36
# I know [ they do do some, # +  they do have some ] classes in,  {F um, } high schools <lipsmack> and things for kids to, {F uh, } give them  an idea of what <<pause>> family life is like [ and the, + {F uh, } {D you know, }  and, {F uh, } that ] kind of thing	24
Yeah.	15
but, -	26
my husband is an only child too	24
[ I, + {F uh, } I ] don't think it's over.	9
kind of the forceful, {D you know, } -	9
# {E I mean } you knew it # --	24
I use mine a great deal, {F um, } for groceries,  for everything that I can and, then just write one check at the end of the month, # for the entire thing,	24
[ W-, + we ] were looking at those in a magazine.	24
{C and so } I thought {D hey, } I'll just try this, {D you know, } # and # see what it was like.	24
Uh-huh.	15
# Yeah, #	15
<Breathing> {D Well, } <breathing> right now we're just renting,	24
That just bothers me <laughter>	24
I have sold five of them, so far.	11
I know	21
{C and, } {F uh, } his business is going down the tubes so bad, {D you know. }	24
Do you think it's an economic [ c-, + necessity ]	7
Yeah.	36
{C So, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I've ] seen it the second time not too long ago.	24
[ I, + I ] can't, watch M T V anymore.	24
{C but } I thought, {F uh, } {D you know, } [ if these things, + if children ] are being abused, [ I, + I'm ] wondering how our school system is failing, that they're not even seeing this, {D you know, }	24
Right.	38
Uh-huh.	15
it's kind of both, I guess,	9
{C and } [ there's, + {F uh, } there's ]  some different things, {F uh, } one that you've already mentioned [ is, + is ] health insurance.	24
Uh-huh.	15
from what I can tell.  {E I mean, } I didn't talk to the guy or  anything,	24
{F Uh, } I like to watch FORTY-EIGHT HOURS.	24
{C So } yeah,	26
{C And } I think somebody told me it's also on a creek side lot, <children_talking> heavily wooded off the golf course.	24
#  # That's so good. #	21
Yeah,	15
and the other responsibilities are still important.	9
{C and so, } # -	26
BLUE SMOKE AND MIRRORS was the one in eighty-two.	24
{C and, } {F uh, } my  sister-in-law lives in Chicago,	24
# {C so, } # no,	33
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } Sheltie Collies are, {D you know, } timid,	9
{C and } I was like, Laura. # How # did you get all this stuff?	24
-- [ it, + it ] brings out [ such a, + ] so much different things [ in, + {F uh } -- -- in ] the string beans.	24
{F Oh, } I'm guilty of that sometimes	24
Right.	36
[ [ I have not, + I have  not, ] + {F uh, } {F uh, } there are not ] as many good shows [ that I, + that I ] continuously like to watch as much as I used to <inhaling>.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } the seasons are just so much different.	24
I think we would want one that, even though it was a compact car or  whatever that it would still be nice enough that, {F uh, } you could take someone in it and not be embarrassed <laughter>.	24
That, -	26
then those in turn got a hold of these other ones.	24
let's see, the more [ [ that we do, +  that we do ] +   {E or } that we can do ] to help them become self-sufficient  is going to eliminate more of the risk of that becoming, {F uh, } {D you know, }  a reality.	9
{C and } we're all there	24
{D Well, } vicarious learning is a wonderful thing.	9
I guess it's a task 'cause I can't make myself do it lately.	24
I don't know whether, {F uh, } -	19
they're coming up from Florida,	24
You go out and get in that real cold car --	9
# Bye, bye. #	38
That's good.	21
[ [ it's, +  it's a, ] +  it's a ] tremendous thing when you sit [ in  a, + in a ] college environment and  discuss some issues and really sit there with people with disagreeing opinions	9
I didn't grow up eating that much seafood	24
[ They've got, + if you go in the entrance,  they've got, ] {F uh, } stands usually where they have, {F um, } [ little, + {F uh, }  kind of a little ] newspaper thing -- -- that the kids can read	24
It was, {F um, } not that kind of H M O -s where you have to go to [ their, + their  ] sort of {D like } clinics,  {D you know } --	24
He took the less expensive one of course.	24
{C But, } {D you know, } for the most part, gardening for us is, -	24
Yeah	15
I just can't stand to even get out [ in the, +  {F uh, } in the ] dirt <laughter>.	24
{D like } [ I, + I ] know that, {D you know, } breakfast, [ we would, + {D you know, } we'd ] have these big breakfasts cooked over this little Coleman -- -- stove	24
{C So } you have to go to a lesser engineering school.	22
I'm scared to run, for dogs.	24
# Okay # --	15
{F Uh, } it really is better to give then to receive.	9
-- {C and } we make a two weeks tour [ of, + of, ] {F uh, } foreign countries	24
[ I guess, + I guess I can ] intellectually kind of come to grips with all of that.	9
you saw, statistics that lawyers and doctors make the most  money in the long run.	9
Yeah.	15
You just, -	26
Diesel is going to be around,  because it doesn't evaporate easily,	24
Okay,	9
{F Uh, } {C and } if the parents do not care enough to take an interest in whether the homework is done -- -- {D you know. }	9
It really is.	36
I don't blame people with today's society about going out to help themselves.	24
[ [ It, +  it, ] + it ] really works that way <laughter>.	9
{C and } it seems to be getting tougher as time goes by.	9
[ [ [ There's, + there, ] + th-, ] + this topic ] is kind of mute. # {F Uh } # --	9
{D Well. } -	26
{F um, } {C and, } [  I, + I ] think, I liked the other movies he's done.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
<Laughter>.	20
both, {E excuse me, } -	26
-- {C and } we live in a neighborhood  where there is not any little kids to bother me, since mine are all grown up,	24
{C or } do you get to stay home with them?	35
All righty.	13
That's a show I like.	24
They had the Disney -	24
{F Oh } really,	15
{F Uh, } {D well, } {F uh, } out of control, I don't know.	32
{C and } -- -- people there, -	26
# <Laughter> # This is really neat.	21
<lipsmack> {D Well } [ I + I ]  think we've covered the subject	9
How about you?	31
So many times, {E I mean, } you had [ the, + {F uh, } the ] coal miners and steel workers going out at the same time.	24
Uh-huh.	15
-- {C and } that's not necessarily fair.	9
Her mother-in-law had been  in for quite some time and had different degrees of a place that she was in.	24
Our lives [ are, +   are ] built around foods that we like   and, [ an-, + ] nutritionally good for us.	9
{F Uh, } {C and, } {F uh, } then he tried to made grapefruit citron one time.	24
I know	21
# Uh-huh. #	15
I think that that's probably true.	21
Yeah.	36
everybody died,	24
it's the same way with everything in  education though.	9
to a point,	9
as a matter of fact, I want to think they took the top managers first,	24
{E I mean, } he really tries to, brighten up your life.	24
[ One, + one ] guy won t-, -	24
Take care.	38
{C and so } -- -- they made me sit and wait for forty-five minutes, drink a whole ton of water -- -- before <laughter> I went to any of the interviews and go in there again, -	24
{C and } I feel like, the whole vocabulary of this is very loaded if you think of words [ like, + like ] put her in there.	9
Uh-huh.	15
[ I, + I ]  think that, {F uh, } -	26
# I am going # to make you sound like you're -- -- # eighty something.  #	9
Yeah,	10
In the last few years, I think,	24
{C And, } stuff like that.	24
{F Uh, } {D you know, } about a minute or so. And, {F uh, } very twisty stuff.	24
{C But } he's in a box, right?	7
{F Uh, }  {C and, } {D you know, } now we're, -	26
(( Rolly Polly ))  what?	14
{C And } you don't have an annual fee there,	24
-- because parents aren't parents.	9
{F Uh, } {D you know } yourself how many times have you heard where, {F uh, } {F uh, } a citizen was wrongfully arrested, # and served time # at a penitentiary, {F uh, }	24
Yeah.	15
I have a Master's degree	24
I guess I'm supposed to be all for switching to the metric system,	24
I don't know if T I has lost as much as everybody else,	19
Yeah,	15
{D Well, } I was called	11
He worked for United Telephone System,	24
{C and } [ it, + it ]  was [ a, +  a ] nominal charge that [ this, + ] {F uh, } it started out that the lady would come in  I think three times a week and  eventually got up to the point where they were coming by every day.	24
{C but } I didn't know if it's been my color choice or multiple moves -- -- [ or, + or ] what,	24
Yeah,	15
does  that stay pretty constant there	7
[ I, + I  ] don't, -	26
{F Oh, } {D man, } I imagine.	21
Right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
we get some killer winters up here in the mountains.	24
{C and }  [ we're, + we're ] kind of experimenting right now.	24
they are.	36
Yeah.	15
if I have a coupon we can go there	24
Uh-huh.	15
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah.	15
[ Of your, +  of your ] consumer credit.	24
I mean,  not -- -- not too often real bad ones,	24
# it doesn't have # <laughter>.	5
{C but } they weren't as interested in it as we were, {D you know, }	24
{C but, }   that doesn't negate that you do reap what you sow.	9
{C and, } {D you know, } usually when they call you, it's going to be [ when you s-, + right when you sit ] down to dinner because [ they know, + they pretty much know ] that you're at work all day	24
[ {C but, } +  {C and } ] they have children,	24
Huh.	15
Keeping fish, I guess -- -- is my biggest hobby.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
That's right <laughter>.	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C So, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] think that, [ [ he, + he, ] + he's ] actually, -	9
I don't know what she calls them in	24
Really.	12
<laughter> My Mother used to put that curse on my sister.	24
((   ))  work hard to get, {D you know. } -	24
They have a little curriculum.	24
{C And } my mother had a nursing degree and was able to make it in her profession,	24
{C And } where I live, [ it, +  it's ]  pretty scary, because Texas is one of those strange states where if you have a contractor  sign on your note like that -- -- and you screw up, you don't get  it finished,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } -- -	26
<laughter> okay.	15
# {C And } we try # -- -- to, -	24
{F uh, } most teachers after they have taught for a very long, especially at [ the, + the ] lower grades can spot a problem almost immediately.	9
During those first few months you have to think about running  and why your elbow hurts and -- -- why you can't breathe and this and that,	24
{F Oh } boy, to have a computer back then.	24
we have a one year old in the house	24
<Laughter>.	20
He was probably in the  cafeteria when he thought of it <laughter>.	9
{C Because } I teach history,	24
Wait.	18
Good morning, A R E, this is Arlene Lister <<answering another phone>> <noise>.	10
{F Uh, } I think it probably is more  likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody.	9
Yeah	15
# Exactly.  #	36
That might work in some places.	9
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C so } ] I just give her the money <laughter> -- -- and take her word for it <laughter>.	24
is that mostly, {F uh, } fly fishing when you're doing that	7
<Laughter> {D Well, } {F uh, } we always, -	24
{C but } it seems like there's only about four or five different ones,	24
Yeah.	15
-- {C but, } {F um, } there are still a lot of people who insist [ on, + on  ] driving their own automobiles -- -- {F uh, } to go everywhere.	24
-- it's not, a lot of the firms  that offer, -	24
Bless your heart.	21
Right.	11
{F Uh, } Maryland.	24
yeah,	36
{C and } some of those people, they don't deserve to be let loose.	9
{E I mean, }   I would think somebody would try to compete with that  because it is very popular,	9
That seems [ [ a, +  a, ] + like a ] cultural lapse.	9
If you had to do something like that, day after day.	9
{D Oh, } yeah.	36
{D Well, } that's great to know.	21
really,	12
I'm getting some of that.	24
I know	9
Uh-huh.	15
{D well, } {D see, }  that's another plus.	21
they had snacks and story time and everything.	24
I see.	21
Okay <laughter>.	13
[ I do    not, + I  do not ] know,	19
Right.	15
{C so. } -	26
{C so }  they, {F oh, } -	26
Which is funny because I got called last night -	24
{C and } she <laughter> had to get tested	24
my wife can't understand it,	24
{C and, } # the # next thing you know, your knees are wet.	24
[ [ you, + y-, ] +  everybody ] gets, {D you know, } five pounds of garbage that they can throw away, {D you know. }	25
[ I, + I ] love to cook.	24
{C And } I spend most of my time carpooling <laughter>.	24
it's a lot of fun.	24
Yeah.	36
Yeah.	15
I've, {F uh, } Had some health problems that have led me to, {F uh, } -	24
I know, {F uh-huh, } there are some oil companies,	24
<Laughter>  {D Well, } {D you know, } {D you know, } {D you know, } what's always good is sort of a  (( for savings )) , where they just take money out of you're pay.	9
{F Oh, } you don't like Howse, # {F huh? } #	7
{C And } the thing, [ we've, + we've ] neglected the value of voting.   # [ And + # -- -- {F uh, } and ] what it really means <clicking> to vote	9
They loved it.	24
gosh,	21
[ they, + they ] do have to check them off a list -- -- when they vote	24
{D well, } it's been nice talking to you,	38
{D Well, } {C and } [ you don't, + you don't ] see  the parents, {F uh, } encouraging those students to get on athletic teams or, drill teams or band,	9
yeah,	26
Yeah.	15
-- comparatively.	24
{C And } if they're out there buying that many cars, then there's that many out that are self sufficient and, {D you know, } mobile and working.	9
Unfortunately, there are a lot of people that just don't care	9
have you ever lived in a country where they use metric.	7
{C and } it's kind of, {F uh, } hard to get, {F uh, } shop space unless you have a dedicated shop or a dedicated room -- -- for that.	9
they don't get to see their grandkids,	24
We have more women in government.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Okay, {F uh, } I guess, we are just supposed to talk about things we do in our spare time.	24
{C but } I don't know at what point,	24
I think right now it's like sixty-nine,	24
# it has # a French name,	24
<Laughter>.	20
Right.	15
for the last couple of years I've done it myself.	24
Of course, I don't know how many of them were, {D you know, } not in their right mind. # or # how many were, -	24
I'll tell you what, [ I, + I ] can't say a whole lot about credit cards because I, {F uh, } tore mine up.	24
{D You know, } -	26
that's true.	36
You always learn something.	24
You probably wouldn't like my favorite team in college then.	9
<Talking>.	20
It was nice talking to you.	38
Yeah.	15
Probably.	36
I can't imagine what,  {F uh, } would have been wrong with this dog,	24
it's really, -	26
{F Oh, } I think that's great.	9
<music>.	20
my husband's sisters started it and sent it to us	24
[ {C and, } + {C but } ] she's a good paper pusher.	24
<Barking>  Uh-huh.	15
{C but } then fajitas are one of my, {F uh, } -	24
[ {C But, } + {C but } ]  maybe we'll prevent a few John Hinckley's.	9
{D well, } my favorite, probably, all time T V show is STAR TREK.	24
I've got a money market account that I do a lot of {F uh, } {F uh, } saving in	24
-- {C and } the radio is, {D you know, } more exciting, really, [ than, + than  ] television,	9
{C And then }  it was a matter of the selection of, {F uh, } twelve people after that.	24
Yeah,	36
Right,	15
{F Oh, } we never miss that,	24
[ I'm a, + I'm a ] musician	24
{C and } our next door neighbor was there,	24
{C but } it wears off.	24
{C So, }  {D anyway, } # {D well, } we all agree. #	9
Yeah,	15
<Breathing> <laughter>.  I'm not sure [ that, + that ] today's kids would go for it though.	9
{F uh, }	15
{C And } I'm just trying to determine,  {D you know, } [ how you address, + how you weigh, ] {D you know, } Rodney [ getting, + getting ]  the hell beat out of him against, {D you know, } forty deaths.	24
I think you're right.	36
{C So } is your grandmother, {F um, } impaired?	7
{D You know. } -	26
that was very good.	9
{C and, } {F uh, } {D like } when I'm at home since, -	24
{C And, } {F uh, } we had a restaurant  called La Bamba	24
You probably have some friends that have television <laughter>?	8
Right.	15
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] you were paying for really high quality care.	24
We save it for this trip, which is, {F uh, } always very, very nice.	24
{C but } [ the, + the ] way they behave. -	26
That's right.	36
Uh-huh.	15
-- {C and, }  {F uh, } it, -	26
I  ((   ))  exactly where she is.	24
{C And then } with our children, {F uh, } -	24
<sigh> one's in Iowa.	24
{C And } he only went a few months and then transferred to Pittsburgh.	24
Yeah.	4
I think {D well, } what if I were that one person and I was completely convinced [ [ [ that, + that,  ] + that,  ] + that  ] this person wasn't guilty, {D you know. }	24
{F Uh, } {F uh, } I like Tchaikovsky.	24
{C and } she looked very, very nice.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Um, } {F uh, } I'm in Dallas, Texas.	24
Okay,	29
How did you ever get into that?	39
I enjoyed talking to you.	38
{C and } that is sad, because, I think the health  profession is one of the most critical,	9
How about you?	31
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } we made the decision to put her in a nursing home.	24
{D Well, } -	26
{C and, } -	26
It is an incredible book.	9
{F uh, } {F oh, } I do,	26
{D Well, } I was appalled to read the other day about the, {F uh, } {F uh, } shooting on the tollway.	24
we had somebody do it	24
{C And so, } {E I mean, } it's been  ((   ))  dangerous for sometime.	24
don't need a closet <breathing>.	9
Do you live in the Dallas area?	7
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } [ I, + I ] tend to, {F uh, } take two kinds of vacations, the vacations to visit family -- -- and the vacations to just have a week being cultural and going to the theater and doing sight-seeing and things like that.	24
he had to, -	24
{C and, } {F uh, } I think it was called, {F uh, } {F uh, } White Cloud or White Mountain. And went up on it.	24
{F Uh, }  I know that there's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders.	24
I don't know if they still have them,	24
Yeah.	15
{C But } I'm not sure you have to go to outer space to achieve that zero gravity.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Good.	15
{E I mean } it's, unreal,	9
Yeah,	15
[ Some of them, + some of them ] moved back and forth,	24
[ They, +  they ] went to [ all, +  all ] ...  -	26
Yeah.	4
[ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C so } ] he  went in	24
# {C but } I haven't, # -	24
{C but } my last two children were, {F uh, } both entering high school age.	24
They had been to Disneyland,	24
You know that [ [ they, + they ] now have a, + {F uh, } I believe it's a ] federal law that you do not have to give your phone number on charge tickets.	24
I just, know I need to.	24
Okay.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Hello,	6
# Did you # say Romania -- -- or Armenia?	7
{C and } it goes into all the movies, previewing the movies -- -- that are going to be released or behind the scenes.	24
{F Oh, } you're kidding <laughter>.	12
{D Well, } I'll have to remember that,  because hopefully we won't have them this year,	24
Right.	15
{C But } we're -- -- paying for it.	9
I had pictures of her when she would sit on my hand	24
{C But } that's the second one [ of, +  of ] those that we've had,	24
{F Oh, } {D well, } how many people are you planning on serving at Christmas?	39
{C and } it went through the whole family and stuff.	24
right.	15
# {C And } I, # -	26
# {C and } our # economy seems to, -	9
Yeah.	36
I think [ it's, + it's, ] what they're basically trying to do, I don't know up here in Massachusetts anyhow, what they're basically trying to do is, {F uh, } {F oh } {D gosh, } {F uh, } any people who had [ di-, + ] tested positively, getting them into a drug program. Or rehab program.	24
<laughter>.  I've been fishing in [ the, + the ] ocean.	24
Okay.	13
I have boys,  {D you know, } {D like } eight and eleven	24
Right.	15
{D Well, } they might tell you it's random.	9
The president of General Motors probably has the same, -	9
I'm in Lubbock	24
{C and } it's so, {F uh, } -	26
Yeah,	15
Yeah,	15
Now I haven't seen I'LL # FLY AWAY yet. #	24
{C but } it could -	9
Where did you go to college?	39
Uh-huh.	15
{C But } I got off that.	24
{F uh, } there's no doubt about the fact that when I was first graduated from college the impression was that a woman's career would consist of a childbearing years and perhaps a return to the office, but not necessarily.	24
{C So, } yeah,	15
{C but } it sure seems nice to me.	9
Yeah.	15
I don't have an ethnic maid <laughter>.	24
{D You know, } that, -	26
{F Oh } boy, you do have a strange wiring problem there.	21
Uh-huh.	15
the trick is to get the cornstarch,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yes.	15
#  Just be-, # -	26
yeah.	26
{C So } that's a really stran-, -	9
Everything happened during the sixties,	24
# {C And, } {F uh, } # -	26
{C and, } his crop gets killed.	24
((   ))  I believe you should have the testing	9
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
yeah.	15
((   ))  it's just sliced tomatoes	24
it's kind of like the inside dual on a truck.	9
-- {C so } as the babies come out they fall down in the trough	24
we go out to dinner,	24
I just tear them off --	24
Uh-huh.	15
that's right.	36
{C and } the old dies	24
Yeah.	36
{C but } it's almost discretionary on the coach's part of each [ [ in-, + individu-, ] + individual ] institution to identify the ones that have the problem.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Do you know what I'm saying?	7
If we go out to a restaurant, {F oh, } just to float it,	24
{F Oh, } really.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and then } we still live with air pollution.	24
We're probably going to lose them	9
{C and } he is [ a, +  a ]  cutie	24
you take care.	38
Right.	15
Pretty cheap.	9
{F Uh, } someone gets picked up for drunk driving,	9
{C But, } I wonder about [ like, + like ] in Canada.	24
# Right. #	15
{D Well } I had heard that one of the comments # [ when they, + when they ] brought it, # -	24
{C but } it runs good.	9
I live in a pretty small apartment,	24
I grew up in a small town [ in, + in ] southern Oklahoma	24
It's a piece of <laughter>, -	24
great.	21
Yeah.	15
{D You know, } [ I wasn't, + [ [ I, + I d-, ]  + I ] watched ] only a few minutes of it	24
I know,	36
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
You know what I, -	26
{F Oh, } I see.	29
# Uh-huh. #	15
{F Um. }	26
I'm not having any problem it's a seventy.	24
They're both very good.	24
But water pollution, uh, -	26
{F Um. }	26
[ {C or, } +  {C but, } ] {F uh, } -	26
that's right.	36
uh-huh,	4
{F uh, } it [ use to be + -- -- use to ] [ be a, + {F uh, } {F uh, } have a ] lot of heavy industry,	3
if I play a lot of golf, I play six to eight times a year	24
{D see } when I go out to think about a new car or buy another car,  I don't think about, {D well, } is this engine that I can work on <laughter> or that, {D you know, } my husband can work on or whatever,  {D you know }	24
they are, -	36
{C but, } he's pretty good.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yes.	4
{C So } I try not to, -	24
{C And, } {F uh, } I was able to pick up a few things in there,	24
# Yeah,	36
{C but } it's remarkable [ that the, + that the ] bigger vans, {F uh, } they're, {F uh, } -	9
Yeah,	15
Does your husband work with T I.	7
[ That is one, + that's  ] a law that went into effect, {A I don't know } a year or two ago.	24
Oh.	15
that's funny <throat_clearing>.	21
{C but } {D you know, }  you ought to get him to [ g-, +  pull ] the weeds.	18
Yeah.	15
and that's # one that, -	26
if   I were a dentist, I'd want to be protected, too.	24
{C so } that's going between Atlanta, [ Washing-, +  D C ] area,	24
{C And, } {F uh, } I don't know if you get that kind of greeting or not.	8
Yeah.	15
You can play with your friends,	9
yeah.	15
{C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } [ I ma-, + I make  ] a lot of my Christmas presents,	24
{D like, }  especially lately there's been so many babies, <laughter> [ that, + ] {F uh, } bibs and blankets, and things like that.  Wall hangings, {F um, }	24
{C and } leave it in the car and then throw it away?	25
# {F Huh. }  Gosh. #	21
{C but } you happen to look the other way during the time,	24
Yeah.	36
{C but } I couldn't imagine that they came in and painted it, the whole ceiling, {D you know, } just within a couple of hours.	9
Great,	21
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
# [ In theory, + # in theory, ] a healthy economy has a lot of spending going on.	24
<Laughter> {C And } {D you know } [ the, + they   have the ] no shorts deal,	24
-- {C and, } {F uh, } -	26
That probably makes it easier,	9
# {F Oh, } yeah,	32
they're talking about doing that again, too.	24
{C and }  (( strange ))  it seems that, {F uh, } -	9
{F Uh, } not very often.	5
Yeah.	15
I can even take the  ((   )) -	24
It comes out just perfectly spaced like a block.	24
{C and } the -- -	26
{C and } [ {C then, } +  {C then } ] many of them ended up just working the  same jobs they were as slaves then.	24
an, -	26
{C and } those guidelines keep getting lessened and lessened because they have to do it to make the system work.	9
Would that be so bad?	7
Oh.	15
right.  #	36
Uh-huh.	15
I was halfway listening while # I was painting <lipsmack> <laughter>. #	24
-- {C and then } they have thousands and thousands of samples that, {F uh, } going through it in a day and <baby_crying> bottles get mixed up, things like that.	24
# Oh.  #	15
{C and } sure enough, {D you know, } we [ d-, + ] had really mild weather until -- -- I think it was May or something --	24
I can't remember his name.	24
my wife participated in a jury trial <lipsmack>  several years back -- -- wherein the individual after it was over and they, had came up with the maximum sentence -- -- in the jury form they found out that, {F uh, }  the gentleman involved had a long history of the same type offense -- -- which was theft # of # -- -- {F uh, } property.	24
{C because } a lot of things that you saw on TV, -	26
I, -	26
{C and so } that the other people have no health insurance -	9
{C And, }  [ was, + I was ] the first one, of anyone  [ that, + that ] anyone had ever known, <laughter> to have a divorce.	24
No,	33
I, -	26
{E I mean } -- -- # your # kids need you <bird_squawk>.	9
Most of them do the -- -- best they can.	9
# Saving them for you, {F uh. }  #	22
{C and } they died <cough> <<in background>>.	24
Yep.   *[[slash error]] Uh-huh.	36
{C but } I've heard from people who tried to get by and skimp on narrow masking tape that it was more trouble than it was worth. Because [ it, + it ] rips as you pull it off for one thing	24
Okay.	29
Right,	15
{D well, } I have a very comfortable car -- -- {C and } I have a health problem that I need a large comfortable car.	24
Yes.	36
<noise>  I can't stand the thought of giving blood.	24
{F Oh, } yeah,	15
There's one or two others that just, -	26
Yeah,	4
I like some ambiance,	24
that's really good.	9
Sure.	15
# That's right.  ((   )) . #	36
Government is going to have to change in this regard.	9
I think it's Friday night.	24
# <Laughter>. #	20
I think it was one of Kennedy's hot points  that he, -	24
# Have enough.  #	2
<Noise> <<background>> Uh-huh.	15
{C And } he's their head chauffeur,	24
# Right. #	15
# <Door>.  #	20
{C But } {D you know, } surprisingly,  [ [ I, + I, ] + ] because you put such a commitment on education, {F um, } your children probably could have  gone to schools with, {F uh, } {F uh, } a higher student teacher ratio, and still done well, because when they would  come home, you and your wife, would say, {D you know, } what did you do today,	9
Huh-uh,	36
{F well, } it's about a man, {F uh, } that, {F uh, } leaves his home and comes back to his wife,	24
<Laughter>.	20
Went out and looked.	24
{C So } I would say that's one of the  largest changes [ in, +  at least in ] my life.	24
{D So } life just changes a little bit in that respect <breathing>.	24
Uh-huh.	4
Yes,	36
{E I mean, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] sort of understand somewhat.	24
No,	33
I used to be a reporter.	24
Okay,	15
{E I mean, } I'm all for donating my time to worthy  causes,	24
That's the one that my father, -	24
{C so } it's -- -- a lot more interesting trying to, {F uh, } -	9
yes,	15
{C and } [ you would have sent, + you would have been ] the one that sent their invitation to them, and ask for their information.	24
okay.	15
{D Well, } that, and in the schools, too -- -- starting to put metal detectors in,	9
Yeah,	15
{C and } it was passed	24
Right.	15
{C and } I'm going to try and do that this summer.	24
No,	33
# {F Oh, } # really?	12
How many cats do you have?	39
# {F Oh, } whoa,	21
{C and, } {F uh, }  they're wonderful technology,	24
[ if, + if ] you're going to go camping, who wants to deal with bugs	16
# {C and } # I work with adolescents,	24
{C and } you cut up tomatoes and lettuce and grated cheese,	24
Down here, Dallas, seems to me, the police are militant --	9
I happened to be in Nassau	24
{F Uh, } {D well } it seems to me that kindergarten is now the equivalent of first grade.	34
{D Well, } I know that friends of mine had a baby up in Boston --	24
thanks.	38
{F Oh, } okay,	29
it's not in the switch, because it does the same thing with the new switch.	24
# I'm saying that # [ the, + {F uh, } the ] group that is just  trying to survive from day to day, where both parents are working -- -- is more of the majority [ than the, + than the ] people that  have the higher standard of living.	9
I don't have any  idea.	34
Are there many?	7
and she had been driving, a truck for seven years.	24
I don't think you have to register a shotgun <squeak>.	9
[ I never, + I never ] saw a riot. # Did you? #	24
{C but } I like to, {F uh, } play tennis and play racquetball --	24
I guess, <lipsmack> {D well, } [ there's, + there's ] probably two or three different types [ of, + of ] views as far as the controversy goes.	9
# Uh-huh. #	15
# Yeah. #	15
[ I, + I ] guess I really don't know cats that well because my mother never liked them,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D You know, } you get to the point where [ it's, + I'm ] never going to get done.	9
{C but } [ we, + we ] enjoy going looking at houses	24
{C and so } we had plenty of room and  everything,	24
Well, they should start with, the,	9
I think that's why a lot of people go to see him, though <laughter>.	9
Yeah.	15
All right,	13
{C but, } -	26
Yeah.	15
{C or } I may be working around in the room somehow,	24
{F Uh, } {D you know, } I would, -	26
Yeah,	15
{C and, }  I think,  that they could get some results from that, because there are a lot of people who are volunteer  and community minded,	9
{F Oh, } okay.	29
Oh.	15
It sounds {D like } you probably know  qui-, -	9
{C but } we are not a farming -- -- person <laughter>.	24
I was going on my way home from Thanksgiving --	24
[ {D well } what will, + {D well } what happens ] then is that <smack> they cancel, because they just can't cancel an individual.	24
{D Well, } the first thing for me is [ I wonder, +  I see ] a couple of different ways of talking about what privacy is, {F um, } if [ privacy is  something that disturbs your private state, +  {E I mean } an invasion of privacy  is something that disturbs your private state, ]	9
which is good for them,	9
{C But } their boat slept about four people plus had a little kitchen.	24
{C but } it's that you are there when they need you.	9
she was holding her  pencil in the right fingers and stuff.	24
They could basically, {F uh, } <noise> -	26
Yeah <breathing>.	15
[ [ I, +  {F uh, } I, ] + I ] like the way it is.	24
{C but } -- -- they're just made out of the beef, {D you know. } And, {F uh, } with spices and things in them. But never anything mixed with Bisquick.	24
my father always told me if you put hot food in your refrigerator you're going to make it work too hard.	24
{D Actually, } I hyper extended it or something,	24
Not like that.	36
{C and then } you dial in an access code	24
Yes.	15
<Laughter>.	20
No,	36
{C and } my balances are practically zero  on the ones that I have.	24
{C or } [ I, + # I'm # ] significantly shaken by the situation, # but # not devastated.	24
# Yeah,	15
{E I mean } like [ the, + the ] # jazzercise would be? # -	8
{C And, }  {F uh, } <barking>, that's true,	9
me too.	36
Yeah.	36
[ {D Well, } + {D well } ] you'd think so	9
{C but } leave it up to the more experienced person who knows how it fits into the, {F uh, } kind of the rate for different #  ((   )) . # -	22
Wow.	21
Yeah.	15
then their sons do it.	24
Yeah,	36
Yeah,	15
as you get to a certain number of miles, you have to get everything replaced, brakes, shocks and all that.	24
{C and } they're the ones that are  having problems not only getting along with the other kids but academically, # because # [ [ they were not, + they're should be, ] +  there's to many ] things in their way,   *[[to should be too]]	24
Okay.	15
<Laughter>.	20
<Laughter>.	20
{F Oh, } my gosh.	21
{C but } do you actually watch it, pay attention to it	7
{C and } [ they just, +   they'd ] look at you like, do I know you?	24
{E I mean, } -	26
Yep,	36
really.	36
{F Oh, } really.	12
Huh.	15
[ {C And, } + {C And then, } ] {F uh, } {F uh, } dessert.	24
{F Oh, } it's easy to get gas mileage in this car,	24
{C and } I s-, no <laughter>.	24
{C But, }  {F uh, } [ i-, + it's ]  worth it once you get it.	9
I kind of got burnt out on Steven King, though.	24
I think so.	24
{C And } {F uh, } one of the guys  that was on the jury they were asking him [ if, +  if ] you could believe a lawyer or if a, # lawyer's # reputation was so  tainted that he couldn't be believed	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but, } {F uh, } I'm looking at, {F uh, } doing a lot more of it because, {D you know, } my wife is really into it,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Bye, now.	38
You know what I did.	16
{C and } I got up	24
Wake up.	18
Did they replace it?	7
What about Utah?	31
Exactly.	21
{C And, } {F uh, } that was, -	26
{F Oh } [ I've be-, + <laughter> I've been ] lots of places.	24
Uh-huh.	15
<Laughter>  That's exactly right	21
we seem to be degenerating here,	9
I usually do if I'm home for a couple of days, {D like, } {D you know, } around Christmas or whatever,	24
Yeah,	36
Huh?	14
{C So, } I don't like to go the whole day  without hearing anything.	24
{F Oh, } from Texas.	29
[ I, + I ]  really can't either.	24
No,	33
Yo, Adrian <<imitates Rocky>>.	25
I don't know,	19
{E I mean } [ the steel, +  {E I mean, } the  thickness, ] -	9
{C but } our two [ had, + had, ] {F uh, } totally different interests of, -	24
Which some of the songs on K V I L can.	9
we learned to take nap, + and to take naps, ]	25
I don't have anything to look at	24
{F Oh, } we loved it.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Um, } then again, I don't know really what steps there are that they, -	9
Hi.	6
yeah,	26
Uh-huh.	15
{D You know, } a lot of the, {F uh, }  diskettes were just totally unusable.	24
{E I mean } it was just like, -	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C and } I'd be at  the swimming pool by four o'clock. {F Oh, } {D actually } about four thirty because  they start at five to six,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } I know Kay's company, {D you know, }	24
I do not know whether the jury system, {F uh, } -	24
My house is on a main road,	24
It's very generous	9
-- {C and then } you get to eat  everything afterwards,	24
{C And } it was in the floor	24
{E I mean, } {F um, } [ ye-, +   in the winter time yes, ]	24
I appreciate the call.	38
{D Well, } I have interesting conversations with a lot of these people because, {F um, } many of them, of course, their minds are not good.	24
That's what my mom does, labor and delivery.	24
Right,	15
{C and } {D you know, } I've never bought butter <laughter> -- -- and things like that.	24
On top of the recreational vehicles.	24
{C and } I was taking Entex. {C And } my doctor gave me a prescription for it.	24
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
I think, {F um, }  I'm lucky though that, {F um, } my wife <smack>  will probably not have to work  while our children, # are # under four, # or # five.	24
well I've been around a lot of people lately at wo-, at my job that don't have a lot of values <laughter>.	9
I'm trying to think.	24
Then I finally made it to England, too, {F uh, } on my way home, {F um, }	24
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
# {F Uh } [ I s-, + # I sure ] hope so.	24
{C but } I hadn't read that one.	24
# Yeah. #	15
I'm not sure we have the right solution to it,	9
{F oh, } that was so good.	9
Okay.	15
{C And } he did, {F uh, }  mention Beginning Experience Weekends as [ one of the, + {D you know, } one of the ] places.	24
he really wished he could be here, rather than there.	24
I was there [ during the, +  during the ] trial actually,	24
Yeah.	36
we, -	26
Yes.	15
My God.	21
<Laughter> Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Possibly before.	9
--  I think that the whole credit  card issue, I think they certainly encourage people to run up the debts	9
{C and } [ that, +   that's ] true, {F uh, } {F uh, } {D you know, }	9
The way it works.	24
We have a, -	24
Right,	36
{C and } she was fine,	24
I don't know anybody that actually supports abortion,	24
I don't know,	19
{D Well, } that, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
[ [ I, + I, ] {D You see, } I'm ] from west Texas.	24
Is it supposed to be better?	16
{C and } I have many a time called him to come get me, {D you know. }	24
{C and } I feel like a native.	24
I do some, -	26
{D you know, } da-, {D you know. } -	26
Yeah.	15
{C And } they repacked the wheel bearings.	8
# Yeah,	36
Right.	15
I don't think the United States, -	9
you just, -	26
I do to because it's amazing, how much, {D you know, } trash, # we can generate, #	9
Really?	12
Yeah,	4
{F Oh, } {D well, } that's good too.	9
No <laughter>.	32
We were going to go for ten weeks, {F uh, } in nineteen eighty	24
Uh-huh.	15
Right.	15
we were thinking about getting (( )) cat	24
{C And } they fix you  up with a diet, which worked real good.	24
{F Oh, } okay.	29
I thought that was your line # <laughter>. #	24
{C and } one child gets in free.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{E I mean } <laughter> I was soaking wet.	24
{F Huh. }	26
[ We, + we ] couldn't survive [ [ in a sy-, + in a juror syst-, ] + in a trial system ] without a jury.	9
{C but, } as far as a habit at the house, {F uh, } I haven't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants to pick up.	24
{F Oh, } [ we have had, + {F uh, } as I've said,  we have had ] variable weather. {F Uh, }	24
it's just that left knee that just doesn't want to do everything it used to.	24
The older kids had wanted one, though,	24
<Laughter> {C And } [ would you, + {F uh, } would it ] be appropriate to, {F uh, } drink [ with the, + ] {F uh, } [ prior, + ] when you have the hors d'oeuvres?	7
# I think so, #	36
[  They, + they ] have had Speak and Spell and  all that for years --	24
{F um, } interesting, [ my, + when my ] daughter was  in high school, one of the custodians was Vietnamese --	24
Yes,	4
if you dripped it on something, as long as you wiped it up, it was real easy to clean.	24
yeah,	26
{C but. }  What else would be an annoyance?	39
{C so } I don't really have a lot of, {F uh, } concrete, {F uh, } opinions.	24
Oh, yeah,	36
{D so, }    *[[slash error]] Yeah.    *[[slash error should be 'b']]	13
you figured it was like Omaha, {D right? }	7
Oh.	15
Yeah,	15
Yeah,	36
{C so } I like the Bears.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } [ I, + I ]  figure it takes practice	24
{C And } [ it wa-, + it was ] good.	24
# {C And } # it can go on for ten, twenty, years.	24
{C and } I'm in the van, {D you know, } {F uh, } two hours a day	24
Yeah,	38
Absolutely not <laughter>.	36
I just felt terrible.	24
{C So } -- -	26
I think, {F uh, } -	26
{F Uh, } I don't even use a calculator for the stuff I'm doing because it's all pretty round numbers.	24
People aren't going to vote for someone they've never heard of.	9
{C But } like I said I hardly ever get any calls this time.	24
I know so,	24
{C And, } {F uh, } who do you have her, or him, take it from?	39
that would be a real good motivation for people.	9
basically [ it, + it ] was called MUSTANG MAGAZINE	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
It was hard to get used to those two different trash cans.	24
{C So, }  if it [ mows, + gets mowed, ] I do it normally.	24
(( yeah ))	26
I would, too.	36
{D So, } you're at the house you're not at the plant.	22
there's so  many people there [ that, + that ] get the kind of control  that's bad, {D you know, }	24
No.	36
{F Oh, } yes,	4
{C or. } -	26
I like to fish.	24
{C and } she said what she had, {F uh, } just Mexican food,	24
{F Oh, } that's great.	21
it's a loaded cannon.	9
[ That's, + that's ] very true.	36
{C or, } if they do, [ they, + they ] drive with one little buddy, {F uh, }	9
{C And } it was really, what I felt was kind of cynical	24
and we had one child when I taught for my two year career.	24
That would be certainly nice	9
it's our last hope <laughter>.	24
You can't # find them. #	2
# {C And } [ I, + I'm ] not # so sure they are that needed.	9
{C and } my youngest was only, {F uh, } two and a half <sniffing>.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D you know, } can you compare yourself to any thing around there.	7
{F Uh, } most of the agriculture, it's more in the  way of, {F uh, } sheep and  cattle.	24
{F Uh, } how do we take care of the house.	17
Yeah.	15
Learned about their basketball team <laughter>.	24
<Laughter> yeah,	36
Not let them go and get out of it.	24
<Laughter>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
But. -	26
{C So, } I don't know,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Okay.	29
Yeah.	15
((   ))  [ [ have you, + have you  ever, ] + have you ever  ] been mugged in Atlanta?	7
{D So, } -	26
{C and } I don't think like that.	25
This edition is published by Bonanza Books.	24
<Child_talking>.	20
he keeps [ a s-, + ] {F uh, } food out there, year round.	24
I do too,	36
<Laughter> # {C And }  ((   ))  # -- -	26
Really?	12
{C but } fortunately I had small children	24
We also need to, {F uh, } assure that there's some work in the private sector.	9
{C and then } I went and looked [ and, + ] to see what my visa was	24
{D well, } [ I -- + -- I ] hardly ever watch it,	24
I don't see this  ((   ))  changing my lifestyle a whole lot.	9
she only taught there one year	24
it was beautiful,	9
Uh-huh.	15
Those are cool.	9
Yeah.	15
He says, {D Well, } I already  told you my sons a lawyer.	24
{D So, } {F uh, } [ she, + she's ] real interested in, {F uh, } what Ann Richards has been doing.	24
{D you know } Iran couldn't do it in seven years	9
{D So, } what, {D you know, } -	26
I'm very busy,	24
Yeah.	15
[ I, + I ] never really was a Cowboys fan until I moved down to Texas.	24
For sure.	21
Apparently they don't think it's a problem <laughter> <breathing>.	9
[ I don't, + I don't know ] what else.	19
{C and } he wanted to marry her,	24
{C But } not a lot I could do about it.	24
{F Uh, }  one thing, {F uh, } I've done all sorts of camping.	24
Yeah.	15
# Right. #	15
{C but } it [ was much, + {D you know, } is at least twice if not ] more expensive than <throat_clearing> the regular health care.	24
{F Oh } [ that, + that ] you mean about the, # mix itself.  #	22
{C And } it's not like the kids are going to go a lot longer,	9
What was the age difference between the youngest  and the oldest?	39
{D Well } of course, everything we're saying is being recorded	24
uh-huh.	15
there can be no shadow of a doubt in my mind,	24
Uh-huh.	15
it's a little too, {F uh, } ronky tonk or something.	24
my work is my hobby <laughter>.	24
[  If, + if ] a child is a visual learner, we're supposed to present him with all these visual things,	24
{D you know, } [ {C or, } + {C and } ] you can kind of relate to it -- -- {D you know, }	9
{C And } [ there are, + there are ] woman there	24
The only thing really that can be changed is for [ us to, + everybody to ] say, we've had enough of you, out you go.	9
[ We're, + we ] sold all that litter,	5
All  (( righty )) .	13
It's the longest, -	26
[ I, + I ] believe he was opposed to the conviction	24
{D Well, } -	26
you must have a lot of different stuff you get out of there,	9
Okay.	15
I think that is [ a, + a ] positive thing for them after, {F um, } {F uh, } thousands of years,	9
[ I think, + I think ] that [ they're s-, + they're so ] much more vulnerable now because they don't receive support -- -- from the Soviet Union	9
# <<faint>>. # Yeah	20
# Uh-huh. #	15
If only it would make nice snow here in Texas, we'd be okay at Christmas time.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C and then } the third year we,  {F um, } got heating	24
-- all his movies, I [ really, + really  ]  ((   )) . -	26
my husband has just gotten stuck.	24
-- they have to see for themselves --	9
do you know what I mean?	16
# {C So } not only do you # -- -	26
{F um, } I'm married	24
Yeah.	36
[ there's, + there's ] a few,	24
I get calls at home,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D So, } -	26
{C and, } {F uh, } do that [ on a, +  on a ] full time basis here in town.	24
I was influenced by all different kinds of music	24
Yeah,	15
Bring some of these things out.	2
{E I mean } it's like  [ his mother, + his, mother ] came over	24
-- [ {C and } I think maybe, + {F uh, } {C and } ] that's [ the type of, + the ] thing that should be, # {D you know, } stressed. #	9
{C but } -- -- yeah,	26
Uh-huh.	15
it is,	36
is it one, -	26
{C So, }  [ wh-, + ] I feel that I learned a  great deal from my students, {F uh, } with regard to what their biggest complaints were with parents.	24
Huh.	15
{D you know, } {C but. } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
I don't know if you, have you ever been there?	7
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } {C but } we both work	24
I like Costner a lot	24
about six months ago I started --	24
right.	36
-- {C and } it's really sad.	9
Yeah.	15
{C and } [ he's, + he'll ] be eighty this year.	24
Right.	15
{C So } I'm going,	24
Yes,	36
{C and } I suddenly started to understand what burning eyes, and all that stuff is about that I'd always heard about.	24
change the rower # <laughter>.	25
# <Dishes>.  #	20
{C and } everyone brings in food --	24
Yeah,	36
Have, -	7
Uh-huh.	15
isn't that funny.	16
{C and } I thought it was more because of [ the, + the  ] very transient nature of the area -- -- and that people were going basically just as you said, as a social to meet people, and that,	9
# Yeah. #	15
[  You, + you ] have a soy sauce taste	24
{C But } we don't get any snow anymore.	24
{C But } now, in order to seem, {D you know, } humane and normal, we do allow them to watch cartoons and stuff.	9
{C And  then, } {D you know, } you're trying to make  [ the, + the ] Wave smooth	25
It really does.	24
{C and } I've never faced that at all.	24
{C and then } [ they, + they ] have the club championships and everything with the women's slots as well,	24
{C But } it's just a lot cheaper [ than, + than ] Domino's,	9
I don't know,	34
Hm.	15
{C but } as I look back now I realize it was very formative for me,	24
Of course it wasn't sunny like it is here.	24
{C and } she kind of heads that up for these kids,	24
That is kind of wild.	21
Now we did, what we sometimes do since we are in Ohio	24
{C and } sometimes they have to pay even less taxes.	24
Uh-huh.	15
How nice.	21
{C And } we went to the, -	24
AWAKENING  [ was, + [ it + ] was ] kind of sad to me.	24
[ He's only about, + I guess he's about ] two and a half in his real understanding of things.	24
# Maybe #	3
supposedly, the  maintenance records was supposed to be registered with Honda or whatever	24
{F Uh, } [ I, + I ] work for T I.	24
Yeah,	15
I don't either.	24
that's cool.	21
that, -	26
right,	36
yes.	4
[ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C so } ] I tried to make it, after  I sold my business -	24
{F Uh, } I've worked [ [ for, + for ] +  ((   )) for ]  awhile	24
those are fun to do,	9
that just does not go.	24
# Have you ever, # -	7
{C And, }  {F uh, } {F uh, } [ that, + that ] may have been [ [ a, + a, ] + a ] kind of far out way of thinking about it I don't know.	9
{C and } I probably got more nasty <laughter> than I should have.	24
{C and } they wanted us  to have more brick,	24
{F Um, } occasionally.	11
I have a thirteen  year old and an eleven year old,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } it came in an envelope that says DANCES WITH WOLVES	24
# Because # the ones that aren't so good  [ don't, + just don't ] make it.	24
# Uh-huh,	15
I know they're always churning that up --	9
{C and, }  {F uh, } it doesn't matter who they put in office, they're going to fall subject to, {F uh, } the pressure that the lobbyists can put,	9
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } that's basically what happened with us  is we bought a computer,	24
<Laughter> {C So, } {F uh, } yeah	15
{C Because } that was just so good.	9
Uh-huh.	15
In fact I'm sure they don't.	24
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah.	4
I would agree with you there <laughter>.	36
Not just exercise, but, [ health, + health ] related ideas.	9
{C and } when you -- -- have children -- -- {F uh, } watching it, that sometimes really starts to bother me --	9
same here.	38
She likes to sew and do crafts and things like that <laughter>.	24
Uh-huh,	4
we're talking some of it's been  (( peeled ))  away, {D you know, }	24
My housekeeper was baby-sitting my cats and dogs,  <noise> <<high pitched trill>> said something to the effect of, now we've made the national news, don't get upset, and don't worry,	24
# [ [  My, +  my, ] +  it's kind of odd. My ]   roommate that I live with here,  [ he's, + {F uh, } he's  ] lived in Pennock, Minnesota.   *[[two utts?]]	24
one of the things with my company is that they've, {F uh, } got a reputation for a lot of job security	24
# Yeah. #	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } there's, {F um, } EQUAL JUSTICE, some other one, LAW AND ORDER or something.	24
Yeah --	15
{C So, }  {E I mean, } they are killing buffalos in it.	24
[ I'm, + I'm ] kind of bad about that.	24
{F Oh, } yeah,	15
and I don't have an incentive to get rid of it as long as it keeps running good and not costing me any money.	24
no.	36
is there anything I believe in <laughter>.	7
{C and } {D you know, } [ I, + I ] think there's, -	26
# {C and } # it's the fastest thing to do,	24
{F uh, } hit it to him,	9
then, [ and + ] [ I, + I ] usually put the cut up tomatoes next -- -- and then the, {F um, } lettuce,	24
I had a rock to weight it down,	24
Yeah.	15
{C And, } I know that, {F uh, } the results that they get out of the system sometime [ is, + is ] certainly not <breathing>, {D you know, } up to what the effort they put into it, {D you know, }	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } <laughter>. -	26
[ I, + I ] agree with  you.	36
{C And } all of that was new to me,	24
{F Oh, } okay.	29
I got a woman in New Jersey the last time I called, I think.	24
{C and } I still have the old standby crabgrass here and there,	24
{C And } the side that's on  [ the, + {F uh, } the ]  other side is about six feet high.	24
that sort of upset me,	24
{C And } that's the BOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL and  AS THE WORLD TURNS.	24
{C and } you've got to let [ those, + {D you know, } those, ] -	9
Yes,	15
Hi,	6
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } it's probably more generating power for, {D you know, } {F uh, } electricity, a hundred and twenty volt or whatever.	24
{C And } [ it, + it's ] just {D like } a chore to pick up my feet. Because I'm used to wearing the little [ whi-, + white ] girl tennis shoes.	24
{C and } she's not limping along and all that.	24
-- {C because } that's great.	21
and I should have checked more carefully and done a better job of saving the receipt,	9
Yeah,	36
probably like you said, to be able to travel some place else whether  it be the United States or  outside the country, I think it would have been a very good, {F um, } experience for me.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Right.	15
{C and } you put a bay leaf and put some, {F uh, } red pepper over it.	18
It's easier	9
{C but } I think it might be them.	9
[ {C And } I, + {C and } [ it, + that ] ] choice was there,	24
{C and } some places, [ [ they, + they, ] + they ]  really  (( nail ))  them for tax.	24
[ We were in the, +  we were in the ] woods, {D you know. }	24
do we get a signal.	7
[ I, + I  ] find that's my one release <laughter>,	24
Got to carry through with the abuse, huh.	23
{C and } it was just, -	26
<Laughter>.	20
Right.	15
{F Huh. }  What's that about?	39
{C but } yet, you can't stop people from having, {D you know, } a handgun in their home.	9
{C But, } {F uh, } [ I, + I ] think he kind of follows the sports	24
Yeah.	4
{C but } <phone_ringing>. -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C So, } I guess, in Texas with, -	26
I recycle {D like } zip lock bags  and, things like that.	24
# No,	33
{C but, }  {F uh, } mostly [ it's, + it's ] kind of science fiction,	24
yeah,	26
and the last one that I pic-, was here, uh, -	24
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } my kids go to school in another suburb of Dallas.  [ And, + ] with very, very good school systems.	24
Okay.	38
{F Oh, } <laughter> okay,	29
Oh, really?	12
{C but } I, -	26
{C but, } {F uh, } I guess if [ I, + ] {F uh, } [ length of, + length of ] time I'm in the state now,  is [ what, + ] after you're here twenty years you're considered native.	24
{C and } they, -	26
Yeah,	15
Yeah.	26
Yeah,	15
it's, {D you know, } feasible,	9
Uh-huh.	15
-- {C because } the thing [ is, + is ] that, {D you know, }  it's like if I want something [ I'll, + I'll ] ask somebody, {D you know, }	24
{D well } [ that's a, + that's a, ] -	26
I-, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } she's about  ten pounds,	24
# {F Oh } yeah.  #	15
okay.	29
In South Africa I think they are,	9
-- {C but } I haven't upgraded it quite that far yet.	24
[ {C and, } + {C so } ] [ I, + {D you know, } I'm  ] not attracted to that at all,	24
It's not going to be that we're going  to, {F uh, } {D you know, } sort of, tell them to go to their room	9
{C Because } I was  just wondering, we went to Galveston [ this, +  this ] summer, even with all  the oil spills and everything,	24
It's kind of, -	26
we don't have cats	24
{D well } I'm not that great either.	24
yeah,	26
[ that's pretty har-, + that's pretty high,  ]	24
{C and then } I like that one after that where, {F oh, } -	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } they know that.	9
That type of show is [ what we -- + -- what, {F uh, } we ] watch.	24
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] she was dealing mostly with people that [ were, + were ] in on drug crimes	24
{C so } it was [ about, + almost  ] three hundred dollars for all three of them.	24
{F Oh, } [ wha-, + what ]  else can I tell you about painting?	16
[ you, + you ] pretty well know what you're getting ahead of time,	9
{C so } I was going to say if you're a Republican, boy we would really have a good time.	24
Camping or, {F uh, } motor home is nice, {F uh, } travel trailer, pop up,	24
Yeah,	15
[  We are, + we were ] really quite pleased with it.	24
that's good.	13
{D Well, } that's the good thing about  what is happening because I think more and more the news media, which takes a heck  of a beating [ and, +  and ] deserves some of it, is telling us, {D you know, }  about the problems.	9
I think that one of the best ways  to do that is for families to realize they are going to be needing those facilities one day, and to actually get involved and participate on a  community level with community service.	9
{C and } now I'm selling them and pretty, -	24
Yeah,	15
Yeah,	4
Uh-huh.	15
# [ Kind of get, + # Kind of get ] something to measure my responses by.	24
{C and then } that they would sort it [ as -- + -- as ] needed.	24
{F Oh, } {D well } that's that bad then.	9
that would force everybody to use it.  Or to quit selling tape measures in inches.	9
I never understand, {D you know, } -	24
I always liked him,	24
{C and } now it's down to {D like, } fourteen million.	24
Are you in Dallas?	7
Yeah.	15
{C And, }  {F uh, } {E I mean, } it comes bedtime	24
yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
Ugh.	21
yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
where they go for an hour or so.	24
[ I, + I ] don't think I'd  want to even if you could if they're that ugly,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } that was kind of another suspense type, Alfred Hitchcock type thriller.	24
{C But, } quite honestly what I believe to be the best day care situation was while we lived up, the Pass of Woodland Park -- -- there was, {F uh, } ex-school teacher that, {F uh, }  did a small amount of before school and after school, {D you know, } kindergartners,  or half dayers -- -- in her home <<pause>>	24
{C and } I understand also they want men.	24
{C And, } -	26
Yeah.	15
If you deal drugs, you can't live here.	25
# {F Uh, } Houston # has had some wonderful talent, {D you know, } down through the years	9
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
me and my brother both took the classes	24
I enjoy it.	24
{D Well, } that is not much.	21
{D well, } I guess I've been kind of off and on	24
Uh-huh.	15
I own my company.	24
I wish I could say that.	24
{C but, } -	26
{D Well } I guess we're kind of running out of steam on this # topic here. #	9
it is,	36
Really,	15
[ I wasn't, +  I [ didn't,  +  wasn't ] ] aware of that,	24
They are always friendly.	9
{D Well, } the, other issue [ [ is, + is, ] + is ] [ how do you allow, + {F uh, } [ how, + how ] do you allow ] injustice.  Just like [ the, + the ] policeman [ in, +  in ] Los Angeles -- -- [ how could, + how could, ] -	13
{D so, } {F uh, } do you own a P C?	7
Uh-huh. #	26
[ I, + I ] hold it in the utmost contempt.	24
[ That's why, + that's why ] I didn't apply.	24
okay, {F uh, }	26
You know, they really don't have any choice <laughter>.	9
-- [ we, + we ] have, {F um, } -	26
# {C And } [ I, + I ] just happen # to work  at a Waco station, because {D you know. }	24
Uh-huh.	15
it just, -	26
[ that's, + see that's ] what we did in Girl Scouts	24
The little box is  black on the top of the pyramid in the sun.	24
{F Um, } {C so } those are more or less  indoor sports.	8
The stations I listen to are just mainly music.	24
# {F Um. }  #	15
Is it really?	12
{C and } I will, {F uh, } check off what checks have cleared	24
Yeah.	15
I guess one of the things that I think about is a, talking about education, uh, I kind of feel like, uh, that, uh, the, the school systems in this, particularly in this area, the systems are not under enough control.	9
He was in the UNTOUCHABLES.	24
{C and } my son plays football.	24
{E I mean, } [ they're, + they're ] all pretty good,	9
<Clicking>.	20
[ I, +  {F uh, } I ] was thinking about buying a Prelude from a friend  who was moving to New York or something	24
{C But } I do carry {D like } my American Express and my Visa which I use for, {D you know, } primarily work type things.	24
{C so } there's only been really one working.	24
like I say, my brother-in-law  ((   )) .   I get to Carrollton quite a bit.	24
they did.	24
[ Does that, + does that ] cause any problems between the two of you?	7
when  I go out and play golf it's usually like [ at a, + at one of these ] par threes that, {D you know, } you, -	24
That's right.	36
{C So, } -	26
when you come to this part of the country, we've been away from Dallas long enough that you see the difference in housing.	9
yeah,	26
{C but } we've had her now for about three years,	24
He had a [ blue, + blue ] bowl a few weeks ago that [ he, + he ] fixed that way.	24
# Nothing # escapes, right?	7
# {D So. } # -	26
{E I mean } it's just, {F uh, }  as long as you want to, [ and + ] just, {D you know, } a reasonable lengthy conversation.	24
{C so } your name is valuable to, I guess, X amount of solicitors calling.	9
{C But, } {D you know, } [ there's f-, + there's ] a lot of taxes you pay that you're not even aware of that you're paying, {F uh, }	9
there's been cost of living increases	24
-- {C and } we couldn't get it to turn off,	24
we had a dentist come to our school and, {F uh, } check our teeth once a year at least.	24
Uh-hum.	15
{F Uh, } [ [ we, + we  ] get about, + [ our, + the  ] van [ gets,  + on highways, can get   about ] twenty-eight.	24
They're going to do what they want to do.	25
{D So } yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
{C and } the younger kids are at home,	24
Yeah.	15
<Laughter>.	20
{C so. } It's just crazy.	24
Right,	36
What if you're already on one?	39
[ I, + I ] think it was more a lesson for Tom Cruise than anything else in terms [ of, + {F uh, } of ] how to act from Dustin Hoffman,	9
definitely.	36
{F Um, } I've done some cross stitching.	11
{F Oh, } probably.	11
{C but } I never count right,	24
<Laughter> {D Well } anyway, I'm sorry	41
Yeah.	15
but he doesn't work on British cars any more, and gave me the name of somebody else to take a look at it.	24
Yeah.	15
it's becoming really health conscious	9
{C And then } we put our receipts  in there, {D you know, }	24
Yeah,	36
[ {C and, } + {D you know, } {C and, } ] {F um, } although I don't have  too serious a problem,	24
{C and, } {F uh, } what kind of dishes you might have for it, or -- -- some sort of thing like that.	24
{C And } I will think, {F oh, } maybe I ought to get the rest of that out, {D you know, } and finish it.	24
Not up, {F um, } where I live	5
{F Oh, } do you?	12
yeah,	15
now there's almost equally predominant in women.	24
Uh-huh.	15
I think it should be in other cases other than  just shooting a policeman <laughter>.	9
My daughter's three, even though at this current time she's ready to get involved with, -	24
of -	26
I happened to be out there in the morning when they were picking up [ the, + that ] tub stuff,	24
{F Oh, } [ that is, +  that is ]  [ really, +  really ] something.	36
it's just [ like, +  something like ]  an onion and a tomato would go together, but you're not supposed to put your onions  near your beans.	24
{D Now, } not all of them will commit offenses that have to do with capital punishment,	9
Right.	15
# Yeah. #	15
Yes,	36
{C and } that's, {D you know, } a big expenditure to start, {F um, } buying all these  things that you think [ or, +  or ] have to have	9
I know,	21
Uh-huh.	15
[ when I, +  when they ]  were in elementary school they were [ identi-, +  identified ] as being slow.	24
{C And so } I can see from the company's standpoint that there, {F uh, } -	24
Uh-huh,	15
{C and, } {F uh, } [ why, + why  ] do we let this happen.	16
Uh-huh.	15
my [ brother, + {F uh, } brother ] used to work for Wal-Mart	24
you'd have, {D you know, } two or three more generations that all  now [ are, + are ] familiar with the metric system.	24
# {D Well, } have a good day. #	38
-- {E I mean, } you honestly do.	24
No.	33
unfortunately I bought them all three at the same time, when I bought my new house,	24
I can't do any of that,	24
# {F Oh, } why # yeah.	15
{F Oh, } # I don't know <static>. #	24
fine.	15
I don't know.	34
It must not be according to [ their, + how they ] did during the year.	24
Yeah.	4
Sure.	15
that doesn't make a whole of lot sense.	9
I have a set amount  [ that I, + that I ] save.	24
{E I mean, } [ it, + he ] goes to [ a, + a ] mother's day out program now once a week.	24
{C But, } -	26
No.	36
{C And } here in Houston, as well as just about any big city anywhere across this country, -	24
{C and } I'm sure a lot of them don't.	9
{D Well, }  I have, [ I guess + ]  about said [ what + ] [ a-, + all ] I can think of to say.	24
# Bye. #	38
Uh-huh.	15
Communication, {D you know, } expands the world now.	9
{C but } I just assume it was something that she could hit immediately [ and, + and ] really annoy a lot of people.	24
you can hear my dog <barking>.	9
{C and } she cooks them for an hour with some  (( fat backs )) , <laughter>,	24
{F Uh, } used oil base paints for trim -- -- {D you know, } {D like } around doors [ and, + and ]  on doors, things like that.	11
just light reading that are, -	24
{C so. } -	26
{C because } anyone who has children that doesn't really want them isn't going to be a good parent.	9
That's true.	9
We're into {D like, } have to have it all now.	9
[ Recently, + I can't really say recently.  ]	5
{F Uh, } {D well } how is it appropriate to be talking about exercise attitudes?  <Breathing> <laughter>.	31
{C But, } no,	13
{C and } they were very happy with the system,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Okay.	15
My husband doesn't enjoy the shows as much going to them,	24
Yeah,	4
{F Huh. }	15
you know, doing the maintenance and everything on them as long as we didn't have to do it very often.	24
That's tough.	21
yeah,	15
-- {C but, } {F uh, } [ I'm, + I'm  ] trying to get a, {F uh, } intern position with I B M right now so that I can find an area to do my dissertation in.	24
Right.	15
you know,	26
I don't know [ if you, + {F uh, } if you ] approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on installing something like that.	9
thirty minutes was definitely plenty.	24
yeah.	15
that  turned out to be a really good experience for me.	24
{C so. } -	26
Yeah,	4
CHEERS?	7
Think we've, {F uh, } covered all the subject.	38
Sure.	21
Yeah,	29
I would think so.	36
Yeah	4
# <Laughter> {D Well, } tell me,	18
and I, -	26
Oh.	29
Yeah,	36
<<very faint>>.	20
They should have been in there longer.	9
Yeah,  {D well, }	15
I look at our big green containers,	24
{F Oh, } you get that stuff in the mail all the time.	24
[ I, + I've  ] dealt with quite a few of them.	24
You want blue?	7
{E I mean, } {D you know, } if it's just downright, outright, -	24
I kept waiting for, -	26
Uh-huh.	4
[ {C and, } + {D you know, } {C and } ] try and do [ what's, +  what ] I can do out of it that's practical,	24
it was all bloodless --	24
{C and } for some reason I just went back, and on my own went around the different floors.	24
that's, -	26
{F Uh, }	26
{C But } then I also, -	26
{C And } the oil companies [ are, + really aren't ] responsible, {D you know. }	9
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
he's a jazz flute player	24
-- we drive sixty-five.	24
Yeah.	15
that, -	30
{C so } I've, {D you know, } worked most of my life.	24
I think we did,	9
yes.	4
I, don't know,	19
{C and } [ we always, + we never ] get [ the, + the ] credit cards if there's a monthly, or a yearly charge.	24
{C And so, } {F uh, } -	26
{C And } you see these guys standing there watching you jump around in your <laughter> leotards.	24
{D well, } any other comments.	7
{C and } the other one is out on the porch.	24
{C and } I know it,	24
{D Well, } presumably those who find out such  information, if they are doing it, I would prefer to not to be known,	24
{C So } I guess we're all [ in, + ] {F uh, } {D you know, } movie, {F uh, } fanatics or whatever around here.	24
Yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
I used to do them in the microwave,	24
{C but } {D yeah, }  I think sometime last year, or just recently they started to  give some kind of eye coverage.	24
Yes.	15
when you were talking about the composting,  the only thing that our city did that was they [ di-, +  {F uh, } provided ] a place for us to take our Christmas trees. {F Uh, } [ to +  for them to ] mulch. [ For, + for ] city use.	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } this thing says [ that, + that, ] {D you know, } [ it-, + ] people think, {D well, } cow manure is good for fertilizer	24
They were lost, {D you know, } when they  were little,	24
{C And } I got all ready to go	24
{C But, } {F uh, } like I said otherwise,  {D you know, } [ a-, +  the expense, ] -	24
{C and } there wasn't a tax on food that we purchased at [ the, + the ] grocery store and  things.	24
you know what I mean?	7
I'm thirty-two,	24
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] you grieve just as  much over them when they go -- -- {D you know, } as you would a child.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } she gets paid for forty.	24
I think the last one that we actually went to go see, -	24
{F Oh, } that's great.	21
Yeah,	15
I guess she wanted a private life.	24
Sure.	15
-- {C but, } {F uh, } the rest of the time I've been an <laughter> Avon lady and a ((   ))  lady.	24
{C And, } {F um, } there's some stuff that's really for, {F uh, } auto repair.	24
Uh-huh.	15
# Uh-huh.	15
{C And } [ I, + {D well, } I ] don't prefer to read a lot of the things like you might find [ at, + {F uh, } {D well, } {D like } at ] a Target or  a supermarket or something where they have a bunch of books out, paperback type books.	24
Uh-huh.	15
I don't think that if I, -	26
Now that's inside again,	24
The only way we'd get to them is by telephone.	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C Or } you'll hear thirty and think, {D boy } -- -- I got my game together.	24
There's, no love for the Broncos.	24
No,	36
I have a hard time inventing shots, {D you know. }	24
{E I mean } they do that now	9
{D Well, } {F uh, } yeah,	4
{C and} he said that if you pull a gun on a robber, he's going to assume that you know how to use it well,	24
Yeah <noise>.	4
Crazy for him to	9
that's right.  #	36
I guess my husband got a letter at the office,	24
[ [ I want, + I want ] to be able  ((   )) + I just want it ] more for multi tasking, which I suppose is also like a Macintosh.	24
# {D Well, } # I heard tonight on  the news that he is willing to come down. # on his, # -	3
{E I mean, } {D like } the Arab societies and  stuff end up, {F uh, } having <throat_clearing> [ [ e-, + effective, ] + effective ] punishments	9
Exactly.	36
no.	36
{D Well } [ as, + as ] someone who [ would, + would ] possibly be in the role of an independent bystander, I feel more comfortable with people having blades because, {F uh, } you're not going to get <breathing> bullets flying around killing people instantly	24
Right.	36
I liked the sound of the harpsichord.	24
{E I mean } {C because }  it's just, -	24
I just want to enjoy <hum> not having any car payments for a while -- -- and enjoy watching my savings account get larger and, {F uh, } {D you know, } hang on to the one I've got for a few years because [ [ it's, + it's, ] + it's ] almost four years old,	24
{C and } we seem to be able to get along with the President turnover ever eight years or four years.	9
[ {C And so, } + {C And } ] yet [ they have, + they have ] a right to be here	9
Uh-huh.	15
I would not object if anybody did.	24
Yeah.	15
A lot of times when we do stir fry we just put in tofu,	24
{C And, } {E I mean, } I have some of the most beautiful day lilies that you've ever seen.	24
Right <laughter>.	38
do you think that there should be some control, {F uh, } innovated such that  the doctors are not allowed to charge ridiculously over priced things.	7
yeah.	15
{C And } this is something that had been going on for months.	24
{D Well, } {F uh, } I don't know.	19
{C and, } {F um, } [ I, + I ] guess they [ would, + would ] be more conservative, some of them I guess.	9
okay.	15
# {C and, }  # {F um, } {D well } I work all week,	24
I just, -	26
Yeah.	15
[ [ they, + they, ] + they'll ] check for alcohol.	24
[ {D like, } + {D like } ] are you talking about movies # like DIE HARD TWO. #	7
#  {C And } [ we, + right now, we ] don't own any property.	24
Yeah,	15
{C and } it went  up all the way to the head of facilities, complaining that we were wearing shorts.	24
I think it's, {F uh, } -	26
and, I mean, she told me about half the people that they hire	24
No.	33
Okay <laughter>.	29
Yeah.	15
[ {C And, } + {C So } ] [ we, + we ] didn't really have enough time.	24
-- {D you know, } the good ones do cost maybe sixty dollars a week # since ((   )) . # -	24
{C and } they come as far away  (( from ))  California,	24
Right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Hey <laughter>.	21
# Oh <<faintly>>. #	15
it sure does.  {F Um, }	36
Yeah.	4
school buses and the -- -- commercial buses,	22
Right.	15
Do you have bass?	7
{C and } especially if they're active kids.	9
# Yeah.  #	15
but I also, uh, think that people don't realize that their boat, vote will make a difference.	9
[ he is, + he's ] a big old thing.	24
No  <laughter>.	15
# {D Well, } # [ how about, + how about ] the reverse of that?	31
Is Texas one of them?	7
Yeah.	4
Yeah.	15
no kids.	24
Are you married at all?	7
you know what I mean?	7
I don't think he's really a very good actor.	9
Right.	15
Uh-huh.	36
Uh-huh.	15
I know my brother doesn't	24
{C and. } -	26
they were in very good financials at first	9
{D Now } do you still own a house?	7
There's a lot of us in it.	24
{C But } I haven't skied  Utah yet,	24
{D well, } that makes a really big  difference.	9
I just think there's a lot of other problems right now --	9
[ That's, + that's ] what some people call {D like } really heavy metal.	24
Gosh.	21
the, -	26
{C but } we seem to be lacking the ability to take a stance.	9
{D You know, } you get your little Sousa book	24
What did you think of the coverage of the war?	31
They don't, {F uh, } want the mothers to be with the little fish either.	22
{D Well, } {F uh, } if you had to pick [ a, + a ] type of music that you like, would you be able to?  *[[functions as a qw]]	7
I had the baby <laughter>.	24
yeah.	4
{C But, } {F uh, } <laughter> that's just  since, in the past say about six years.	24
everyone has a boss, of course.	9
Okay,	29
{C and, } {F uh, } the child care center <noise> associated with our university was quite good	24
# Uh-huh <laughter>. #	15
{C So, } We are looking forward to that.	24
{C but } they've all gotten grown up now --	24
Yes,	36
Bye.	38
Yeah,	36
{C but } apparently they just really are.	9
{F Oh, } God <laughter>.	21
{C And, }  {F uh, } they've got these, I don't know what, if you're familiar with Sarasota county at all.	8
The on line  encyclopedia just sounds wonderful,	9
I love it.	24
# Exactly. #	36
they don't sell the list.	24
{C And } I think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay Pennsylvania what they believe they are owed even though, {D you know, } the revenue stream went to another state.	9
I like that real well.	24
That's right,	21
you know, # the same old cliche.  #	24
{C and } it's just a regular cheese cake,	24
This is nothing like cats.	9
I, {D you know, } -	26
it's a rite of passage <talking>.	9
<TV> {F Uh, } yes	4
-- {C and } [ I guess, +  [ I, +  I, ] guess ] Iraqi now is the <laughter>. -	24
Like I say, haven't done it [ in, + in ] such a long time.	24
[ Even the + <throat_clearing>, even the ] Mother's Day Out programs, I heard, are real good.	24
{F Oh, } my word.	21
{F Oh, } that's pretty good.	21
Okay,	29
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } {D well. } -	15
Everybody has a different thing.	24
Uh-huh.	4
{C And  then } they also, {D you know, } [ ask can we eliminate, + do you think we could make laws to eliminate ] all corruption,	24
{D Well, } we were lucky when our children were that age,	24
that's a good thing.	9
<Throat_clearing>.	20
[ we have a, + we do, ] {F uh, } {F uh, } middle eastern dinner quite a bit {D actually, }	24
Yeah,	4
I mostly look for the storms out in the ocean. {F Uh, } hundreds of miles out	24
I always objected, {D you know, }	24
{C and } they were matching	24
right.	15
It's a <breathing> two story colonial, which my wife and I designed.	24
Yeah.	4
{C and } you're thinking, <laughter> {F oh, } [ you would + not only would you ] not want to be a victim	24
{D well, } # -	26
Yeah,	30
especially with the real young ones.	24
Yeah,	15
{F Uh, } {D well, } I don't pretend to understand that either.	24
{C so } many people, -	9
About the only time we have, -	24
{C And, } -	26
Take a picnic lunch.	24
We can [ drive into, +   when we've been on vacation or  something drive into ] Fort Worth or Dallas	24
[  I, + I ] never buy new	24
<Click>.	20
{C but } I decided that I don't like  grass,	24
[ i-, +  I ] don't think that  that's the way to go in this	9
the  (( mold )) , everything is  (( white )) .	24
{F Oh, } absolutely.	36
Yeah,	36
Wow.	21
Bye now.	38
-- {C but, } {F uh, } they both went through preschool.	24
Yeah,	15
{C so } we both have our expertise side.	24
That's right.	21
Yeah,	26
{F Um, } what do you do?	39
That's right.	36
Uh-huh.	36
{C But, } by then it's so  late then the winter comes and it stops.	24
{C Because } [ it was, + {D you know, } it was ]  just a [ change of, + change of ] location	24
{C so } I don't even know what the law is, in the state,	24
Oh.	15
{F Uh, } I, -	26
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C so } ] yeah,	26
[ {C b-, } + {C and } ] I pay five dollars every time I visit [ the, + the ] hospital -- -- [ that, + ] {D you know, } for a checkup or whatever.	24
exactly,	36
there is a down side to all this, {D you know, } about no good deed going unpunished, that, {F uh, } my mother sells, {F um, } trees that they make paper out of,	24
{C and } she didn't bark at all until  she spent time there --	24
it just seems to me that [ [ only about, + {F uh, }  from what I read, only about ninety percent of the ca-, ] + only about ten percent of the  [ pa-, +  cases ] ] come for trial anyway.	9
Yeah.	15
Right,	15
Uh-huh.	15
-- I have to say that.	24
# Yeah.	36
What grade level would that be?	39
Okay.	29
Thanks.	38
{C But, } {D you know, } right now with the way our credit card situation is, there's nobody in the world that's going to give us a mortgage on a house.	24
they're both grown and married	24
I think that, {F uh, } probably around here people fish for bass and crappie and catfish more than anything else.	24
Uh-huh.	4
How old are your kids?	39
Yeah.	15
<Laughter>.	20
{F Oh, } that's exciting.	21
-- {C and } I just feel much better.	24
Do you have major medical benefits?	7
[ Of, + of ] course, I find now that I spend more time with my grandchildren in -- -- detail.	24
<Popping>  I think they are starting probably in the first grade.	24
{F Uh, } I'm just working a couple days a month,	24
{C so } he'll be able to give them the maximum sentence, in some cases there.	9
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] [ even, + even ]  in our home towns there's a lot of -- -- {F um, } public service things  that they could do -- -- {F uh, } {D you know, } drug rehabilitation [ and +  -- -- and ] alcohol [ and, + and ] just, {F uh, }  helping old people, and, {F um, } {F uh, } {D you know, }  helping cripple, just helping somebody else --	9
Didn't like it?	8
No,	33
Yes.	15
Yeah,	15
{F Uh, } that's nice.	21
I'm from Maryland.	24
{F Huh. }	26
Oh.	29
{F Oh, } we think it is, so funny.	11
That's an excellent movie.	9
{C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } we could go to both places without having to spend so  much for -- -- plane fare.	24
Uh-huh.	15
You knew who was bad.	24
I haven't been over, {F uh, } to a dealer to look at them although I did see something in tonight's paper that said that their, {F uh } reliability is rated to be equal to that of [ the, + I guess, the ] Japanese cars.	24
M C I	17
Yes, sir,	36
yeah.	36
I know Kroger will do it,	24
[ [ [  We, + we, ] + {F uh, } we ] worked, + we've worked ] our way back into the  hallway,	24
{C and } it goes real good on dandelions.	24
{C but } I think that was the last time we were really involved,	24
what type of movies do you like?	31
Yeah.	15
{C But } I don't think I could do it.  Because I'm very, very emotional.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And, } {F uh. } -	26
{C and } it tore up the people inside the car.	24
{C and, } [ that +  we were worried that ] they were getting dug in	9
yeah.	26
You get adjusted to the taste.	2
{F Uh, } no,	33
{C And } that place, {D boy, } -	24
{C and, }  {F uh, } maybe they pick up on that.	9
{D Well, } I think for me, -	24
yes.	15
{C so } that's not really my favorite thing to do or anything, but [ I, + I  ] need to do it.	24
Uh-huh.	15
(( no matter what you do ))   about that, {D yeah, } unless you're {D like } a Senior V P or something which I am not <laughter>.	9
{C But } [ that, + {F uh, }  I guess that  ] goes along with the general idea that the federal government [ had to, + ] {F uh, } was expending so much money on defense, {F uh, } [ that, + that ] the [ program now is a, + {F uh, } program now is, ] {F uh, } -	9
no.	33
Yeah,	38
{C And } they have been, -	24
Yeah,	36
She ran off once,	24
Yeah.	36
# [ he's really, + # he's really ] starting to get lots of fun	24
matter of fact # I just saw them last week.	24
[ Except, + {D well } except ] if you're a felon,	24
# Yeah. #	15
Okay,	15
That's right.	36
Uh-huh.	15
I need to do all kinds of different things like that,	24
{C but } there's kind of like [ a little, + a little ] thing sticking out, {F uh, } <laughter> in the Lake Michigan,	24
I know my mother's [ in now, + in ] a unit that's mainly Alzheimer's --	24
huh-uh.	36
-- like you said, I've worked in different places,	24
{C And } you just can't get away from it no matter where you live.	24
{D Actually } I never thought about that,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
Okay,	29
{C but } [ it was int-, + it certainly was ] an exciting Series, anyway.	9
{C and } I'm in Plano.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And, } maybe not, -	40
They've got a lot of special needs	9
{C And so } basically at this point [ I'm, + I'm ] a real walker.	24
{C And } I'm sure that the, {F uh, } driving factor for recycling the computer paper is that we get paid to do so.	9
[ [ [ [ I, + I, know, ] + I, ] + I, ] + I know ] it is getting worse.	9
You too.	38
Uh-huh.	15
No,	33
# Yeah. #	15
that it's, it's really a sad commentary on, uh, you know, a life in general,	9
The idea was that everybody should have an  education so that they would be a better voter	9
{C But, } {F uh, } they're starting to change  that out in the last couple of years, too.	24
{C and } the lawyers can throw people out  for no reason whatsoever just because they want to.	9
{D Well, } that's good.	21
For goodness sakes.	21
{F Uh, } the reason I said that because I've had about, {F uh, } three calls and my daughter had one, too, from different students out of North Carolina.	24
I know my son goes to a private school,	24
What?	14
{C But, }  {F uh, } -	26
Sure.	36
I don't think so.	36
# It did.  #	21
yeah,	36
{C so } <laughter>. Might as well start now, {F huh? }  <Laughter>.	9
{C but } I signed up for this before I did.	24
No,	32
They don't, {F uh, } {F uh, } encompass, {F uh, } many handcrafts like knitting and that kind of thing.	24
{D So. } -	26
Yeah.	15
# {C but, } I # didn't really talk about that with her.	24
Yeah.	26
{C And } my wife, of course, thinks I'm crazy, which I may be too	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	36
# By then, # -	9
{D Well, } {F uh, } a friend of mine actually works for McDonald Douglas  [ in the, + {F uh, } in the  ] space station program	24
things are getting rough out there,	9
{E Excuse me, } go ahead.	18
{F Oh, } you do, {F huh. }	21
I always thought it'd be great to have twins.	24
right,	15
Two and half, {F oh. }	30
I'd like to go to Sundance and  Park City -- -- and some of those.	24
[ it, + it,  ] -	26
{D Well, } I've got a step-daughter,	24
{C and } it's something to think about,	9
{C And then } I have one that, {F uh, } just gave me the pin number automatically.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C Plus } he eats, -	24
{C because } [ it's a big, + {D you know, } Dallas area is a big ] metropolitan area.	24
Yeah.	15
{C so, } I'm going to wait on those.	24
{C but } [ I'm, + I'm ] in New York	24
{C so } she would make these fancy casseroles and hide it in there, {D you know, }	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yes.	15
The only, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
I think it's just going to take a little bit longer.	9
{C and } they charge to ski on it.	24
{C But } I, {D you know, } drove a tractor,  helped them weed beets and that sort of thing.	24
Uh-huh.	15
# Yes.  #	15
I didn't know what to expect.	24
{F Uh, } the one that I picked is more similar in format to the newspaper,	24
{F oh, } yeah,	15
<Child_talking>.	20
dents in the  (( hole )) ,	24
{F Uh, } there used to be, fact, I think there still is, [ the, + {F uh, } the ] DAILY NEWS which runs out of the San Fernando Valley	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } they didn't have any coverage under my name	24
[ {C but, } + {C but } ] the other side to that is, if you put him in prison for life, there's a chance that he might do things in prison, [ or, + ] {D you know, } and somehow redeem himself.	9
I think it went out twice in two years	24
Much like what Roger Staubach did.	24
{C but } {D you know } I guess to some people it'd almost be better to die to them than to spend life in prison or whatever [ I don't + {E I mean } I don't know ]	9
Right.	15
yeah,	15
You probably, -	9
{C but } all I can do is hear about, -	24
yeah,	15
yeah,	15
Anyway, {D well } the question is, {D you know, } do you think, [ i-, + it ]  does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime	7
yeah.	36
{D well } I'm not into quilting	24
Okay.	15
I think they do really play much better as a team than they do, {F uh, } {F uh, } each one, {D you know, } individually at their spot <<pause>>.	9
Right.	15
{D Well, } I'm sure you probably are.	21
{F Um, } one of the women is real active with, {F uh, } Muscular Dystrophy.  And, {F uh, } does a lot [ of, + of ] work with them on a volunteer basis	24
Yeah	15
Uh-huh.	15
[ Our, +  our ] insurance  [ is, + {F uh, } is ] doing something similar where they're also going <throat_clearing> to mor-, -	24
Uh, well part of it, touring.	24
Yeah.	36
{D Now, } they have a lot of bass tournaments.	24
<Laughter>.	20
{F Uh, } whether it's, -	26
It seems like it's been a while.	11
yeah.	36
Sure,	36
{D You know, } that second group of people falls into the group that I say give up their rights,	9
{C But } maybe when the boys get a little older, we'll do some more planting,	24
{F Uh, } {C and so } [ I, +  {D you # know } I, # ] -	26
{D Well } [ I don't  think, + {D you know, } I don't think ] that, if I was the criminal, that I would like the judge passing sentence on me.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Why don't you tell me about your choir.	18
Yeah,	15
{C and } [ I went to, + I go to ]  college,	24
I do a lot of training of our customers for new products.	24
[ That's, + that ] was one of my favorite subjects in school was, {F uh } -- -- literature.	24
# [ We're trying, + # we're trying ] to, {F uh, } -	24
My husband and  I had, {F uh, } took a book out of the library about gardening, too, and started a garden, a fall garden.	24
[ It's, +  it's, ] {F uh, } -	26
{F Um, } [ on occasion. + On occasion.  ]	11
That's true.	36
he ought to be able to perform,	9
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } yeah,	21
{D you know, } {C and } ((   )) , I guess I'm going to have to wait for the millennium, I think though because  I [ do, + don't ] think we're going to restore the earth to, -	13
They might be,	34
{C So, }  I've just recently had to start looking at it myself.	24
{C And } I know that there's a glass plant up here,	24
{C But } this one [ was, +  I thought was ] excellent.	24
it's nice.	24
{C and } [ I, + # I'm ] going # to be able to make my own clothes.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } maybe they could pay people for doing this, at least something,	9
my last G M car was a seventy  Chevy station wagon	24
[ I, + we ] used to go there all the time.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } this little rabbit that I made in, {F uh, } tole painting class, {D you know, } is {D like } a welcome.	24
There is kind of a set pattern to it.	24
{C and then } went on down to Disney World,	24
{F Uh,} {C and} if not,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Okay.	15
when you get to be thirty something and thirty something gets to be a little bit older <laughter> -- -- you start, {F um, } -	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } I get that, it has recipes in it,	24
Yeah,	36
<Beep> Okay, {F uh, }	13
Sure.	15
Really was pretty nice.	24
# {F Huh } # .  <<faintly>>	15
-- {C and } if you're still capable  of driving and doing those things, then you feel like, {D well, } gee, [ I'm, +   {D you know, } I'm ] isolating myself -- -- here for no reason at the moment.	9
{C So } you haven't really, {F uh, } dealt with that in a sense.	22
I guess I push the lawn mower around	24
{C And } my wife and I these days are especially into opera.	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
Yeah,	15
the snowbirds were the, -	24
{F Uh, }	26
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } I have [ [ a, + a, ] + a ]  brother lives in Indianapolis, a sister lives in Chicago,  and my folks live back in Buffalo, New York.	24
{C and } you say, {D well, } I made it though, at least it's mine.	18
did that have, -	7
Yeah,	15
{F Oh, } [ I haven't, +  I didn't ] hear that was coming out.	7
at least where you  ((   )) . -	26
Wow.	21
{C and, } -	26
They were young men.	24
Right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C And }  that's not, -	9
they don't ever learn their name.	24
{D Well. } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
when my kids were real little  and I was home, I watched, -	24
that's an everyday occurrence.	24
{C and } some communities are trying to do that now.	24
{C But, } {F uh, } even now, [ I would, + I would  ] like to not have to work in some ways.	24
Uh-huh.	15
I think our next car will be a, you know, some big old four door, uh, something that can haul the kids to baseball practice -- -- and piano lessons,	9
{C and } I'm sure it will be, {D you know, } quite a few people are affected by that	9
[ That, + That's ] wonderful.	21
Yeah.	15
# uh-huh. #	15
I go, yeah,	24
Okay.	29
Uh-huh.	15
it was a little, {F uh, } -	24
You wonder about that sometimes.	24
It was just crazy enough for th-, -	9
-- {C but } I think I'm not sure  if it's by law just,	24
[ {C but, } + {C and } ] they're expensive	9
I know a lot of [ their, +  {F oh, } their ] countries that they had overtaken, or  wanted to be independent or  several of them, right,	7
{C And } if they can test the teachers, that gives them the full right to test the kids.	9
that's, -	26
[ {C so, } + # {C so } ] I # was thinking there's this Beef Bourguignonne recipe that I've tried before that's pretty good	24
{F uh, } I think [ it's, + it's ] the image that the  woman has and, {F uh, } in the world, as, {F uh, } the lesser of the two.	9
[ [ {C A-, } + {C an-, } ] + {C and } ]  [ that's been tried, +  that was tried ] in Alabama too,	24
Uh-huh.	15
I need to balance my checking account,	24
[ They + the ] electric chair	9
{C And, } -	26
You say have your four year old taking lessons already?	8
pushing keys certain times and, {F Uh, } messing up your files and things like that.	22
Uh-huh.	36
Yeah.	15
{D Actually, } I'm in, -	26
{F Um. }	15
{D You know, } {C because } other states quite a bi-,  a chunk out for, {F uh, } city  and  state taxes	24
{C And } they had talked about having a thing like, one Saturday a month, you could come and  drop your aluminum cans off from home, {D you know, }	24
{F Um. }	15
Uh-huh.	15
# {F Uh, } # now that Randall's coming back next season, I hope they'll [ be, + do ] a little bit better.	24
Mine was two in December <laughter>.	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } my father wasn't using it,    *[[slash error]] She  ((   ))  took it with her,    *[[sd]] because she needed it to do, -	24
-- {C but, } {F uh, } it's a little tough because that's when I'm usually making dinner and the kids are wanting to talk all at the same time.	24
<Laughter> Schnauzers, in particular probably.	9
what do they do then.	9
They are good.	24
[ are you, + are you ] in Dallas?	7
{F Oh, } really?	12
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
[ [ I don't, +  I'm, ] +  know ] -	24
{C and } I signed up for class because then again, you [ get, + {D you know, } get ] someone to guide you	24
{C so } I really had mixture of suburb, # and # urban living.	24
{C and } I've been watching, {F uh, } -	26
{C and } it managed  to get up to about fifty this afternoon	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ we, +  he ] wanted to get into a Mennonite nursing home which is very popular and hard to get into and had {D like } a ten year waiting list --	24
No.	33
Yes. That's what, -	15
{D you know, } [ the, + those  ] were all brothers and sisters a lot -	24
{F Um, }  {F oh, } there was another one,	17
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
This guy's place burned down,	24
Have you?	7
{C and } secondly, when we have enough schools, sometimes we can't get [ the, + the ] support for the teachers that we need to pay them to keep good teachers.	9
{C But } [ it's, + it's ] got to have a point to it.	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C And } you pour the beer over the top of it,	18
{F Oh, } really?	12
Yes,	15
{C and, } {D you know, } life ends there	9
{C and } I don't think there's a change between one party than the other.	9
Yeah,	15
I showed you that one too didn't I?	7
a lot of people don't think it would be a deterrent, {F uh, } [ to, + to ] future crime,	9
Yeah.	15
<Laughter>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
<Laughter> <child_talking> I'm telling you, go one way or the other.	18
{F Uh, } {D you know, } -	15
recently seven months	24
# {C And } # in the major leagues, I guess there is a couple of different divisions	24
[ [ It's, +   it's daughter, ] +  it's his daughter ] that, -	24
Oh.	15
Uh-huh,	15
Okay.	15
{E I mean, } I, -	26
-- {C so } I don't know how they expect them to, {F uh, } pass history when they can't read anything,  {D you know, } even read a word problem in math.	24
we'll just taking them up there and put them in the bins anyway.	24
<laughter>.	20
All right.	29
I mean, you know, if I was setting up a daycare, there would be so many needs you would have to #customize# -- -- your service to.	9
Yeah.	15
{F Uh, } yes,	4
Can't get it from mosquitoes.	25
{C But } [ I don't know, +  I don't know ]  if I'm going to go, -	26
<Noise> {F Uh, } I basically, {F uh, } listen to the news from the T V.	24
That is crime where they videoed.	24
yeah.	15
I've been to Oklahoma,	24
{C And, } {F uh, } I'm going to get back [ most of what I earned, + {E I mean } most of what I pay ] in taxes	24
I am surprised they would bring anything over here.	9
{F Uh, } probably [ m-, + less ] so now than it was ten years ago or whatever	9
{D well } nice to talk to you.	38
Uh-huh,	15
{C And } especially in the winter.  {E I mean, } you [ g-, + ]  get up in the dark and come home in the dark <laughter> {D you know. }	24
I see.	29
# {F Huh. } #	15
<Laughter> Unfortunately we don't have any animals,	24
I need to go,	24
{C and } I think, if somebody else were to play that, {D you know, } [ they wouldn't, + [ [ they, + nobody, ] + everybody ] would ] think, that's lousy,	9
[ {C so, } +  {C but } ] [ I, +  I ]  love mine,	24
{C or } is he a -- -- problem child.	24
Okay.	29
{C So, }  {E I mean, } are you, in terms of other things, [ like, +   like, ] not running, but playing a little bit of tennis,  [ or + ] can you not do stuff like that at all?	7
{C So } we're -- -- spend a lot of time on the house and out in the yard and things.  But. {F Um, } like to keep up to date too.	24
a [ s-, + ] {D you know, } pop,	24
{D Well, } do you like to camp, those kind of trips?	7
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } [ did you, + {F uh, } since you were paid for school yourself, do you  ] think you had a different outlook on it, like your grades and things like  that?	7
Uh-huh.	15
I don't know,	19
Yeah,	15
I'm just kind of surprised we did that.	9
Right.	36
Uh-huh,	15
# Uh, oh.  #	21
# Pianos, # uh-huh.	30
{D Well, } do you all have a, -	7
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } that's a pretty good engineering school, I think.	9
# Uh-huh. #	15
All right,	15
I don't ever remember, of course, {D you know, } you only remember the good stuff,	24
{F Oh, } absolutely.	21
{C So } [ do you, + what do you  ] think is good about the schools?	39
{C But } I think that, {F uh, } [ all, + with all ]  the perks that we've given them, -	9
Huh-uh, {D you know. }	36
{D like, } {F uh, } did you ever see, this is going way back, {F uh, } JAGGED EDGE.	8
nor am I.	24
We've taken a lot of trips with our kids when they were younger.	24
{C But } that would probably bother me to wake up <noise>  one day and find out halfway through the day that you're going to be drug tested  and you didn't know about it.	24
Yes	15
Right,	36
we sort of take care of the kids when they were school   and [ they, + they ] got through school.	24
{D Well, } I think we've probably, -	9
{C And } maybe there aren't, {D you know, } <laughter>.	9
that was one thing I thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way.	9
{C and } I really enjoyed that	24
very personal.	9
I assume so.	8
Good.	21
# {D You know, } # one parent go one direction	9
{D So, } who's your favorite team?	39
[ I, + I, ] -	26
Uh-huh.  {F Um, }	15
Yeah.	15
Right,	36
Yeah.	15
Wow.	21
{E I mean }  there's not a dent on the outside body,	24
[   If, + if ] -	26
{C But } to use force, {F uh, } <swallowing> [ really sets us a, a, i-, i-, + ] essentially says that [ your body, + ] there's a title to your body and that title belongs to the government.	9
{C and } [ they, + they've ] been in day care since, {D you know, } -	24
I think that's one of the most, {F uh, } enjoyable things about being up here.	9
[ {C and } it's been, + {F um, } <lipsmack> {C and } it's been ] pretty rainy -- -- looking.	24
{D Well, } I guess I better go.	38
<Lipsmack> {C So } [ I, + I ] would hate to have that <breathing> responsibility just personally	24
{C and } it had to be matching	24
No intelligent person can say that we could spend our way rich.	9
they're,  {F uh, } wood shake.	24
[ Once, + once ] I got them all through  college, {F uh, } it came to the point where, {F uh, } -	24
{F Uh, } yeah.	4
Yep.	15
# Uh-huh. #	15
{D Well, } we've been here since sixty-six.	24
{C but, } I realize the difference,	24
{F Oh } yeah.	15
# That's what we have, too. #	24
They're really looking for a lot more men to participate.	24
[ hasn't, + has ] the N F L draft even gone yet?	7
{F Oh, } I think that's, marvelous.	24
Well, the, they don't want to spend the time	9
really in fact  [ they're, + they're  ] releasing people, {F uh, } that are in there for, {D you know, } not major crimes, but, {F uh } robberies and assault and things like  that,	9
Hi,	6
{C So } [ it, + # it ] really [ wasn't # too, +   wasn't too ] pleasant <laughter>.	9
the last one we saw was THELMA AND LOUISE.	24
those are actually areas that are hit pretty hard, I would think.	9
they do not have it in Europe, as I understand.	9
{D well, } {D actually, } like I say,  it ain't as bad this time, because I was in shape when I got pregnant.	24
Not  (( quite ))  <laughter>.	32
Do you consider these serious, {F uh, } problems?	7
{C but } if the time came, it'd be real nervous.	9
{D Well } that takes all the work out of it.	9
And in the short run probably <laughter>, too.	9
There I could barely make a couple of miles <laughter>.	24
There we are.	24
I haven't either.	24
{D Well, } [ I think, + I think ] we're okay.	9
{C but } everybody perceived him that way, and stuff --	9
{C But } it went up to, I don't know, nine or ten.	24
{F Oh, } no.	21
{F oh, } yeah,	15
How old were they when you adopted?	39
-- I'm not sure,	24
{D Well, } you have to put eggs and everything, don't you.	7
It costs less than the other,	24
{F Oh, } yes.	36
# Uh-huh. #	15
{C And, } yeah,	36
Uh, no.	33
we have two big dogs in  the backyard, and always kind of thought that too, #  kind of an extra buffer. #	24
[ I'm, +  I'm ] sort of an acting process engineer.	24
No <laughter>.	33
{F Um, } <beep> yes and no.	34
<laughter>.  [ {C And, } + {C and, } ]  {F uh, } my choice of graduate schools [ was, + ]  {F uh, } {D you know, } it changed a whole lot.	24
{C And } that creates family tensions.	9
{D Well, } we have all kinds of fast foods everywhere  around --	24
Yeah.	15
I just sent it back in,	24
{C So } my kids can be in day care for a few hours a week,	24
{C and } I really think we should have more -- -- political leaders in the women than we do [ up for, + and even for ] President and Vice President this year,	9
{C And } those operating systems have to change	9
[ {C And, } +  {C and } ] that's been done.	24
I -- -- think it's more [ an in-, + a ] burden [ to, + to ]  provide for.	9
{E # I # mean } they're not helping anybody.	9
{C and } a few people I guess will  make a few people pretty wealthy in construction and so forth.	9
it just seems that, -	26
{C So } she was at school out here?	7
Yeah,	36
I think,	24
{C and } -- -- we keep encouraging him to keep an open mind.	24
As far as [ ge-, + {D yeah, } getting ] doctors and all that stuff, yeah.	2
{C and, } {F uh, } -	26
I guess I'm too protective,	9
yeah.	15
{C and } it's -	26
# {F Uh, } # {D Well, } [ I, + I ] was.	38
That's, a lot of money that you went to buy this item.	9
{C And } they had until the fifteenth of April to come up some formula that would be more equitable to different districts according to finances, because the poor districts were getting less money, so not as good an education.	24
{D You know, } just yesterday, though,  I saw a girl in the  (( spine ))  out here at Lewisville that had on a pair of shorts.	24
All right,  {F uh, } {D well, }	13
yeah.	15
{C and } you take one that's used to being, {F uh, } busy [ being, + having ] something to do all the time, it makes a big difference.	9
Yeah,	36
-- {C but } there's {D like } two fellows from, {F uh, } Brooklyn,	24
I thought, [ Kathy's, + it's Kathy ] (( Kester ))  <laughter>.	24
I've never seen any of those.	24
<laughter>	20
Have you been involved on the Switchboard long?	7
Right.	15
{F Uh. }	26
Uh-huh.	15
yeah,	36
#Uh-huh.#	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } I feel that the Japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our, {F uh, } car manufacturers have for a while.	9
Bases are pretty safe because they check your I D on your way in.	24
[ We have, + We have ] just a bunch of people,	24
I do work.	24
Okay,	15
{C And } how much shrimp would you use?	39
{C And } I thought, {D well } she doesn't know me or my children from anything.	24
[ [ I, + I ] didn't, + # I didn't ] even like the previews on that.	24
{C and then } you do it by mail-order.	24
That was about [ a, + the ] Interior Minister,	24
<laughter> that's why I have so many different levels of P C -s around at the moment.	24
{F Uh, } yeah.	4
{F Oh, } okay,	15
They go through just a continuous thing on the printer --	24
{C And } that's, {F uh, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
I have, {F uh, } {F uh, } {D you know, } a real problem, {F uh, }	24
{C But } she goes in the senior citizen center.	24
{C but } fortunately the home owner's  association does all that.	24
I see it here at T I.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } you'll probably really, {F uh, } [ re-, + regain ] your enthusiasm for it -- -- once you get into [ a, + a ] class again.	24
Uh-huh,	15
Bye-bye.	38
uh-huh.	15
{C so, } {F uh, } to do a whole lot just requires a lot of, {F oh, } coordination as far as -- -- scheduling and -- -- that type of, {F uh, } deal, {D you know, } {F uh, }	24
[ it was, + it was ] more like, {F um, } a headquarters -- -- or something, anyway, where [ they, + they ] staffed it three shifts a day so that [ someone, + if they needed someone, ] they could ring	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
{C or, } -	26
{F Uh, } {C but } I think in general <squeak>  it's probably good.	9
[ Are you, + do you ] work,	7
I don't know if it's any different than other companies,	24
{C But } there's [ no, + {D you know, } nothing ] else <laughter> to keep it going.	24
Uh-huh.	15
We saw, {F um, }  HEROES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN COWBOYS, tonight.	24
{C or } it will just <baby_crying> totally get even more out of control	9
All rightie.	38
{F Uh, } I guess our minds are so,  {F uh, } {F uh, } {A what is it? }  {F Uh, } finite --	9
{D Well, } I've only been playing {D like } about three years now.	24
{C and } some, # people # don't even own a car and know how to drive a car.	9
bye.	38
<<Very faint>> Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } he'll be delighted.	9
I think there really is.	9
those two.	9
Yeah,	36
I guess dado joints is what it's called.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
I figure all our C Ds that we have what I really like <laughter>.	24
<Laughter>  It was nice,	24
{F Um. }	26
{C But } he's a turtle fanatic.	24
{F Oh, } really?	12
{C and } I really got into that habit for a while,	24
{C But, } {F uh, } -	15
{C But, } {F uh, } right now it's kind of a difficult time,	24
{C and } [ you weren't really even, + {F um, } they didn't ] expect you to choose any sort of major or anything at all until you were in your second year,	24
you have to cut each  thing or, {D you know, } use the melon baller and stuff	9
[ I suspect you, + I suspect you ] have.	24
usually I try [ to, + to ] find something long <breathing>  that, # I'm # going to, -	24
{E I mean } everybody's doing it so it isn't -- -- like, {F uh, } private business has  had to do it	9
[ it's, + you get ] somebody where you kind of know the family already.	9
my name is Pat Johnson	6
Right.	15
{C And } [ [ you, + you ] didn't, + you didn't ] have to lock your door.	24
{C and } are we getting what we pay for?	7
{C but, } {F uh, } [ the, + the, ] {F uh, } basic point of heavy metal [ w-, + which ] seems to be music to annoy you, [ is, + {F uh, } gets ] a little annoying.	9
{D You know, } {C and } I'm like -	26
(( Kalli )) , K A L L I?	7
The other thing they asked about was whether {F uh, } {F uh, } the verdict should be required to be unanimous. Which, again, I think is the way it is now. That [ all the, + all ] verdicts, -	24
{C And } [ they just, + I've noticed that they do it just ]  with subtle little words, {F uh, } usually, {F uh, }  just  that sway the whole, {F uh, } report [ that, + ] {D you know, } by just a couple of words.	9
{C And } it reduces some of the length of the benefits, [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] I don't know besides that.	24
{F uh, } we were across from that big bus station,	24
Yeah,	15
Yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } there was hardly any wear to them.	24
{F Uh, } {D well } for a dinner party, I think one of my favorite things is baked chicken and white wine.	24
Like an attachment	8
{C And so, } {F uh, } {D now }  (( I do, ))  with the COSBY SHOW,	26
{C And } it was all about women searching for themselves.    *[[two utts?]] And, {F um, } <lipsmack>  {D you know, } a lot of <laughter>  hanky-panky, # going # on.	24
Also somewhat ((   ))  is to collect owed to the government from various loan programs that people have borrowed.	9
uh-huh.	15
thank you.	38
{F Oh } really.	12
{C and } we came up here,	24
{C and, } {F uh, } in fact my brother still does a lot of skiing.	24
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } do you.	12
Yeah,	15
Probably.	36
I think the entire baseball, -	9
First question,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } they got a new mix of kids this time.	24
How much, [ da-, + ] like,  the caught being good slips. -	26
You do feel like you've gone out, {D you know, } and done something, # when you go to # a French restaurant, or a restaurant downtown.	24
# {D Well } # -- -- it sounds like you've had some good experiences with that --	9
{F Oh, } shoot,	21
I think at this time, we're just in [ a, + a ]  rebuilding type of phase, {D you know. }	9
-- # [ they kept doing, + # they kept putting off doing ] that.	9
{C And } he was treated like he had five fathers # or something. #	24
{C Because } I always think the  mail never comes on these days	24
{C And then } you,  {F uh, } mix flour and  a cup of water, maybe, {F uh, } one tablespoon of flour and a cup of water.	18
{F Oh, }	15
<Laughter>.	20
with the psychic and everything?	8
-- {C and } you have to have the color for that particular school [ if you, + if you ] choose to participate in -- -- spirit week.	24
I was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff.	24
at least you guys have a remote control.	24
{C but } the courts are so backlogged right now  it takes forever just to go to trial.	9
Right.	15
{C but } it blew a head gasket.	24
{C And } it seems as though we are, {F uh, }  giving the criminal the benefit, more than the victim.	9
# {C But } [ what they, + # {D well, } what they ] do is, is they say, {D well } it's going to cost, {D you know, } twenty dollars for tests and forty dollars for this	24
{C so } we need [ to, + to ]  build on something more positive than that.	9
{C and } he definitely has a very different slant on the news.	24
-- {C and } I think we took it  especially just during the war to kind of catch up on everything and -- -- have it be digested.	24
I think health care is probably [ [ the, +  the  most  pressing -- ] + -- {F uh, } the pressing ] one,	9
we come out [ a lit-, + even a little ] bit ahead because we've been able to use whatever, # first off, and then pay # -- -- for it later.	24
{C So } I assume that probably the total [ cove-, + cost ] is probably, three fifty to four hundred.	24
{C and }  [ if you, + I guess if you ] keep [ trad-, +  changing ] them out you can keep a car for a long time.	9
{D Well } what do you think have been the most significant changes in the past generation or so?	39
especially when you're like us and  don't really want to do it anyway.	9
{D Well, } {D you know, } they're always there for you	9
Uh-huh.	15
you probably have rye grass up there.	9
{F Uh, } {D you know, } I've been teaching since they were, gosh, newborns	24
{D Now } I don't know, what they do in place of it.	24
I didn't have, {D well, } much of a problem	24
<Breathing>.	20
Yes.	15
We're planning a  trip, just he and I.	24
-- {F uh, } I'm originally from the State of Virginia -- -- and, {F uh, } lived [ near, + near  ] Virginia Beach where we could, {F uh, } surf cast and, {F uh } -- -- catch a lot of things in the ocean there.	24
It was like we can't take it back	24
Right?	7
I've had # interesting conversations on several subjects [ not, + {F uh, } not  ] just this but [ different, +  the different  ] -- -- things.	38
{C And } you do, obviously, have enough to live on	24
I guess that's what they need for their machines to get everything down pat,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C because } when people can't pay,  they end up going to clinics or, {D you know, } to public hospitals, and that kind of thing,	9
Yeah,	36
Right.	15
Yeah,	36
{F Uh, } yeah,	4
{C and } I really enjoy it	24
{C so } [ it's, +  it's ] very interesting.	9
Uh-huh.	36
Uh-huh.	15
it really concerns me, that, {F um, } first of all, that anyone could let someone live like that,	9
however the need for that -- -- kind of car has changed now,	24
{C and } close to that, what's called Duck Creek that runs through part of Garland,  that's the part that always seems to get hardest hit when [ there's, + there's ] the hard rain.	24
{C and so, } we very seldom get  together to walk	24
Oh, yeah,	15
and, and they had a description of the exact problem we were experiencing that apparently was a programming error -- -- in the, uh, computer control unit,	24
Yeah,	36
Yeah,	15
I had someone tell me that, I will never register to vote because I don't want to serve on a jury <laughter>.	24
Yeah.	15
{C so. } -	26
{D like, } I have a  friend that's in the air conditioning heating business --	24
Right.	36
They make it to the playoffs it seems for the last few years	24
{C but, } <sigh> {F uh, }  a couple of them [ we've lost to, + <sigh> {A the, [ w-, + weren't ] too good trees, } we've lost to wind, ]  # {F uh, } {F uh. } #	24
Yeah.	15
[ {C so, } + {C and } ] he chews on plants and all that,	24
Uh-huh <laughter>.	15
Yeah,	15
{F Oh, } I see.	29
it's like Europe.	24
# You don't spend it. #	24
I don't know if they could possibly teach a machine to recognize all the different accents.	24
{D Well, } {D see } -	26
Yeah <laughter>.	15
{C But, } {F uh. } -	26
yeah.	15
{D You know, }  we just don't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in Dallas --	24
{C so } what, {F uh, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
Okay.	29
of course, in Nicaragua and around there with the Sandinistas and the Contras, that's been going on for years.	24
{C So } he's been impressed with all the Honda cars.	24
-- {C but } then we started watching it.	24
{C but } now that you just mentioned that. -	24
I can't imagine.	21
I put in pepper plants this weekend.	24
yeah,	36
Right.	36
yeah.	26
Uh-huh.	15
[ I would, + I think ] probably not [ a, + a ] brand new car,	24
{F Uh, } there was a retired plumber that went to, {F uh, } {F uh, } Uruguay I think and  helped them quite a bit with concepts in plumbing, {D you know, }  providing [ for a, + for ] better public hygiene.	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
{D Well. } -	26
-- I could actually find something I could  cook real easy that would be [ kind of + sort of ] elegant -- -- kind of <laughter>.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C so } it's between tennis [ and, + and ] bowling.	24
It's kind of nice to know that they're  just going to be seeing, {D you know, } not a lot of violence and that kind of stuff --	9
[ {C so, } +  {C but } ] [ he, +  he's ]  real unusual in that, {F uh, }	24
she's only used it one time	24
Yeah,	4
<Laughter> {D Well, } that sounds like kind of an important job to be, {F uh, } straight on.	9
# Yeah. #	15
{D So, } -	26
{C and } ours were in mils.	24
In Plano.	24
Mama, I've seen it <laughter>.	25
my husband and I, we're twenty-eight,  [ if we lived our lives and didn't become, {D you know, } indebted, like {D you know, }  our generation before us, [ that, + ] {F um, } the budget would balance. And that we became accustomed to living with what we could afford, which we wouldn't be destitute,	24
{C and then }  I went to see that,	24
All right, do you do exercise?	7
I guess we have the longest, {F uh, } running inmates for death row # too. #	24
Yeah,	36
{C And } it was so frightening	24
Just pets,	15
Right.	36
A gun is a gun to them.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C But } [ he, + he ] limits it pretty good.	24
Really.	15
Right.	15
# Okay. #	29
Oh <laughter>.	15
{C But, }  again,  to require, {D you know, } such a test [ and  jus-, + and then ] to [ make, + make ] it  ((   ))   is to subject them [ to, + to ] [ discrimi-, + discriminatory ] practices and other things.	9
{E I mean, } [ it, + it'll ] tow three thousand pounds	24
I guess I would tend myself to be more towards [ the, + the, ] {D like } three, where I don't think you should necessarily ban guns [ any, + by any ] means,	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C Bu-, } {C so } [ they really are, +   they really pick up ] things.	9
they don't consider water a food --	9
Sounds like something she would write.	9
<Throat_clearing> Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
I really, -	15
[ I, + I ] agree	36
Yeah.	15
That would be nice.	36
Okay	15
it's not quite as nice for a little bit less.	24
# Right.	36
{C And so } [ I, + I ] feel like,  number one, [ you ne-, + you also need ]  to see what kind of name the, -	24
It was so funny and it sounds like, {F uh, } what you were just describing, SOAPDISH, too.	9
sure,	15
It seems to be doing much more damage and affecting [ much more pe-, + many more people ] than AIDS.	24
{C and } I don't know how they sort that.	24
{C and }  we went and looked at used cars around town.	24
Yeah.	36
{D Well, } you'll, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{D you know, } I am sort of [ [ a, + a, ] + an ] advocate [ [ [ of, + of, ] + {F uh, } of  letting people, ] + of having ] free speech	24
That's true.	36
{D Well, } I think they can turn off the T V for one thing. [ And, + and ] go out and do stuff, {D you know. }	9
Do you?	12
<Baby_talking>.	20
<Sniffing>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
{C And, }  {F uh, } sailing [ was, +  was ]  kind of nice to learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against [ the, +  the ] wind, as it were, tacking back and forth	24
{F Uh, }	26
[ [ That, + that,  ] + that's  ] boring for me.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } if you get one of these mats. {D You know, } go to a store,  they normally have these exercise, things, these A B C -s of physical fitness on them.	24
What?	14
-- {C and } we have to pay that price,	9
{E I mean, }  I've read that is a theory.	24
Skidding control,	30
-- people were sending, -	24
I, you know, Florida doesn't seem to be, at least maybe Miami, -	9
[ {C and then, } + {C and then } ] taking [ those, + those ] qualities, and then applying, in the styles, [ that are really, + {F um, } that are ] extremely enjoyable, and then taking, -	24
I can't remember.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Part of it is that, {F uh, } I think we need to be very selective about the kinds of things that come to us on a subliminal basis	9
-- as a matter of fact [ this is a, + {F uh, } this   particular community that I live in is ] very wooded.	24
{C and } [ wi-, + ] there, right outside [ the, + that ]  place where the garbage can is we have the bag for the newspapers,	24
if -- -	26
Sure,	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C but }  it's the only,  {F uh, } -	26
{F Oh, } how nice.	21
That, -	26
{C and then } you just go in whenever you can.	24
{C But } {D anyway, } at least she can go	24
{C And } that would keep you going.	9
# Is it? #	12
my father was telling me about some program he read about where [ you buy your bags, + {D like } you buy your garbage bag ] from the city,	24
one of the [ wom-, + women ] that I work for is married to an Iranian,	24
In fact, it was called Humpty Dumpty Play School or something,	24
yeah,	15
{D Well, } I do feel [ like, + a little bit like, ] -	9
{F Oh, } # yeah. #	15
{C but, } -	26
{C and } sometimes those people  [ are, +  are ] young enough, they can still get out and cause a lot of trouble.	9
Do you live in a real small town [ or, + or ] out in the country?	7
{D See } [ [ I, +  I never, ] +   I ] don't even know what day care is really all about  because [ I, +  I ] never went to a day care center,	24
{D So, } how is the weather out there?	39
Yeah	15
{C and } I saw neither one of them	24
{C so } hopefully this year he'll have one.	24
{C but, } {F uh, } I think, {D you know, } financially, I am, -	24
{C and } it's a ridiculous difference when you start reading from their perspective.	24
Yeah,	15
She's talked to two students.	24
Yeah,	15
{C But, } {F um, } it seems like [ people  just, +  {D you know, } they just ] think, {D well, } I can just have anything I want.	9
That's, -	26
[ I'm, + {F uh, } in fact, I'm ] working the night because of the cutbacks and everything.	24
I think that the space program has done a lot of good for the country.	9
but you tell me to name, you know, five continents	24
{F Um, } that's interesting,	21
don't they?	23
A friend of mine gave me a clock kit --	24
God help those people who have to float  checks occasionally -- -- because you won't be able to with that.	24
Oh.	15
Yeah,	15
{C and, } {F uh, } it's, -	26
it just amazing,	26
yeah,	36
Yes.	15
[ the other, + the other ]  thing [ that + that ] we've found that helps is, {D you know, } we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit --	24
Uh-huh.	15
-- it was a bad, rainy, dark, dreary day,	24
Yeah.	15
{C so, } -	26
that's, {F uh, } what we do to, -	24
Of course, it means that I don't have to cook.	24
Or what you read.	24
-- at least something cooler, -	9
[ {C and } + {F uh, } {C and } ] it was somebody from, {F um, } oh what was it, the, {F uh, } Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints,	24
{C So } that's why we have to work real hard when we get a concert together.	24
# Right. #	15
{C so } that was, -	26
Right.	36
{C and so } [ it's, + ] {D you know, } if I only looked at one of them I [ would have a different perspect-, + clearly would have a different perspective ] on the world.	9
The stores around here don't let  you do it too much.	24
[ that, + that,  ] -	26
Texas.	24
[ Thr-, +  [ f-, +  for ] three ] years.	11
Uh-huh.	15
Because # -- -- # there's always more things # to do.	24
Yeah,	15
I think I'm going to have to keep that in mind for my future because I hope [ to <lipsmack> have + to have ] lots of dinner parties <laughter> <breathing> Cause I like to -	24
Uh-huh.	15
I do too.	24
# {C And, }  # {F uh, } [ h-, + {F uh, } he ]  works over in Maryland <swallowing>.	24
# Right # now [ I, +  I'm ]  in the mode of trying to dig out of debt, I think as everybody is #	9
{C and } I, -	26
{C but } it would make me sick,	24
{C But } go ahead,	18
Yeah.	15
# If you # -- -- can find, {F uh, } some really nice, clean, {F uh, } campgrounds versus, {F uh, } if you go to state parks, {F uh, } -	24
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] I thought no, {D you know, } because I wouldn't know if that was really a robber or not because it was in broad daylight.	24
There are certain circumstances,	24
{C and } when I do clinic work then I have to, {F uh, } {F uh, } look my best.	24
{F Uh, } to tell you the truth right now it feels kind of comfy to have our mobile home and have it so close to paid for.	5
I think Boston's playing Detroit	24
I guess that's, -	26
I sure will.	38
right.	36
we're going to try it with a kitten and see if her maternal instincts come out.	24
What about you?	31
The spice,	22
[ [ They're, + they're very, ] + they're very, ] {F uh, } not interested.	9
Sometimes I think, {F um, } it's real interesting to look to see how many things that I buy in a grocery store which are not really edible groceries <laughter>.	24
{F Uh, } [ there's quite a few, + {F uh, }  there's a lot  ] of development [ of, + of ] condominiums there on the beach front.	24
This is true, so true.	36
you could interpret it that way.	9
{C and } when the cuts came, three of us got, {F uh, } bounced back,	24
Yeah.	15
{C But } -- -- {F um, } gee, we have so  much going on here because <static> {D you know } this is Dallas,	24
Yeah <laughter>.	15
I don't think they're in a conspiracy.	9
it puts ((   ))  a whole in your money bag,    *[[spelling: hole]]	24
Yes,	26
what do you think are the most important benefits for those working for you, [ other than, + other than ] their present salary?	39
-- {C but } inside the cheese cake,  {F uh, } recipe you put, {F um, } lemon peel and orange peel --	24
{D Well, } it's a good past time, # {D you know. } #	9
Yeah,	36
Right.	15
{C and, } {F uh, } they have all the different plastics separated by those little symbols on the bottom.	24
They're always so funny.	9
{C so, } {D well, } {E I mean } he,  so  it wasn't, -	26
{C and } I follow them like  I follow the Mavericks and like  I follow the Cowboys,	24
Yeah.	15
Sort of like car accidents, # {D you know, } # -	9
{D well, } from New York it probably  doesn't matter,	9
{C so } I went to [ a, + a ] pet shop,	24
we couldn't think of a better time to buy than now.	24
<Noise>.	20
Yeah <laughter>.	36
{C And, } {F uh, } I was, {F uh, }  greatly disappointed, {F uh, } when I did move down to Plano to, {F uh, } find out that  [ the, + {F uh, } the, ] {F uh, } great South Fork Ranch was really only a one bedroom house.	24
I have a cousin who is, {F uh, } -	24
{F Oh, } {C so } they don't go to school.	22
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } really?	12
# {C But } act-, # -	26
{C and } we put in our order.	24
[ They don't, + they don't ] recognize any time difference, do they?	7
[ I, + I ] li-, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
-- {C and then } they have, {F uh, } where the bus picks them up and takes them where they need to go	24
[ {C And, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } yes	26
{F Oh, } uh-huh.	15
{F oh, } yeah,	36
I remember my parents home is drywalled  {A and then they, } {F uh, } almost like a small grade stucco type plastering over the drywall -- -- to give it a textured sort of a look,	24
{C and } now we're up to Proposition a Hundred and fifty or  something like that.	24
{C because } they say they can spot check.	24
{C and then }  it's too late to try to change them around at that point.	9
{F Uh, } the jury, [ it was, + {F uh, } {A let me see, } I think it was ] ten to one on the jury, because they only had to have eleven people  --	24
Yeah.	15
the one I'm interested the most, I guess, myself, {F uh, } would be [ the, + the ] Freons  (( {E I mean } )) , for  (( air cond-, )) -	24
Yeah,	29
# Yeah. #	15
{D Well, } [ they're, + they're ] going to be cutting back so much on just, {D you know, } the number of troops we've got in Europe and the number -- -- of troops we have here.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } she's eighty-six.	24
[ {C and, } +  {C and } ] sometimes you get the long term stuff	24
{D You know, } {E I mean, } {D you know, } [ any, + any ] country that wants to be democratic I'm all for helping them, {D you know, } because [  I, +  I ] understand that, {D you know, } you are looking at the United States as the biggest and longest supporter of that type of government.	9
{D Well, } {D Well, } that is good.	21
That's a really nice area.	9
{C and then } the watermelon, the red [ with the, + with the ] #seeds painted in	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } [ that's, + {D you know, } that's ]  an idea.	21
otherwise, I don't want to know they exist.	24
Are you nuts?	25
[ I, +  I ] have chosen to stay at home, and raise my children.	24
{C but } you pick your favorite section,	9
they call it the Cape Cod of the, {F uh, } # the Midwest #	9
{C but } she just got to the point where [ you could might near, + you could ] almost hear those soaps being echoed in her voice, and that attitude being demonstrated.	24
A-, -	26
I haven't seen them priced anywhere yet,	24
{D So } thank you for calling.	38
{F Oh, } prohibitive.	2
{D Well, } this is a pretty good deal.	9
Another thing I'd definitely <noise> <<dropping pan>> want would be anti-lock brakes.	24
He's almost a teenager <laughter>.	24
{C so } he's going to be <breathing> -	24
Do you have any?	7
That's the way I use them, {F uh } --	24
The, -	26
{F Oh } no,	33
{C and } they've got land set aside for a football stadium if they ever get a N F L team.	24
Yeah,	15
{C And } I would like to know that there are, {D you know, } just a lot of activities, like you said, {D you know, } just putting a plant in a room, # {D You # know. } [ Just makes, + just ] brightens [ [ and, + and, ] + # and ] # [ just makes them,  just a little more active.	9
Uh-huh.	15
I was taught when I was growing up, you know, that, that <laughter>, that real people bought General Motors products,	24
No,	33
Uh-huh.	15
They own the place	24
I'll do those once in a while just -- -- {D you know, } {D like } -- -- at eleven thirty when Love Connection's on -- -- and I can't sleep,	24
{C and } I bought it up there before I moved down here.	24
we're looking at that now,	24
by the time they get there,  they can't read.	24
{C and } I have two cats -- -- and my husband,	24
Yeah.	26
this morning in our paper, [ it, + ] there was an article about somebody who had bought three guns in Virginia because all you have to do is get a driver's license,	24
{D Well, } we, {F uh, } remodeled a bathroom. [ And, + ] which required, {F uh, }  completely repainting the bathroom,	24
Right.	15
Take a lot of chances.	24
# what you can do # is, you can write different places, the Chamber of Commerce, tell them what you're interested in.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	36
Why not go to adults, too?	16
<Laughter> I bet.	21
{E I mean, } you might have problems,	9
((   )) .	13
"Right now I'm taking a class on ettiquesy    *[[ Did she really say ""ettiquesy""?? ]]"	24
Yeah,	15
# For profit # -- -- places, I would really look at them awfully carefully	9
{D well } jeans aren't exactly professional	9
This Honda that I have I bought  used,	24
Uh-huh.	15
I'm just not, -	26
I think they start out young, like in, {F uh, } Girl  Scouts and Boy Scouts <Noise> <<like a video game>> -- -- doing s-, -	9
-- right in the tub,	24
{C and then } the kitchen's kind of [ a, + a  ]  country pink and  country blue,	24
{F Oh, } huh-uh.	15
It was the coldest it's been there ever in January <breathing>,	24
Yeah,	15
{C and } -- -- it's very convenient on afternoons when I want to just get away and sit and think.	24
I've told my wife, that one of the reasons they're doing it is because eventually you'll be able to talk to your computer,	24
[ there's, + there's ] been no emphasis on recycling at all in San Antonio.	24
I want to retire quick.	24
<Beep>. {D So } where was your last vacation?  <laughter>.	39
And I'm, I am concerned a lot about, uh, I'm concerned about, uh, two things.	9
{C and } then they'll ship the parents back	24
{F Oh } yes,	4
No,	36
Yes,	4
I see.	15
Yeah	15
{C and } the jury's  supposed to be notified of criminal records when it comes to sentencing by jury.	24
you're a calcu-,  {D you know }	26
[ It is kind of, + they're kind of  ] off and on it seems like.	24
I work for Texas Instruments --	24
Very few I would imagine.	9
# Uh-huh. #	15
all these, {F uh, } gory movies on  there becomes, {F uh, } just a natural fact of life.	9
{C and, } -	26
{C But, } {F uh, } the Serger really makes it  look professional.	9
{D well, } we're start-up.	25
Uh-huh.	15
I'm in Raleigh, North Carolina.	24
They don't have one of those.	24
# Yeah.  #	15
Yeah,	36
there's been a great deal of difficulty in finding someone to talk to	24
{C And, } [ we've had, + we've had ] cats, (( stay ))  in the house.	24
{C but } I guess [ we, + {F uh, } we're ] kind of stuck with it.	9
Yeah,	15
Right,	36
<laughter>.   *[[slash error]] # Yeah. #    *[[slash error]]	13
That's right.	36
Uh-huh.	15
Yes.	15
{C and } [ I, + I ] think that's probably all right in that they, {D you know, } maybe know what [ the, + the ] norm is -- -- for a particular thing.	9
{C and } it does make a difference.	24
One of the things that I have made time for is, {F uh, } playing softball.	24
{E I mean } it's not just the exercise that's boring and time consuming,	9
# Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	36
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	15
that's okay <laughter>.	27
there, there may be some organized way to do this.	9
I talked to people from, {D well, } [ C-, +   what, Carolina ] now -- -- up in, {F uh, } Boston, and New York,	24
{C so } she brings some money in.	24
We're not vegan vegetarians.	5
I think our elected officials say they are speaking for us	9
Sure,	11
[ I don't, + I don't ] think there can be anymore long range planning.	9
It's never humid or sticky or salty feeling,	24
That's good.	21
Yeah,	15
Was it, {F oh, } good.	21
{F Uh, } I see stuff in craft galleries for five hundred dollars	24
I've had a variety of different jobs with [ a + ] various types, {F uh, } in the computer field.	24
I haven't had any actual real life experience	24
{C So } if you have [ a, + a ] dinner party and you're going to serve, {F uh, } seafood for supper, what type of, {F uh, } hors d'oeuvres would you serve prior to the meal?	39
you can compare just about [ everyth-, + thing ] to Japan	9
[ Are, +  are ] you married?	7
That's true.	36
{D So, }  how did that happen, anyway?	39
Right.	15
I do a lot of my own patterns also.	24
Right now we have a pretty nice recycling program where a lot of the recyclable materials can be picked up [ by the, + by the ] collection agency or [ the, + the ] city along with your garbage can.	24
Shoo,  I guess so.	21
it's not.	24
{C and } instead of having [ a, + a  ] socialized pension, it just would be really money that you and your company, -	9
You can also do the same thing [ using, + ] {F um, }  if you have ground beef.	24
{C And, }  {F uh, } he chose it	24
{C But, }  {F um, }  I have an elderly grandma that lives with us.	24
Uh-huh.	15
In Honduras, very, {F uh, } {F uh, } pro-American. -	24
{C And, } {F uh, } according to Virginia, it didn't cost all that much.	24
But not a bunch.	9
we didn't have,	24
{C And then, } {F uh, } thirty, {F uh, } -	24
the best car I could get regardless of money,  <inhaling> {F uh, } I probably would be tempted by something along the lines of  a Lotus or possibly a Ferrari.	24
I think I would feel better with them attached to the actual car.	24
{C But, } -	26
<+ this is the second time the person has said 'which that' +> I know it's hard to prove rape and whatnot	24
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } really?	12
-- it's just, {D you know, } another killing.	9
Uh-huh	15
Uh-huh	15
Yeah.	15
# {C and } # the bay is circulating over your head,	24
{F Oh, } okay.	29
{F uh, } {D you know } the, -	26
{C and } his  whole idea is, we can build a better world if people get involved in good community building projects.	24
{C but } I don't know if I'll get myself to spend that  kind of money,	24
I have a job,	24
Bye-bye.	38
[ [ they, + {F uh, } they're, ] + nobody likes them ] in that part of the world	9
{D Well, } what is your view, do you consider the Soviet Union a threat?	7
[ {C So, } + {C and } ] [ he did, + he ] served better than we did, {D you know, }	24
I think # [ we do some + # -- -- they have ] pretty good engineering here.	9
{C and } they brought you another box.	24
{F Um, } are you in college right now?	7
Yeah,	15
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	36
# I think # if you can count on it every four years then people have it in mind	9
Yeah,	15
I guess, when I was growing up, [ it was, + it was ] still the ideal to [ get a, + get a ] home and buy house,	24
{C and } they're long here too.	24
{C and } at the end of  the month we tally it up to see how close we, {D you know } -	24
hard driving lady with a steel rod up her back, {D you know. }	24
The  ((   )) , -	26
Uh-huh.	15
I agree.	36
Right.	15
Real hard?	7
yeah.	26
Yeah,	36
instead of [ being, + watching ] the missiles and being glued to the tube or  whatever.  {F Uh, } -	24
[ we, # + After we ] moved away from Germany,  we moved to New Hampshire.	24
I'm not sure.	19
I do.	24
Okay Brian.	13
I couldn't make myself quit.	24
{F Uh, } even, {F uh, } I think New Zealand is [ one of, + one of ] the places, {F uh, } that, -	9
Either that {C or } hamburgers, we really don't have dinner parties.	24
<Laughter> Got a problem, {F huh? }	7
<Throat_clearing>.	20
{C and } of course Texas has it, but  they very seldom, {D you know, } put it into effect.	24
[ It's, + {F uh, } it's ] helped us,  so that we haven't been, {D you know, } too long on the month and too short on the money and -- -- {F uh, } try and stick with that	24
Whatever you ask or scream when I'm on the phone, the answer is no.	10
Right.	15
you have, just in general, maternity leave plans -- -- [ tha-, + that ] kind of thing.	9
{F Huh. }	15
{F Huh. }  Prime Air.	15
they're trying to get ratings.	9
that's true.	21
Yeah.	15
right,	36
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
What do you think about capital punishment?	31
Yeah.	15
{C and } I didn't even know it.	24
They, -	26
Yeah.	15
young men do it for two years  and the young women for eighteen months.	24
Yeah.	15
{C And, } {F uh, } I came home from work one Friday afternoon	24
Even when he's sad, {D you know, } you great faith that he will get happy again.	9
that's [ inter-, + interesting ] concept.	9
{D well, } if your ever in, {F uh, } D C, come look up Wayne (( Sherman )) , you'll say {F oh, } yeah, talked to that guy.	18
{C and } she was telling me that she was given the opportunity to manage a day care center,	24
Absolutely.	21
There's one that's got some diamonds on it.	24
Hack it all over the place?	22
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } it's a good thing because, {D you know, } [ you can't, + you can't ] knock that.	9
People that might benefit most from it  might not go in that situation, {D you know, } like people that really are trapped in  a ghetto or something like that.	9
Yes,	36
<Laughter>  We like hot food too,	24
I guess the weather, -	26
What do you look for in a restaurant?	39
# That's unusual <laughter>.  #	21
{F Oh, } how exiting.	21
Yeah.	15
{C and. } -	26
<Noise>.	20
Yeah.	15
-- as soon as we're, sure we're not going to have another freeze, go ahead finish it.	24
It's gotten big.	24
{D So } that's why I choose,  {D you know, } to drive a heavier car -- -- and more luxury car.	24
# Yeah. #	15
Boy,	21
{C But, } {F uh, } it's real handy because it doesn't have a cord	9
Uh-huh.	15
I don't have anywhere to do that,	24
it's, {F um, } -	26
{D Well, } you're walking okay  now obviously,	8
[ I used to, + I used to ] date a girl who taught English at ninth grade level.	24
[ We, +  we ] laughed about it # <laughter>. #	24
{C and } it kind of, {D you know, } -	26
{F Oh, } I'll have to look for those.	37
Was there enough to go around? <laughter>.	7
Yeah.	15
Must have left an impression.	9
[ {C And, } + {C but } ] one of the main reasons was the disposal of the oil, {D you know. }	24
there is too big of a concentration coming all at once [ to, + to ] allow for adequate melting into the society.	9
Yeah,	15
{C or }  ((   )) -	26
I think, {F um, } -	26
Are extremely poor.	2
That's right .	36
{C and } you could see them.	24
Right,	15
{D See, } {F um, } {F uh, }  [ where +  {A [ my, +  {F uh, } {D well, } my ]  grandmother passed away, but }  where ] aunts are they have these huge pecan trees,	24
Right,	36
I do like to walk.	24
yeah,	15
{C and } that really surprised me.	24
{F Oh, } have you heard  [ that, + that, ] I'm trying to think of what company it was, there was a company that was going to, {F uh, } be giving out information about your financial status.	7
{C and then } we took naps	24
{D Well, } that's probably true, too.	36
<Laughter>.	20
that was really, really good,	9
{C And } when you start doing  that you really tamper with, {D you know, } [ the, + ] all [ the, + the ]  years of, {F uh, } culling litters	24
{D So, }  {F um, } {D well } that's kind of interesting.	21
Yeah.	15
{C and } they, would level entire areas.	24
families,	30
Uh-huh,	15
I've just used WordPerfect and Lotus [ and, + ] the most.	24
<<Very faint>>  Oh.	15
{C And } some of the questions  we're getting [ are, +  are ] on site day care and  things like that.	24
{F um, } {C but } it's okay,	27
Definitely.	36
{C and } they're all one hundred  percent cotton	24
I think those benefits you mentioned, sometimes they're even more important than [ you-, + ] the wage itself.	9
{C but } {E I mean, } let them come to us <laughter>.	9
{D Well, } that's good.	21
{F Uh,  } we were down there, {F uh, } from [ eighty-six to, +  eighty-five to ] eighty-six,	24
((   )) ,	20
{C and, } it was married cousins,	24
((   )) .  <<Voice is distorted.>>	13
# No kidding! #	21
Really, where did you come from?	39
I wonder if that's possible?	8
{C because } I am not feeling as perky and good.	24
{C and } he won't even touch electrical stuff.	24
{C but } I haven't been back here long enough [ to, + to ] realize [ whether or not, + # if # ] they've done it in the last, -	24
{C But, } [ [ [ I'm, + I'm, ] + {D you know, } I'm, ] + I'm ] satisfied with my job.	24
<Laughter>.	20
My daughter-in-law is Panamanian, {D you know, }	24
{C And } that's all I plan to do.	24
[ I can, + I can ] do that  too,	24
I remember now.	24
Yeah.	36
[ I, + I ] don't think it's [ a, + so much of a ] deterrent [ as, + as ] it is [ [ a, + a good, ] + {F uh, } a good ] way for vengeance, {D you know, } for the relatives [ and, + and ] family members,	9
It is.	21
Citibank I think is always sending  (( the ))  Visa stuff out.	24
{C and } it should be a grizzly bear because -- -	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
Yeah,	15
Yeah.	15
{F Um, } I think if, {F uh, } they looked at it as a way of business helping out financially for universal health care and, {F uh, } individuals, {F um, } helping out in some sort of way whether it be taxes or some how.	9
or if somebody gets sick.	2
it's frustrating,	9
{F Oh, } that's good.	9
Uh-huh.	15
All right.	38
{C and then } things like torn-, -	24
{C So } they get you at the ticket booth and then try and get you at the popcorn and coke.	24
Absolutely.	36
[  we've got, + I've got ] a daughter.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
{F Oh, } {C so } you like to go there for the  holidays	8
No,	33
Some of them probably even do thirty.	24
{C and } you're not getting any further, {D you know, } along --	9
{C and, } -	26
That's [ why you + <laughter>, why you're ] making these calls, right?	7
The U S S R -- -- wouldn't do it. Because they got too much at stake.	9
{E I mean, } I learned  a lot about the, {F um, } Island of Puerto Rico from talking to these kids.	24
It's a lot of money.	21
{D Well, } that will continue to grow even as you go beyond graduate school.	9
Four and five.	30
Uh-huh.	15
{D Now, } Texas, is capital punishment for, -	26
I am in favor of the seven-day waiting period.	24
Now, I would like to see [ betl-, + ]  better <noise> dental insurance to me.	24
It didn't have [ what, + {D you know, } I guess what ] I was looking for at the time country tell's more of [ a, + a ] story.	24
A lot of work,	9
{C And, } -	26
before he started out on his experiments he had a battery of tests done on his body to determine the age of each one of his organs -- -- {D you know } based on how well it was performing,	24
-- seems to me.	9
[ We just, + we just ] -	26
[ [ What, +   what ] do you, +  where are you ] from?	39
Uh-huh.	15
and [ we, + ] that is getting outside  and, {D you know, } doing things they like to do too.	24
{C or } [ do you, + do you ] work or what?	35
{C or } <breathing>.   I guess maybe if I was going to buy a car or something, maybe I would consider where I was buying it, to try to, {D you know, } save a little bit on that sales tax,  because on a car that really [ mo-, + ]  kind of mounts up <talking>.	24
yeah.	36
right.	15
do we not.	23
{F Oh, } goodness.	21
Uh-huh.	15
Even some of that I like okay -- -- but not, mostly, as a general rule,	24
Huh-uh.	33
Good night.	38
Right,	36
{C or } were they reabsorbed	35
{D Hey, } the guy's making millions,	24
Uh-huh.	15
we're in a development.	24
{C and } we put the tomatoes there every year, in the same section.	24
{C and } I like to get out [ and, +  and, ]  {F uh, } to work with my hands	24
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	15
<Laughter>.	20
{F Uh, } yes.	15
<Laughter>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
let's put it this way,	17
Okay	15
{C so } there's [ no, + {F uh, } no  ] consistency there in the home or  whatever.	9
Guess I like to talk, that's all <laughter>.	38
{D You know, } it's -	26
I, I think -	26
{C but, } {F uh, } {F uh, } they have a tail race over in Lake Lavon --	24
No,	36
-- {C and } from that point on, {F uh, } [ at, + ] the N C double A does have something to do with it,	24
This newspaper has the far side and the comics that I enjoy	24
{C so } I don't have a whole lot of faith [ in, +  in, ] {D you know, } the news.	24
Yeah,	36
aunt and uncle up in New York, they kept a boat on Jamaica Bay	24
You bet.	36
{F Oh, } how about that.	21
{C And } even worse, he directed it.	24
Rainy,	11
Yeah.	15
this is how he stands such and such a day -- -- the way they break it out,	24
# Yeah. #	15
What's more likely to occur is, {F uh, } [ robbery of, + {F uh, } {D you know, } knocking over ] [ a, + a ] small store or a car theft, {D you know, } [ it, + ] things of that nature.	24
they sold the piano,	24
They have mountains.	24
{C So } [ she's, + she's ] had about enough during those days,	24
Whatever.	2
What's your favorite thing to cook if you're having a dinner party?	39
{F Uh, } as a course for P E you know <laughter> -- -- so I could graduate.	24
ye-, -	26
{C and } it's not getting any better,	9
{C And, } {F uh, } I think I am most, {F uh, } happiest with my most, familiar foods that I know are successful.	24
The only thing I know that you can recycle is milk jugs.	24
{C and } we're not going to start  going crazy and  yelling and saying, what are you, crazy, we can't understand you.	9
{F Um } -- -- I'm not really sure, because the, {E I mean } society is going more and more electronic,	9
Uh-huh.	15
{F um, } {C but } she might have some contacts  here,	24
[ It's, + it's ] really funny as an American and always being an ally with the Israelis.	24
Yeah,	36
{C and } I bet if we trace back to their, # early # childhood we could see some, {D you know, }  times they didn't get to play or be with other kids their own age really learn  how do get along with, # people.  #	9
Okay,	27
{C and } they'd lived in [ this, + this ] old, -	24
Uh-huh	15
{C and } it all, -	26
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	36
<Printer> I think one of the things that's interesting to me is if you look particularly at the political changes -- -- <Printer> is that [ the, + ] [ they seem to be social, + they seem to be economically ] driven also.	9
Yeah.	15
I get back to Price's comment when he, {F uh, } was found guilty he said {D well } he didn't have any blacks, {F uh, } {D you know, }  from his neck of the woods.	24
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh,	15
Yeah,	36
I like that.	24
{C but, } {F uh, } in my division they do, quite a bit of speech work.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D well, } {D you know, }  I think [ it probably could be, +  it always could be ] better,	32
Yeah,	15
{C but } we  just, as a matter of fact just  yesterday hired [ a, + a ] girl to, {F uh, } watch him.	24
Yeah,	15
# <laughter> # {C So } [ do you think that, +  {E I mean, } do you think that ] that was in a way though, [ good ob-, + good objectivity ]  that, that doesn't really, -	7
{C And } [ they had to, + {D you know, } they had to ]  blow them up [ or, + or ] disarm them.	24
Yeah <<very faintly>>.	15
Uh-huh.	15
hopefully [ my, + my  ] knee is a hundred percent better.	24
# {F ((Oh, } I think [ that)), # + That's ] excellent.	9
{D Well, } [ this has, + this station has ]  a lot of just ongoing news --	24
Those deaths.	30
Sure.	36
{C And } [ it had, + it had  ] broken loose enough to where if it got hot, -	24
I like the show.	24
How funny,	21
huh-uh.	15
# {C and } # I'm off them for a year now.	25
he's doing real well.	24
No.	36
Other than that, DANCES WITH WOLVES seems like to be the only thing I've seen in the past several months to have any, -	24
I've never really  gotten into it,	24
{C Or } -- -	26
-- {C and } there's always a lot of snow.	24
[ {C or, } +  {C or, } ] -	26
{D You know, } really quickly, # on # regular stations.	24
{C And } everybody in my family has always had, -	24
No,	33
[ that's, + around here in a lot of places that's ] the way it is --	24
It is,	24
{F Um, } {D well, } it's a lot of work <laughter>.	24
-- [ {C and, } +  {C and, } ]  {F uh, } -	26
Yeah,	15
{C and, } {F uh, } <laughter>. -	26
Let's talk about the baby.	18
I mean regulation.	24
That's at Skillman and L B J --	24
{C But } at least you see  what's going on,	9
{C And, } {F uh, } he's about sixty miles from here.	24
# I would think # there would be.	9
Are you doing it yourself?	7
Anyway, {F uh, } no,	13
[ they do have, + {F uh, } mostly they have, ]  {F uh, } the ads on the equipment,	24
[ Steve's, + Steve has ] a sister who has four.	24
{F Uh, } {C and } [ I know, + I know ] that {D like } in a lot of  states [ you could, + you could ] be just like released from a mental hospital the day before.   {D You know, } [ be, + be ] obviously insane,	24
I make a mean spaghetti.	24
let them measure their  (( drinking ))  water in cups	9
{D Well } first of all  [ I, + I ] [ ha-, + have ] to ask you [ how, + how ] old you are?	39
[ I, + I ] believe, if I, am in a position, {F uh, }  {D like } when my mother gets to a point where she needs special care that I will be able to just bring her into my home -- -- and my father also,  [ and + {F uh, } or ] have someone go into their home, {D you know } [ and + {F uh, } and ] look [ after + ] them.	24
{C and } you always have your house welcome,  then your children think that, {D you know, } you're cool parents and all that.	9
Yeah.	15
yeah.	36
{C and } [ it's, + it's ] an excellent movie, {F uh, }	24
After the bloom dies, they are not pretty.	9
# Uh-huh. #	15
{C so } <laughter>. -	26
I think those have been pretty much, {D you know, } banned altogether anyway.	9
It's kind of nice to have it dry all the ground out -- -- before it rains again.	9
I've had to get it from Oklahoma.	24
that, -	26
{C and } [ he, + {D you know, } he ] doesn't really enjoy doing it,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } -- -- I do know that, {F uh, } it is a problem.	9
There was a time when unions were needed.	9
{C and } it [ is +  buys ] you time to do other things, like have a dinner party, # I guess. #	9
Uh-huh.	15
On the other hand, {F um, } I think there's certainly some professions that ought to be tested -- -- because [ of the, + of their ] responsibility for the public welfare,  and  certainly people in, {F uh, } industries, {D well, } the transportation industry, [ for  spe-, + {F uh, } {D you know, } specifically. ]	9
{C but, } {E I mean, } it's still something.	9
{C so } you usually are living where your parents live	9
They kind of take over and turn into work instead of -- -- fun.	9
You, too.	38
Okay.	15
it's not even that.	24
Huh.	15
# {D So. } # -	26
Uh-huh.	15
-- {C or } <laughter>, -	26
{C and, } {F Uh, } have you talked with  a lot of people in this project	7
Right.	36
Uh-huh.	15
# {D Like } here,  {D yeah, } # it's the same.	36
{F Oh, } yeah <laughter>.	15
{C And so } he was becoming incontinent.	24
{C and } the judge [ to-, + totally ] finds it obnoxious	24
Huh-uh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	36
We moved here in seventy-four <throat_clearing>   and, {F uh, } changed locations in seventy-eight.	24
I mean, #why# would a woman choose that rough and tumble life-style when, -	9
<Lipsmack> Oh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	4
{C And, {F uh, } {F uh, } so }  we are doing it to raise money for, {F uh, } a large project at church,	24
where you don't feel rushed, {D you know } --	9
you can always play games with, {F uh, } talking about, whoa, look at this.	24
good luck.	38
[  That's, + {F uh, } that's ] on Tuesday nights I think.	24
Right.	36
Yeah,	15
Maybe not that warm.	34
I really like water sports like swimming and skiing,	24
I know, {D well,} -	24
and we're, we're uh, we deal,	24
{F Uh, } right,	15
In [ the Dallas, + the MORNING TIMES? ]	8
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } I think they have the potential of becoming serious problems.	9
[ {C and, } + {C but } ]  he said [ is, + ] that they didn't tell him anything that he didn't know,	24
Huh-uh.	15
Okay.	38
{C but } [ I don't really, + I don't ] ever take anything.	24
{C but }  she worked nights -- -- and, {F uh, } as a nurse	24
{C and } no,	33
No,	15
{C and } she said she doesn't have a problem with that,	24
{E I mean, } my, {F uh, } brother-in-law [ is like, + {F uh, } {E I mean } he's ] sixty.	24
<Laughter>.	20
Do you follow football very much?	7
right	36
it's nice to have someone understand that.	9
{F Uh, } my husband has a grandmother that lives with his mother --	24
[ I, + I ]  understand it's becoming, {D you know, } the popular thing to do.	24
I do.	24
Do you?	23
Right.	15
# What about, # -	31
[ {C But, } + {C but } ] [ the other, + the other ] difficulty [ is, + is ] that it's just, [ if, + if ] you take the (( )) [ to, + to ] feed my sheep -- -- and the question is, who are my sheep,	16
it's getting built up, {D you know, } with more [ new, + new ] shopping centers and things.   {D You know, }	24
We got her from the, {F uh, } Humane Society when she was a puppy.	24
{F Um. }	26
Yeah.	15
{C and, } # -	26
{C So } that kind of reeks havoc with plans,	24
{D Well, }  I am quite a bit older than you are <laughter>.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
Was it actually based on a book?	7
[ {C and, } +  {C and } ]  [ the, +  the ] buttons are so small -- -- to push	9
{C or }  (( {D like } )) what things are you looking at?	39
Then, [ in, +   in ] the case of airlines, of course, they became highly competitive	9
This isn't a good topic for me right now.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Anything with [ an-, + ] a, -	2
yeah,	15
-- {C and, } {F uh, } I really enjoy, especially the sixties ...	24
{C But, } {F uh, } I think there ought to be some rule against it.	24
{C But, } {F uh, } that has been the major change  that we have noticed in gardening,	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	36
Well, ours wasn't within the last year.	24
No,	36
{C and } I think the governments are working on that, to try to have some, {F uh, } businesses, {F uh, } at the borders of both sides so that [ you can, +  you ] don't have this problem of them trying to come up here [ an, + ] [ to, + to ] get the jobs, {D you know, }	9
{C But } I know what you're, -	24
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] [ how, + how ] many cases get juries might -- -- want to be reviewed, too.	9
{D Well, } [ in some places, + {D you know, } # in # some areas, ] {D you know, } depends on how far they are commuting.	24
# Of course, [ their, + # their ]  ages, they are almost seventeen -- -- [ fif-, almo-, + ] {D well, }  sixteen, fourteen, eleven, and nine <noise> --	24
{C and } you, have to make it perfect.	24
there's {D like, } {D you know, } a database of people that have  tested positive,	9
[ In, + in ] Atlanta  that's, {F um, } -	26
# Everything went all right. #	2
{F Oh, } Patrick Swayze?	7
-- {C but } that's more a matter of, -	26
Uh-huh,	15
{D Well } he doesn't care as long as he's feeding [ his, + {F uh, } his ] family.	9
You change the crank pulley -- -- the alternator pulley and, {F uh, } the water pump pulley.	24
{C and then } you have to really sit down and plan some more	9
Uh-huh.	15
Of course, [ wh-, + if ] I say this is a good value, someone else is going to stand up and say, {F oh } no.	9
how can you afford this, uh, in such a poor country,	25
Right.	15
<Laughter>.   *[[slash error]] All right,   *[[slash error should be 'aa']]	20
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } it will stay relatively well <breathing>.	24
{C but } they're really looking for someone who will pretty much fulfill the lawyers' desires.	9
{C but } more and more these days [ I'm, + I'll ] like a football game,	24
[ [ it's, + it's , ] +  it's ]  just the, {D you know, } -	26
Mainly, {F um, } if I'm really wanting an in-depth thing I'll watch C N N.	24
{C So } it is going to be hard this time.	24
{C so, }  it won't take her long. {D You know, }	24
Uh-huh.	15
If you get four milk cartons and that fills up trash bag, {D you know } <laughter> pretty easily,	24
I've seen what comes out of the ocean,	24
{C because, } he didn't -- -	26
I know, you too.	38
[ [ It wou-, + it wou-, ] + it would ] help unemployment greatly.	9
{E I mean } I have so many chores and so many -- -- obligations every day for, to add another obligation -- -- would make me feel stressed.	24
{F Uh, } that included, {F uh, } {D you know, } the doctors, the time, [ the, +  the ] hospital [ a-, + an-, ] everything. Delivery room and everything.	24
If it's the kind of river I'm thinking of,  better [ them, +  [ than, + than ] ] us,  {D you know } <breathing> <laughter>.	9
take care.	38
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } we open presents about five o'clock # Christmas, # morning,	24
-- {C and } I thought, {F Oh, } how  violent, {D you know, } to kill the rabbit.	24
do you have any pets?	7
It's funny,	21
Yeah.	15
{C So, } in order to have a reason for being there, especially as they got older, I became involved in it too	24
{C but } it's fun.	24
You may have sold a trip for some time.	24
or who killed who.	24
To me it [ didn't, + ] doesn't seem like we have got much,	9
uh-huh.	4
{F Oh, } okay.	29
{C and } -- -- {F uh, } our benefits package [ isn't, +   {F uh, } isn't ] quite as good in some ways. {F Uh, } {D you know, }	9
{D Well, } you have a good day.	38
They don't allow anything like that	24
those are things you don't really have  much control over.	9
{C but } -- -- I don't have to be conscious of what I'm doing or  how I'm doing it.	9
he goes t-, -	26
I think it's like six bucks now in the theaters,	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ T-, + they're ] only going to suffer.	9
Everybody's  going to get together.	25
In fact I'm pretty sure TI  has something like that	24
{C And } they're accidental parents half the time anyway.	9
I actually hadn't heard anything about it,	24
I like to let somebody else pay for that <laughter>.	24
yeah,	36
Yeah,	15
Okay.	13
I don't know,	19
# Right. #	15
Yeah,	15
Yeah.	15
we should and especially, if anything, be cutting taxes now because of the recession	9
I have no idea.	34
[ We did, + we did ] last night.  {F Uh, }  some real massive thunderstorms.	24
hundred percent cotton.	24
it really is.	9
{F Um, } I <music>  don't know.	19
{C and } it always smelled really bad.	24
I think it works much better [ if it's, + if it's ]  the actual jury.	9
I didn't get in debt,	24
I can't either.	36
{D well } no,	32
Right, {F uh, }	15
# thanks for the tip, Jim.  #	42
That's the barrios	11
[  I, + ] {F uh, } recently was over a  friends house that's Indian	24
{C But } [ that, + that ] was my first real experience [ with, + with ] a puppy	24
Yeah	4
{F Oh, } I see,	29
{C And } I grew up in Saint Louis,	24
{C But, } -	26
{C And } they're thinking about putting a deposit on them, because [ pretty much you have to, + ] you're having a whole separate recyclable bin just for these fruit cans, where they're -- -- so much easier just to put a deposit on it, because [ most, + ] probably ninety percent of the aluminum cans do have deposits, because they're beer and soda,	9
Huh-uh.	15
yeah.	26
# {C because } when # you start -	24
{D well } we, -	26
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
[ I + {E mean, } I ] know someone out here that makes eighteen dollars an hour.	24
{F Uh, } {D well } now, [ I, + I ] think he carpools,	24
{C because, } {D see, } that's my type of work, too.	24
Yeah.	15
I remember [ us-, + I used ] to work at, {F uh, } Kentucky Fried Chicken.	24
{C but } I think that's a really interesting question.	9
{C so. } -	26
I have, {F uh, } -	24
{C And } you take care.	38
{C so } that's what would happen.	24
# Are they #  a big Company	7
{C and, } # his Dad # did take movies of the football team  and movies of the basketball team,	24
Stuck them in the freezer and then shot them all.	24
{C and, } it's usually pretty good,	24
Yeah,	26
{D Well, } good.	21
and I said, I just can not have another cat,	24
{C and } I'm not sure what can be done to ensure that they don't.	24
{C But } on the other hand, [ it's, + it's ] also saying that white jurors [ are not going to, + are not going to ] convict.	9
{C and } he went to [ a, + a ] separate drug -- -- testing firm,	24
[ you, + you, ] {F uh, } get left out of the loop more.	9
"<Sigh> {F Uh, } I would not particularly  think I would want my kids to say, {D ""well, } I think this is what I need for Mom"",  and, then dump me there."	24
{F Oh, } really?	12
{F Oh, } you need to see that.	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I loved it,	24
{C and then } I had, {F uh, } the puppy, a little tiny puppy	24
{C and } it comes inside. #	24
{C So } they'll # put # -- -- you into keeping up the paper, {D you know. }	24
{C and } they say they're hopelessly deadlocked.	24
{C so, } {E I mean, } [ I'm used, + I'm used ] to having cats  around,	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C But } if you're a person [ who, + that's ] doing computer type things and [ you have the, + you have the ] knowledge, you know what the system you've revised and revamped the system, {D well } then [ you're + you're ] vital to the company --	9
[ Did, + ] {D well, } I've been with the company for sixteen years now.	24
<<Very faint>> Yeah.	15
{C so } we, sort of, a,    *[[slash error with a.54--two utts]] really good place to do entertaining like that. -	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yes,	26
Yeah.	36
{C and, }  {F uh, } that  particular year they had just tons of rain, {D you know, }	24
{E I mean, } that is just -- -- terrible.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
{D So, } it's not really, I guess,  camping the way [ peop-, +  most people ] picture camping in the tent	9
{C and, } {F uh, } I could go back to work.	24
Uh-huh,	36
{C And } I know it's only in a few cases	24
How would you go about organizing a family reunion?	39
What are they like?	31
Okay.	15
{C and, } {D you know, } a lot of that sort of thing.	24
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] most all, -	26
I have a sister who's sixteen years older,	24
I think those guys should be done away with.	9
Isn't that strange?	12
you, you, -	26
{F Oh, } in ten minutes, you have to talk that long.	8
{D Well, } what particularly are you interested in?	39
Uh-huh,	15
Yeah --	4
{C And then } -- -- they're, -	26
<Laughter>  No.	36
{F Oh, } [ I, + {D you know, } I've ] seen a social change,	24
{C And } we did a lot of interesting kinds of things	24
{C but } it's another thing where it's required by law	9
{D now, } you don't have to wait till the hour mark.	24
<breathing>	20
{F Oh } <laughter>.	15
It is.	36
I think that's some of it.	36
{E I mean } it's just, -	26
I work at N C N B now,	24
I've worked in public relations a lot	24
it's kind of, -	26
{C And } if they would all, -	26
Right,	15
Yeah.	36
{C And } they like the trash.	24
we're trying to improve the computer science curriculum,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } he put some crappie too.	24
I don't know.	19
Yeah.	15
I've never been up to the Yellowstone area.	24
I don't know if you tried -	8
{C and } that's what's so sad	24
{C And, } {D you know, } the hot dogs are a dollar	24
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] I had no idea.	24
[ It, + it's ]  really difficult here.   All because there's always something breaking.	24
I know someone that [ w-, + works ] in all three different stages like you said.	24
there would be some types of crimes for which you're not guaranteed a jury trial?	7
{C and } once you do that,  you lose everything,	9
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] my reaction is  I would have run over fifty people [ before, + ] rather than stop.	24
Yeah.	36
{C So } let's [ see, +  see ]	17
that's like what we were saying, though,	9
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
{C and, } {F uh, } course this, -	26
{C So, } I'd say, Vivaldi is probably my favorite, {F uh, } composer.	24
{C And } the little one, of course, [ is, + ] could care less.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{E I mean } even if  they had to pay more now,  {E I mean } in the long run it's going to cost society more to -- -- # force # two people to work. Even though -- -- # it's higher # productivity is short-term.	9
Where are you from in California?	39
yeah.	15
{C So, }  {F um, } there used to be a, {F uh, } race track.	24
[ All the, + {F uh, } the one ] with the two little girls in it, what's it called.	24
{D Well, } {F uh, } [ I, +  when I ]  was in college, -	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ I, +  I ] think it has to be some kind of common sense applied there.	9
{D you know, } I can imagine a family of, {D you know, }  four or five.	24
Right.	15
you got to have a pattern for the body -- -- {D you know. }	9
It will have something coming out of the stackhouse [ it was, + it was ] human nature.	24
Yeah,	4
{C and } I can understand why.	24
Right,	36
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	30
{C or } do you just buy along the same artist?	7
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah.	4
{C So, } {F uh, } I like to just mostly do the tie quilts.	24
Good for you.	21
Do you listen to radio talk shows?	7
Yes.	15
that's, -	26
Yeah. #	15
no	32
I know.	15
<Laughter> I don't think that's a pleasure for anybody, [ the m-, + the mowing.  ]	24
Uh-huh.	15
I am.	24
Stay out of the rain.	38
# {C but } # you don't have a Texas accent.	24
No.	36
which is a joke.	9
{C and } her ankles will start hurting again and stuff.  Even if she does get on flat ground,	24
{C and } those are man made boundaries,	24
I've driven some, {F uh, } Tauruses over the last couple of years when I've been on business trips. {F Uh, } as rental cars.	24
# {D You know. } #	26
Course, it was designed for most of us to go about forty-five miles an hour because the short on ramps and [ are, + ] off ramps,	24
Do you think that would be, acceptable?	7
Okay.	15
{F Um, } okay.	36
{C and } things that  are being taught in the home are not taught in the home, rather. More not than are.   And children being put in day-care centers from very early, -	9
I suspect [ that the pub-, + ] that there's going to have to be a lot of pressure, {F uh, } come to bear on the companies that deal with it	9
{C and } it used to be held at Lake Brownwood, down at Brownwood, Texas,	24
{C But } they said [ that, + that ] it really caused so much smog over, {F uh, } the Grand Canyon in the winter months that they couldn't do the, {F uh, } piloting, {F uh, } {D you know, } the helicopter trips and that sort of thing. Which would be horrible, because [ the, +  there's ] nothing,	24
{C And } I think [ that, + that ] maybe more widespread -- -- [ than + -- -- {D well, } than ] we'd like to have think.	9
{D Well, } <throat_clearing> what else do you serve with your pig?	39
{C but, } {F uh, } I don't really want to {C either } <laughter>, because I have no problems about it either way --	24
Right.	36
Right,	15
Do you have [ a, + a ] certain way that everything is placed out on the table [ every, + every ] year?	7
it's getting harder and  harder to survive.	9
I worked at the, {F uh, } -	24
It's all shifted to local districts,	24
{C And }  I don't know, <laughter>	19
[  What was, + what was ] your name again?	39
big deal.	9
{D well, } I really like Vivaldi.	24
yeah.	36
Yeah	15
{F Uh, }  {C but } it was things like,  {D you know, } rent and phone bills and advertising and all that other good stuff that ate them all up.	24
{D Well, } you know what the average  person, -	9
{C So, } {F uh, } -	26
That will be very interesting.	24
{C And, }  {F uh, } {F uh, } I also think that one of  the problems -	9
{C and, } {F uh, } he's not, {D you know, } -	24
{C So } we had to cancel our ski lessons <laughter>.	24
Okay,	13
Just massive rental.	8
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{F Um, } {C but } I would  have to say across-the-board, I'm satisfied with the way, {F uh, } the news is spread.	24
everybody's got a secret <laughter>.	9
{C And then }  [ with the + with the ] twenty-two dollars and the seven  something, it all came out to, [ I, + I ] ended up paying like thirty-four dollars.	24
{D You know } cutworms will do the same  thing to your tomato vines too.	9
{C And, } {F uh, } <throat_clearing> it's, -	26
{C and } I'll run around with him and stuff like that,	24
It's {D like } slow <<dragged out the word>>.	24
{F um, } {C and } wh-, -	26
{C And, } I've pressed the button.	24
{C but, } {F uh, } I feel that it, -	26
Yeah.	15
{C and then } some are people who did work.	24
<Laughter>.	20
{D Well, } it makes you feel good when you whip out the # cash instead of your plastic. #	22
{C But } [ Phoenix, + {D you know, } Phoenix ] and  Portland have both been very good clubs	9
I think it's well worth it.	9
Yeah.	15
if you get a call you don't like then it makes machine gun noise <laughter>.	24
go ahead.	18
{D Well, } I work for the state [ as, + as ] a grounds keeper.	24
Who was the quarterback?	39
{C and, } {F uh, } we, w-, -	26
{C but } people have really [ wizened, + {D you know, } become wise ] about drugs --	9
{D well, } we do bring stuff in the garage and  everything --	24
Yeah.	15
I could not believe it.	24
it would be the other way that the Republicans were real liberal minded as far as {D like, } {F uh, } moral standings and those kinds of things.	9
It's cheaper for one thing <laughter>.	24
{C So, } -	26
{E I mean, } [ we can, + we can ] now travel around the world in no time.	9
cars,	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ I would be very, + I would like to see ] some numbers on that.	24
I don't really, {F um, } -	24
that's really true.	21
{F Um, } {C and, } {F uh, } I don't know.	19
yeah.	15
My roommates are,	17
they really did like it.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } it has to be reinforced at another level too.	9
They say that system seven uses a lot of memory.	24
-- I am getting more at home phone solicitations -- -- for a variety of things from, -	24
I don't think we've done that to Saddam Hussein yet.	9
Right.	36
[ Unless it is, + unless [ it is, + I ] ] catch a fish and I prepare it.	24
{D You know, } {E I mean, } she just, {D you know, } -	26
[ It, + it's ] like most suspense movies,	24
The, the disorganized play (( )) really what it was,	22
# Uh-huh.  #	15
[ I, +   {F uh, } <<pause>> I ] don't know,	19
yeah,	26
Yeah.	15
{C And } [ he's, + in fact, he's ] a, {D well, } heart, too, -	24
Sure. <Laughter>.	15
{E I mean } if this man [ is, + is ] accused of raping someone, then I think that something like [ sex, {D you know, } + the fact that he [ se-, + sexually  ]  ] assaulted someone is a crucial bit of evidence, that adds to the fact,	9
[ Ho-, + was ] it a big change in your life, to, {F uh } -- -- have a child.	7
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } yes.	29
{F uh, }  {C so, }  those are what makes a champion I guess.	9
{D Well, } I had heard a couple of people,  {D you know, } that I had talked to about certain programs say that, {D you know, }  they had read other things besides what SIXTY MINUTES presented and that they didn't present it nearly the same way as the, {D you know, } news articles or whatever  [ they had, + they had ] already been familiar with.	24
{C And } I'm scared here by myself.	24
<Door> Uh-huh.	15
<Noise>  Okay.	13
# <Laughter>. #	20
we don't get it either,	24
{C and } if you were trying to follow  any type of, {F uh, } plot, [ it, + it ] total-, -	9
{F Uh, } {C so } [ I gue-, + {D you know, } I guess ] it works, {F uh, } much [ like, + {F uh, } {D well, } {A shoot, } like ] any lottery,	9
How about that.	21
{C But } it's a drier, -	26
[ television, + {F uh, } the violence on television ] and in the movies would be contrary to my beliefs in that.	9
<Laughter> No.	32
{D Well, } that's a neat thing to be involved in.    *[[slash error]] Because [ I think our, + I think my ] alma mater, {F um, } Gettysburg, I think they were just starting a magazine  --   *[[sd]] -- that was similar to that.	21
They generally <sigh> were able to have someone care for them at home	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yes,	36
{C and } [ I, + I ] did have to put [ two, +  two ] new front tires on at fifty thousand miles,	24
[ we're, + we're ] nine years away or less, I guess, from the next century and I think,	24
{D Well, } I think that [ if, + if ] policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion, then I don't argue with it.	34
{F Oh, } {D well, } that's good.	21
{C and } it's spectacular [ the, +  the ] thunderstorms and  rain storms you get in the spring time, the torrents of rain.	9
This is, -	26
{D You know, } particularly in some of the housing projects, {F uh, } {D you know, } [ that's, +  that  ] tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused --	9
do you know?	7
{C So, } it is something that I think, {F uh, } {D you know, }  even the larger organizations will support.	9
okay.	29
Yeah.	15
No?	12
{C And } if you're not really committed to it, -	9
{C But, }  {F uh, } no,	26
Then we bought [ our, + our ] next car used	24
{C and, } {F uh, } it's about two thousand square feet now,	24
{C and } all of a sudden my phone rings,	24
Uh-huh.	15
-- {C and, } {F uh, } <<pause>> [ get, + ] I really believe  that this Charismatic care, or  the Charismatic belief when emphasized on care, or semi Charismatic I might say -- -- was quite good.	24
[ [ my, + the, ] + the ]  call last evening was supposed to be [ about, + {F uh, } concerning  ] recycling <static>, in the community.	24
{C but } I feel likes it's on an individual basis.	9
all things being equal, yes.	11
there are things I should do.	9
It was like, {D you know, } -	26
{F Oh, } you didn't.	15
Yeah.	15
You lose four to six hundred dollars a trade in.	9
<Laughter>.	20
{D You know, } [ [ that, + that's,  ] + that's ] scary too.	9
{C And, }  as a whole, most other countries have a higher level of cradle to grave government services,	9
Things that need to be mended, # things # that have to get ironed,	24
[ {C and then, } + {C and then, } ]  {F uh, } [ I'm, + I'm ] just not sure [ if I see, + {D you know, } if I see ] it going, {A like I say } to the  right places.	24
{F Uh, } [ may, + ] it may not have been Maryland.	24
We are substantially north of New York enough that, {F uh } -- -- we don't get to go play -- -- too often.	9
{F Um, } to give you an example, both of my children are in the academy system in the Garland School District,	24
{C and } [ [ [ it, + it, ] +  it, ] +  it's ] one of these statistical, -	26
No,	15
and he said fifteen percent.	24
Yeah	15
{C and } trees help so that, {F uh, } -	24
{C but } most of us, -	26
[ My, + my ] wife [ eats more vegetables, + ate more vegetable ]  than I did growing up.	24
{C But, } {F uh, } [ I think they still have a little, + I think they're ] still such [ a, + a ] young team I think they still have a little bit to go before they reach the potential, # <Throat_clearing> # that it did when ever Bradshaw was playing.	9
It's just a, {D you know, } over priced <laughter>  downtown, # Boston # yuppie, {D you know, } # tourist # attraction.	24
it [ leaves, + leaves ] a lot of  time out for family and things like that.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{F uh, } I guess I basically agree that, {F uh, } -	9
{C So, } it was sort of a funny thing.	24
{C but } I give up,	24
{D well, } they keep it rather secretive,	9
{C and } I've forgotten what the political influence was	24
{F Um, } people start paying attention to you very much	9
(( {C and } of course ))  {F uh, } of battery or assault or, that is not a capital crime {D see. }	24
It's on E S P N, {F uh, }	24
The station finally, {A you know  how they'll put the little message down at the bottom. } Started telling everybody that they were not the ones that <laughter> had cut that off, that it was the national, {D you know, } -	24
[ I just, +  I ] don't know,	19
# <laughter> #	20
{D So, } how do you feel?	31
{D Actually, } I don't.	24
you better believe it.	13
Uh-huh.	15
you can have them in,	9
no <laughter>.	32
That's important too.	9
{C But } he likes it kind of	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ The, +  the ] interesting thing,  we're getting ready to have a house built --	9
{C because, } the mediator is an unbiased bystander who, -	24
yeah,	15
{C And } the people in the city were  saying, {D well } why should I go do that.  Make the government do that, that's not my job.	24
Uh-huh.	15
okay.	29
Yeah,	15
I do the occasional push up  and sit up.	24
{C and } nothing seems to change.	9
I'll agree with that, it is.	36
{F Oh, } okay.	29
Yeah.	15
yeah.	26
# Uh-huh,	15
{C and } she's now, {F uh, } [ four, + going to be four ]	24
Boy, they'll strip, -	26
could you tell me what you think contributes most to, {F uh, } air pollution?	39
{F Uh, } {C but, } {F uh, } no,	26
I think they do a pretty good job of selecting the most important items.	9
{F Huh. }	26
{C And } how are your kids at an age where they can contribute to what they want	31
You can any drugs you want.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
Is that why you like aerobics classes, because [ you're not, sort of, + ] someone else is doing the counting for you,   so, it makes it less of a chore?	7
I think as far as, {D like, }  our home, it's, {F uh, } in a small residential area.	24
[ That was, + that was ] the year they beat Houston in extra innings,	24
{C and then } of course there's the hunting issue,	24
{F Oh, } I love, {F uh, } blackened, {D you know, }  {F uh, } [ the, + the ] fish and the chicken and  that kind of stuff.	24
I just wonder [ if, + if, ] {F uh, } they just want to go on to other projects and not be stuck in this show, since it's gone on for so long,	9
Oh	15
{F Uh, } I haven't been to any Toronto games yet.	5
{C and } you make that money as long as you don't ever have to pay them any, {F uh, } interest.	24
-- I've been trying to put weed spray on the lawn for the whole week	24
{F Uh, } [ I suspect, + I take ] the view that cutting income tax rates has been good for [ the, + the ] economy,  that most other countries have a higher share of the tax burden in various kinds of sales taxes, {F uh, } energy taxes, particularly,  and that to the extent we need to raise more taxes, that's the direction we should look.	9
{C but } yet they accept it.	9
Go-, -	26
Uh-huh.	4
I see.	15
{C and } if they're up, I call and find out, {D you know, }	24
{F Oh, } that's neat.	21
Right.	15
{F Uh, } uh-huh.	4
{C but } the, {F uh, } -	26
maybe you've heard of A and M down here,	8
Yeah.	15
{C but } it seemed to me that [ the inner school system there was the one thing  that didn't s-, + the inner city school system was the one thing ] that didn't flower too well.	24
{C but } I, -	26
{C and } you'd type in du du du, Hi how are you, du du du,	24
{C but } I just never wanted to get into the hang-up of using credit cards and -- -- having all those bills hanging over my head.	24
[ I like, {F uh, } the rap, + the two types of rap [ I like, + {E or } I enjoy ] ] to listen to, and one is [ the, + the ] rap that is just funny, {F um, }	24
[ I, + I ] guess mostly as far [ as, + as ] <noise> crafts go, I've done, {F um, } <lipsmack> some needlepoint.	24
It is about a little kid [ that, + that  ] his parents go off to Paris.	24
We're supposed to do five minutes,	24
{C but, } {F uh, } [ it's, + it's ] camping.	24
Huh.	15
{C And then } put that back in the saucepan?	8
Yeah,	4
{F Oh, } no,	32
# For, {F oh, } th-, # -	26
We have so far,	9
Right.	15
{D Well, } they did it again, about <laughter> two or three years ago,	24
that is true.	36
That's great.	21
we have a pool in our backyard,	24
{C And } we choose to bring congealed salad.	24
-- {C and } <laughter> {E I mean, } -	26
It is a small world isn't it?	7
{F Oh, } really?	12
{F Hum }	26
yeah,	36
{C and } one of the things that  he said is, he went to Pennsylvania this weekend	24
the only thing they could do is cut off electricity.	24
Yeah,	15
# Yeah. #	15
[ Do you find that, + {F um, } [ {E or, } + {E or } ] do you hypothesize [ that, + that ] ] most of the, {F uh, } smog [ or, + or  ] air pollution comes from vehicles	7
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } {D well, } is there anything else you'd like to share me about your recycling philosophy, Julie?	7
{C and } [ I, + {F uh, } I ]  see, {F uh, } even people that work with me that are ten years younger.	24
see, [ I don't, + I don't ] like those,	24
{C But, }  {F uh, } no,	26
{C And, }  {F uh, } that's why I guess I'm sort of,  reluctantly, {F uh, } in favor of these, {F uh, } choice programs.	24
{C And } <throat_clearing> I know a lot of people it [ would, + would ] solve the convenience problem if they had curbside pickup	9
# Uh-huh.  #	15
[ Did you, + did you ] sustain any permanent, {F uh, } injury with that?	7
the price already drops in half.	9
# {F Huh. } #	26
# {C but } # it's really hard to find someplace where you can send your child and expect him to learn something.	9
not much.	24
uh-huh. #	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } this year I decided that, -	24
{C and } it can be sunny [ and, + and ] no problem in Denver	24
Yeah.	38
I was thinking also that [ there'd be, + there could be ] a fair burn out factor -- -- {F um, } in just having to respond to people's needs where the needs are sometimes, depending on the person, not going to be what we would perceive of as rational need.	9
the first two cars I ever bought, {D well, } {F uh, } {F uh, } -	24
{F Uh, } [ they will, + they will ] have articles, -	24
Yeah.	15
[ if, + # {C and } if ] it's a private sale,  of course, then there's nothing.	9
{D Well, } I got some friends that, {F uh, } -	24
<Laughter> {F Oh, } dear.	21
# Yeah. #	38
Uh-huh.	15
{C and so, } {F uh, } Tia's is probably our favorite, {F uh, } restaurant there,	24
right now we got a project going where we're trying to put, {F uh, } all my wife's stray recipes on the disk.	24
Yeah,	4
Yeah.	15
-- {C and } it is absolutely wonderful.	9
# {D Well } who knows, {F uh, }	16
{C and, } {D you know } -- -- I like my sports and everything	24
as much as a hundred  and fifty miles a week.	24
Yeah.	36
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Right.	15
Yeah,	38
That's right.	9
# {C So, }  # -	26
Yeah,	15
The ma-, -	26
I work in a school system,	24
yeah.	15
{C and } she wouldn't, -	24
{C but } they still look pretty good.	9
about six months later we realized we could use them,	24
[ Do you get, + do you work ] at home all the time	7
some of these plea bargains and all this kind of stuff that they do,  [ it's just, + it just ] gets out of hand,	9
<Breathing>.	20
{C and } you put it on a really low heat.	18
[ That's, + that's ] the key, {D you know, }	24
{E I mean, } I'll give you and   idea that I had, {F um, }	24
{C but } it was just so  real, realistic and  lifelike and good animation.	24
{C and } you get stung a time or two,	9
Really sad <laughter>.	9
((   ))  they ask why I was going,	24
[ They'd rather, + {E I mean, } they'd ] take their trucks out in the backyard <laughter>, {D you know -- } -- go out and play and stuff.	24
it's o-, {F uh, } -	26
# Yeah,	15
{C but } if she wants to go to a meal, she can go down the hallway, {F uh, } to a room where there's a cafeteria --	24
{C so, } -	26
Yeah,	4
{F um, } that's what I want.	9
He sings that.	24
{D like } do you do technician work or  something?	7
{C And } the next day they pulled the white car and took it to Arlington.	24
I don't think you have to crush the other ones for them to get to take that,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
# Yeah. #	15
Uh-huh.	15
No.	15
{C and } ... -	26
{C and } we started watching a lot of those especially during the war  or during anything kind of thing like the earthquake,	24
Maybe we'll see a growth in that  where someone makes a career out of, say, taking care of five or six children as opposed to day care.	9
{C But } that's because it's so old.	24
{C because } he was either  in a nursing home or a hospital -- -- or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days.	24
# it's right up # there,	24
# Water view <laughter>. #	9
Have a law background,	22
{C but } it could be fixed up and used,	24
{C and } they loved it.	24
She likes the chicken and fish,	24
{C and } [ it's + -- -- it's ] handy to have a truck and not have to borrow one.	9
Okay,	15
I don't know.	19
in fact, {F uh, } a friend from Germany was visiting in March	24
{C But. } -	26
{C So, }   [ I ha-, + I had ] not tried that.	24
Uh-huh.	15
my children go to Garland,	24
Uh-huh.	15
uh-huh.	15
I guess so.	9
# I think # -- -- most of it is from cars.	9
{D Well, } yes,	36
yes.	15
uh-huh.	36
{C And } I have done the same thing.	24
Just a little here, a little there.	24
Oh.	15
That works out real well.	24
Just awful.	24
Did they have an outside consultant, like [ a, + <breathing>  the  ] employ-, -	7
{C And } it's very, very difficult to find a  mechanic these days that you can trust.	9
-- {C and } almost anything you do now, a Social Security number is required.	24
Wh-, -	26
[ {C And, } + {C and, } ] {D you know, }  our son [ and, + and ]  his wife and our daughter and her husband  and the grandkids all say, get a dog, get a dog, {D you know. }	24
[ it just, + it just ] doesn't do anything.	9
<Laughter> {C And } I guess,	9
My husband wouldn't know where to hang his dirty clothes.	24
I, I think the fact that malpractice has gone up I think has raised our prices just dramatically. Um, #in the,# in the last number of years	9
{C and } [ that's, + that's ]  one real drawback,	9
{D well } [ the weather, +  let's see, {D well, } the snow ] here is different from Utah's,	24
{C and, }  {F uh, } she was not persecuted or anything else like that.	24
[ [ {C And, } + {C and, } ] + {F uh, } {C and, } ]  {F uh, } I know I'm [ [ a real, + [ a + ] real, ] + ] {F uh, } out of it in terms of taxes	24
<child>. #	20
It's a very low way of living.	9
[ I + ((   ))  what I ] use that ((   ))  outside development that we use most of it's just stuff that's been written in  (( house ))  that I use.	24
{F Huh. }	15
Yes.	13
who does.	16
Uh-huh.	15
I've only seen him in funny stuff	24
{C And } I think it's just the new way that people are thinking.	9
Yeah.	15
Okay.	29
yeah,	26
Wow.	21
Yeah.	15
[ [ {C And, } +  {C and, } ] +  {C and } ] [ even, + even ] at the beginning Dede [ and, + and ] Hunter would decide that one of them would go do this, while the other one [ would do, + would go ] this,	24
We met half way between, at her parents house	24
{D Well, } [ I'm, + I'm ] real curious to try this one that has such ((   ))  commercials.  [ The + {F uh, } that ] Del Lincoln	24
One cow,	24
Exactly.	21
Uh-huh.	15
exactly.	36
That's right	36
{C And } # -- -- I think it was the right thing to do	9
It seems to have leveled off and actually dropped back down a little bit,	24
We were all pretty close when we were younger.	3
I was going to say, y-, y-, you got as far as the, uh, chop sticks, huh.	24
Really.	15
I think people do.	24
{C And } she's really, really doing good and learning a lot.	24
{C But } it was on the fringe.	9
to rel-, -	26
# Yeah,	15
{C But, } -	26
{D you know, } [ I, +  ((   ))  [ after +  about [ thr-, +  couple ] of months after ] I ] was out of college  I finally splurged and  bought my car	24
That's one of the things that my wife and I have thought about.	24
{F Um, } I do, {F um, } television ratings	24
It's a, {F uh, } -	26
{C and, then } there's nothing that, {D you know, } really is {D like } {F oh, } so exciting.	9
If, -	26
Everything goes into one thing and  goes out to the <laughter>. -	24
{C and, } let's see, [ I have, +  I have ] two bedrooms.	24
-- {E I mean, } I guess it'd go with my flowers.	9
yes.	36
yeah.	15
It turned out to be a better thriller than I was expecting it to be.	24
# {C And, }  # -	26
{E I mean } -- -- if you handle it just like you would like a check or cash -- -- it's a lot easier to keep it in check.	9
{C And } it's not scratching your floor, because it's so thick.	8
{C but, } {F uh, }  I was just real curious when you said Middle East, # if you # -- -- didn't mind me asking.	8
Absolutely not, {D you know, }	36
{C so, } {D you know. } What does that make me, an honorary Yankee	16
Yeah.	4
{C And } they know how to act,	24
-- {C and, }  {F uh, } {E I mean, }  something you have to do <laughter>. -  *[[ This really seems to be just a continuation of B.68, not an indep slash unit ]]	9
# That's # -- -- perfect for that.	9
<Noise>.	20
{D Well } that's what my friend did.	24
{F Oh, } do you,	29
I have, too,	24
{F Um. }	26
-- {C and } they have on the ba-, {A it's five cents, } that they pay five cents  --	24
Right.	15
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
{C And }  {D actually } my neighbor has an eighteen month old	24
it seems like everything is really screwy right now as far as [ the economy, + {F uh, } the government ] goes and [ our, + our ] whole economy in general	9
{F Um. }	26
{F Oh, } how exciting.	21
Yeah.	4
no kidding. #	15
{E I mean, } they wouldn't even take [ the, + {F uh, } the, {F uh, } the ] dresser that she had that was her  own dresser, because it was just, {D you know, } full of bugs.	24
{C and } I believe it to be [ the, + a ] very true axiom,	9
#  (( {F Uh } ))  # Uh-huh.	15
{C and then } the family home evening, too.	8
{C and } they have them anywhere from six in the morning.  {F Uh, }	24
Yeah.	15
{C or, } # -	26
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
yeah,	26
{D Well, } [ that would be, + that would be ] pretty nice.	24
{E I mean, } you have heard about Dallas,	8
{C And } my husband says I do it, {D you know, }  make afghans  so I can keep my lap warm.	24
{C so } those are always fun.	9
# Absolutely. #	36
Is that what you mean?	7
There was no structure,	24
I spend a lot of time reading about these things.	24
Yeah,	15
it's more spirited  ((   )) .	9
{C but } even, {F uh, } North Carolinians, they don't know how to handle cold weather.	9
[ let's, + let's ] see,	17
{D Well, } -	26
The one we went in had, {F uh, } -	24
<Child_talking> Okay,	15
{F Oh, } <laughter> {D well, } let's hope  that [ you, +  you ] aren't employed by that craft for too long.	21
Like, {F uh, } National Public Radio or <inhaling> any of [ these, + the ] public, {F uh, } stations, {D you know. }	24
They're letting us have a lot of time on this -- -- aren't they?	7
[ o-, + ] {D so, } {D you know, } {D well, } that's, -	26
Yeah,	36
Yes.	4
All set.	24
{C and, } -	26
{D Well, } I hope the weather stays real good for them.  [ And, + and, ] {F uh, } that you have a good visit and everything.	24
<Laughter>.	20
One rotten cat <laughter>.	30
we take care of them	9
{F Uh, }  {C but } in Orlando, before I moved up, we had a real problem with it.	24
{C so, } {F um, } when we came back to Texas, I was really kind of excited.	24
-- semiautomatic would allow more rounds to be put out to hopefully catch the person [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } get him down.	9
I guess we're supposed to talk about  what's being done about recycling.	24
it's a matter of exposure really.	9
I know, I, -	26
Gosh.	21
Huh-uh.	33
Yeah.	15
[ [ {C and, } +  {C and, } ] + {C and, } ]  {F uh, } you don't realize how  many dishes you put onions in, # that it's an ingredient, #	9
# [ They # -- + -- they ] do that here.	24
Let's  find a middle ground.	9
West --	24
and we've had the ninety-eight.	24
Okay, {D well, } thanks,	38
{D actually } [ the, + the ] car that I really like right now is an Eagle Talon, which is an American car.	24
{D So, } {D well } have a good day	38
{C but } some people are more motorboaters, {D you know } -- -- which is fine.	9
One year I didn't put anything on	24
[ {C So } + -- -- {C so } ] that's what I would try to do.	24
I'd hope so.	24
# Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
I do not like it.	24
<<Very faint>> Uh-huh.	36
{C And, } {D you know, } we lived  in Oviedo, which is a small town,	24
{D Well, } we had a sonogram,	11
-- {C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } they used to use it for leather, I think <laughter>.	24
Right.	15
Yeah.	15
{C and, } {D you know, } it was just hysterical.	9
I wonder now in, -	26
None whatsoever # <laughter>. #	24
<Laughter> {C Because } they don't have to worry about going in [ and, + and ] paying, {F uh, } seventy-five dollars to have the doctor look at you for ten minutes.	9
pizzas and spaghettis and lasagnas and that kind of stuff.	24
{E I mean, } {F uh, } {F uh, } the guy  shorted us a half a cord of firewood,	24
Uh-huh.	15
it really is.	9
{C but }  for, -	26
I think, though, [ that + now that ] we're finally starting to get over the fears and [ the, + {F uh, } {F oh, } {A I don't know, } the ] guilt that we had out of, {F uh, } Challenger,	9
[  I, + I, ] {F uh, } <lipsmack> spent my [ junior year, + {F uh, } {E and }  sophomore and junior ] year [ in, + in ] college when I, -	24
{C and }  one of the three of us has an accounting background	24
Yeah.	36
Yeah,	36
{C And, } {F uh, } [ we, + I ] do some interesting recycling things.	24
{C but } the women were the ones who left,	24
{C so, } we don't have  [ any, +  any ] children yet, {F um, }	24
Yeah.	15
{C but } they weren't rich <laughter>,	24
I think that's where a lot of the problem is at first.	9
I heard someone say that, {F uh, } if they would just, something about with [ the, + {F uh, } the ] defense budget, all that extra money they're throwing back, if they cut back by so much percentage, it could throw back about six hundred dollars, on an average, six hundred dollars,	24
it wasn't that -- -- # big a deal. #	24
Yeah,	36
Yeah.	15
[ It's, + it's ] very different.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
I think we might have just screwed up the computer	24
{C So, }  as far as looking toward the future,  {D you know, } that's my plan.	24
yeah,	26
{C and } when they were coming home I was going to work.	24
{C But, }  I guess just the most significant thing changed for me, again, as I mentioned, was just in traveling,	24
{F Um. }	15
[ I, n-, + I haven't ] been to South Dakota.	24
-- {C but } more and more [ we're being forced into a  situation, + we as Americans are being forced into a situation, ] where you've got to have, -	9
[ {C And } + {C so } ] [ we, + we  ] have really enjoyed that	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F uh, } on the other hand, {D you know, } [ I, + I ] [ had a similar, + had a similar ] health plan	24
Yes,	36
{C So, } -	26
Yeah,	36
one room they completely cut up the floor in and removed it.	24
[ up, + up ] at work anyway, I use WordPerfect and Lotus  [ [ and, + and ] + ] ((   ))  which is, {F uh, } {F uh, } [ a, + a ] line-draw package.	24
Okay,	13
we used to play ball a lot	24
Uh-huh	15
{F Uh, } baseball?	7
Uh-huh.	4
[ I have more or less, + I have my favorite shows ]	24
[ The pa-, +  the paints ] peeling off of it,	24
[ I, + I  ] would like to talk about, {F uh, } maybe college basketball.	24
{C and } I'm actually sort of [ [ not, + not, ] + not ] really a Zionist per se, {D you know. }	24
She's taken the Suzanne's part,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh,	15
Oh.	15
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Oh.	15
Toronto.	13
same here.	38
a lot of people somehow or something <clanking>. -	26
He needs to do his own course of investigation [ and, + and ] see what he can do because who knows what's going to happen in another thirty years.	24
I read it,	24
this World League is coming in?	7
<inhaling> We have that here	24
it's a lot more fun than some other things I could do, I guess.	9
{C and, } {F uh, } the kids go down [ the hi-, + the hill  ] on the sleds when it's icy,	24
Yeah,	15
Yeah.	15
{C so, } we do a lot of, {F um, } things like that.	24
I really, {F uh, } like him a lot.  Which is why, DANCES WITH WOLVES was the last movie we had # seen # -- -- # for several months	24
<Noise> <<banging>>.	20
if you filed that letter with  them then they will kind of, -	22
It's interesting	9
{F Um, } I work two nights a week at a, -	24
{D Well, } they talked to one Kuwaiti woman yesterday.	24
yeah,	4
Uh-huh.	15
That's good,	21
[ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] I think black women now -	9
Uh-huh.	15
We usually give them to everybody.	24
{F Oh, } {F uh, } {C and } I was routing for the Twins myself because, {F uh, } [ they, + ] a couple of Ranger players that I had watched when we first moved here, {F uh, } went to Minnesota,	24
{C so, } I don't know where the answer is	24
# That's right.  #	21
{F Um. }	15
we're having a lot of allergies down here right now.	24
yes.	15
if, -	26
{D Well } that's neat.	21
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
{C and } I'm not impressed with the teachers that are teaching them.	24
yeah,	4
That's right.	36
{D You know, } {C and } he said, {D you know, }  I can balance my checkbook in seconds, {D you know } -- -- because it's all in the computer, {D you know. }	24
It's a, # -	26
JOHNNIE QUEST.   ((   ))  the good ones.	24
[ wi-, + with ] the, so much, {F uh, -	26
It's probably pretty close to what I have, because  I have the same kind of thing at work.	24
That's good.	21
Oh.	15
uh-huh.	36
I just kind of join up when it's something interesting	24
Yes.	36
[ they, + they ] do that on the truck.	24
{F Oh, } my.	21
{C But, }  {F uh, } I know [ I, + I ] spent thirty-four years in education here in the  Dayton area	24
It's been nice talking to you.	38
{C and } normally on my way into work I'll pick up a newspaper	24
Right.	15
yeah.	4
If there's something, {D you know, } that I want to know more about or som-, -	24
{F Oh, } neat.	21
Yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
bye-bye.	38
If it comes on, I just happen to hear it.	24
{C and } this past semester I've taken two criminal justice classes and have discussed a lot on trials.	24
{C and } I don't know what your talking about when you say health insurance,	24
# {F Oh } boy, # # that's great. #	21
{C So, } {F uh } -- -- I guess we're kind of fortunate.	9
Oh.	15
# Feel like # we've accomplished a little bit here.	24
{C and } they had a little file where they said which dealers participated [ in the, + in the ] fleet program,	24
I think he is beyond that.	9
{C and } -- -- we try and do -	24
{D Well, } [ [ I, + I'll, ] + I ] hope you'll find him.	24
#  Right?	23
The ones that are good with babies tend not to be good with toddlers.	24
I think we're going to demolish it <laughter>.	24
Right.	15
and she won't even think about it,	24
That's right.	36
yeah,	15
{C And, } {F uh, } it was, -	26
Some of it kind of falls in the rap category I guess,	24
and she takes her little girl with her	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
(( yeah	15
{C and } I freeze two containers of it.	24
What about you?	31
{C Because } it's not a full two story. Where, {D you know, } everything on top is  on bottom.	24
I like Philadelphia Eagles.	24
I'd get lettuce at the store	24
I think so.	11
{F Oh, } yeah.	21
Yeah.	36
Uh-huh.	15
People should know that that's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial.	9
-- yes.	15
I'm afraid, -	26
# yeah,	15
Oh, yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
{D Well } when all [ the, + the ] mess [ with, + ] {F uh, } {F uh, } in the Persian Gulf came about they started carrying C N N.	24
She just taught china painting.	24
{C but, } # now [ [ that, + # that, ] + that's ] what I would like, # to # have.	24
Yeah,	15
That's why I'm working in a school system so that I'm home when they're home.	24
{C so, }  anyway [ she's, + she ] enjoys her though,	24
{C and, } {D yeah, }  it's fun.	24
Only thing is, it is big,	24
{C and } it is too far south for me,	24
{D Well, } I would [ a-, + assume,  ] too,	9
<Laughter> Yeah.	15
{C And } he just forwarded that on to me	24
{C because } there's not a lot being done.	9
It was great.	24
{C And, }  I, -	26
{D Well, } I did buy a new house last summer.	24
# {C And } I want more, # {D you know. }	25
Uh-huh,	15
Uh-huh.	4
{C So } you don't have too much time for hobbies?	7
{F Um, } I crocheted an afghan for our bed.	11
(( {F Huh } )) .  Right,	15
{C And } I think he kind of misses it a little bit, {D you know, } since we moved to the city.	24
Yeah --	15
<Laughter>.	20
{F Uh. } Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
{C And, }  {F um, } [ I do, + I do ] like  Chinese buffets.	24
{C and so, } -	26
Yeah,	15
I guess, it's, whether you call it Southwestern	24
Sure.	36
Yeah,	15
All right,	15
-- without a doubt,	36
Yeah,	36
Yeah,	36
<Laughter>  {D Well, } how much do you like  lawn and garden work?	39
That's frightening, too.	21
yeah,	4
{C and } [ I've, + I've ] become I guess more of a country fan over the years.	24
{F Oh, } uh-huh	15
Yeah.	15
{C and, } {F uh, } {C then } I was a piano teacher for a while while my husband was in graduate school,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } it was so funny to watch them play against the other teams,	24
{C and } it's delicious.	24
I know I feel like I would never do that  with my parents either, {D you know. }	24
cats are really almost more territorial [ than, + than ]  dogs  are.	24
Yeah.	15
[ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {C an } ]  part of [ the, + the ] movie is where he's trying to clean this dog up	24
{C and } there's nothing, {D you know. }	9
{C  but } that's really not enough	9
Yeah,	36
Do you think that T V is, {F uh, } pretty accurate.	7
[ [ we just, + we, ] + {D well, } I ]  have -	26
Uh-huh.	15
Right.	36
I guess the closest I've ever come to participating in music is singing in the choir.	24
No.	33
Yeah.	15
{F Huh. }	15
{C But } we've got a V C R and a lot of tapes.	24
Oh,	29
[ All, + all ] you have is like towns built around universities.	24
nice talking to you.	38
That's right,	36
Right.	15
Yeah,	15
{D Anyway. } -	26
the JAGGED EDGE,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } then what melts  immediately freezes and becomes, {F uh, } a perpetual problem.	24
It was really, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
[ I, + {F uh, } I ]  get my news pretty much from the same sources as you do, although I do listen to N P R <swallowing>  [ which has very good, + {A and that's National Public Radio } # which # -- -- has very good, ] {F uh, } coverage of the national and  international news,  [ I feel + ] -- -- and does a pretty good job of # analysis as well. #	24
Okay.	15
Right.	15
Right.	15
{D Well, } {D you know, } it, {F uh, } -	26
yeah.	15
does it?	23
{C but, } have you seen the movie?	7
[ In the, +  in the ] kitchen they put real pretty  blue and tan, {F um, } wallpaper -- -- had done it up with blues,	24
{F Um, } I like to do {D like } physical things like sports.	24
{C and } California for the most part.	9
{C and } I'm really trying  to get out of that habit.	24
Yeah.	15
imagine a world where you have two real candidates and one idiot who goes out and makes, {D you know, } [ anti, + {D you know, } sort of, {F um, } anti ] women statements, anti semitic statements, anti black statements, et cetera, et cetera,	9
[ I don't, + I don't ] think that that's my responsibility [ as a, + as a ] conscientious consumer.	9
{C and } she writes the checks,	24
{C And, then } I'm going to go to Sulphur Springs.	24
That sounds interesting.	21
You sound like you're in the south somewhere.	8
#  ((   )) . #	20
{F Uh, } even though, {D you know, } [ the Jap, + the little Jap ] trucks [ are, + are ] good there too.	9
they look, -	26
It's a lot more complicated.	9
I am in Waco.	24
right.	36
[ [ I'm, + I'm, ] + I'm ] not.  {F Uh, }	24
It was fantastic.	24
you have to step down in them now -- -- because we've tilled them so much,	24
That's right.	36
Walt Disney's kind of <thumping> gotten worse # in my opinion over the past few years. #	9
{F Oh, } okay. #	29
{C but } -- -- I don't know.	19
the one issue that I would take stands with is the fact that the drug testing itself can be done on a person that is actually not on drugs and come out positive.	9
yeah.	15
{D now } I'm a, {F uh, } New Yorker by birth.	24
<Laughter>  {D Well, } that's true <laughter>.	36
yeah,	15
{C and } we didn't even  know it.	24
If you get convicted of, {F uh, } sexual  offenses, on a regular basis <laughter>. -	26
That's great.	21
(( Uh-huh )) .	15
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } I, -	26
{C So, }  it wasn't, {D you know, } -	26
(( That )) [ one, + one ] thing you said about the stars is really true	24
{C but, }  {F uh, } -	26
{E I mean, } not all the time.	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ {C But, } + {C but, } ] still it's just as hard  as having, that,	9
I guess [ it's, + it ] comes out sporadically, like, twice a week or some-,	24
Right.	15
Are you ready?	7
{C so } it was really easy for me to get quite a bit of exercise swimming	24
Uh-huh.	15
clocks.	24
you don't have a lot of time.	9
# If he # -- -- can do it, you can do it type thing.	24
[ Do y-, + do you ] get many tornados this time of year	7
{D Anyway, } I was thinking about <sniffing> -	24
is that where you are at?	38
Hang on a minute.	18
yeah	15
They put pools and garages on, but, {F uh, } no basements <laughter>.	24
uh-huh.	15
[ {C And, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } I've written [ a, + a ] letter to Middlekauff	24
Yeah.	36
What, -	26
again being from Saint Louis, I pull for Missouri.	24
the, -	26
{C and then } all of a sudden you go back out	24
{F Uh, } at some point in time I'm going to do the mirroring, {F uh, } experiment to where one disk mirrors the other for -- -- fault tolerance.	24
{C and } [ it was, + {F uh, } it was ] called MANHUNTER, actually.	24
Its [ [ p-, +  p-, ] +  proper ] name is Gomphrena.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
<Breathing> {F Oh, } I know <breathing>.	36
<laughter>.	20
Right,	36
do you have them there?	7
This is a little container.	24
{C And, } it's very nice,	9
[ they have, + # they have ] # [ to, + ]  rapidity of speech,	9
# Yeah,	15
{C and } they've had some drive-by shootings outside of the schools.	24
{C and, }  seems like the rating system,  {D you know, } is kind of switching that way a little bit <laughter>.	9
Yeah,	36
{C So } that was interesting,	9
-- {C but, }  {F uh, } -	26
Right,	15
{C but } if you have to, {D you know, } how do you make sure,	16
{C And } those two are sold together	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but, } that's basically what I do.	24
My husband makes those.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
{F Uh, } I've been real impressed with that.	24
{C so, } -	26
{F Oh, } really?	12
Yeah,	15
Her parents who were born here would like to go see it, though, I think.	24
my wife did some teaching at [ {D like, } + {F uh, } {D like } ] a private tutoring place. A Sylvan Learning Center this year	24
we did.	24
Uh-huh.	15
That might help a little bit, especially in some places.	9
{D well } the thing that's funny is  [ they've done, + {F uh, } they've done ] things like that, {D you know, }	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And so, } I think it's kind of  important [ that I, + that I, ] {D you know, }  nurture the relationship I have with my children now.	24
{D well } that's neat.	24
[ what, + what ] magazines do you have at home?	31
Huh-uh.	15
And, you know, they've been saying oh, no, absolutely not.	24
I know I did.	24
how ] it'll sway from [ one e- + one extreme ] to another.	9
Right.	15
You bet.	36
{C and } she's been in the nursing home now for, <breathing> {F oh, } I would say about three months.	24
<Laughter> {D Well, } I really can't think of anything else.	38
{C And so } -- -- that's something that I've never, -	24
{C And, } I'm sorry we don't get into a real argument over it,	24
Hello,	6
Yeah,	36
{F uh, } I don't know how exactly I feel about that.	24
Uh-huh.	15
I work for Texas Instruments,	24
{E I mean } is, -	26
{F Uh, } someplace where there,  {D you know, } -	24
I could never get the hang of it.	24
# Yeah. #	15
{D Well, } you think that takes care of the time and, -	7
U T A right here.	24
you pick them up, {D you know, }	24
Yeah.	15
[ If, + If ] you've watched it this season, {F um, } [ he's becoming, + {E I mean, } he still is ] in his own way degrading and everything,	24
Yeah?	12
Yeah.	36
I have a son who's graduating, {F uh, } in May,	24
Pretty good trip.	9
in fact -- -- there's a, -	26
[ It, + it's ] a miniature.	24
I have one daughter still at home.	24
<Laughter>.	20
I figured that, {F uh, } -	26
{C but } he's the director, {D you know. }	24
[ I, + I ] do not really know that they have the answers in those books.	19
# {F Oh. } #	26
[ {C But, } + {C but } ] still it's interesting that, {D you know, } [ he, + # he's ] # been doing this evidently for [ a, + a ] good number of years.	9
{C but } I'm from the Dallas area.	24
She knows what I'm talking about.	24
I think they've made a lot more chances.	9
{D Well, } why do you think, # people don't. #	31
Even when they were losing pitifully,   {D you know, } people still support them.	9
{C but } the Manx, is that the one that doesn't have a tail --	24
{D well, } {C but } [ that, +  that ]  stuff [ is, +  goes ] one notch beyond, {F uh, } my tolerances,	24
(( {D You know } [ in + )) , in ]  another time we had the W P A, Works Progress Administration, during the great depression, though I can't see why it was great.	24
Where did you go on your last vacation?	39
Not very often at all.	36
Right.	15
{C But } they are very interesting. [ Th-, +  that, ]  they have, what they have discovered.	9
{C and } it's really [ kind of, +  kind of ] late [ to, +  {D you know, } to ]  start, be trying to trade for somebody, especially with the salary cap that the Rangers have.	9
Uh-huh.	15
[ I, + I ] think the line item veto [ is [ not, + not, ] + is not ] necessarily a bad thing, assuming that [ [ the, + {F uh, } the, ] + the ] President, {F uh, } uses it to get rid of, {F uh, } this kind of waste.	40
{F Oh, } really.	15
# Yeah <laughter>.  #	15
{C And, }  {F um, } I don't know from my own experience,  {F um, }	24
{C So, } I can't, {D you know, } -	26
{D Well, } my parents actually started it,	11
I just want to sit down and relax.	24
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } we do [ s-, +  some ] dining out.	24
Uh-huh.	15
part time.	24
No,	33
I'm in construction	24
{C and } I don't really like some of them to tell you the truth.	24
#Yes.#	36
That's right.	36
{F Uh, } some chopped up [ scall-, + ] {F um, } {D you know, } slivers of scallions. And slivers of ginger.   And then just cover it and put it in the microwave for [ just, + just ] [ two, + say two ] minutes,  check it after two minutes to see if the fish flakes.	24
It troubles me too [ tha-, +  that ] the priority  seems to be with my particular purse strings rather than the public good	9
as far as this, <throat_clearing> that good or bad or what. -	9
# Bye-bye. #	38
{C so } for, {F uh, } the first few years she had her own apartment and, {D you know, } made her own meals sometimes. But [ could, + could ] also go and eat someplace else.	24
I guess it's fear <inhaling>.	9
It's just like [ I, + I ]  don't watch the ball die,	24
{D So } any voice, no matter what the <<pause>> speech pattern or the # dialect # -- -- or anything.	22
{C and } it's how come  he usually calls me sometimes, and says, {F oh, } I just heard on the news  that such and such happened, {D you know, }  if it's something really interesting	24
{F Uh, } {C and } we never actually experienced that.	24
they told us there would be no problem because, {D you know, } # the salesman # just doesn't really know.	24
{F Uh, } {C but } that was interesting.	24
They do,	11
and we got transferred to Okinawa.	24
{C and } I think [ it was a, + it was an ] adult book.	24
{C and } it was a guy that was just really upset.	24
In environmental engineering, {F uh, } -	22
{C But, } {F uh, } I think, -	26
Yeah,	36
{C And } I actually, {F um, } {E I mean, }  helped [ them + them ] in the sense that they received  money for working with me.	24
{D well, } {F uh, } I guess that's about it.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C but, } {F uh, } -	26
uh-huh.	15
He, -	26
It'd be nice to have that.	9
{C So } the lake life appealed to me,	24
Uh-huh,	15
{C and } especially if you have a family.	9
Yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well -- } -- yeah,	26
{C And, } {D you know, } doing the best they can.	9
{C and } they do the recycling,	24
yeah.	15
To me, the paper should just be put on the desk that day	9
{C So, } it's really rough.	9
{C And, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } you watch the people.	24
# Oh. #	15
{D actually. }  I love, {F uh, } broccoli, brussels sprouts,	24
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
yeah	15
Whoops.	21
# [ {C And, } + {C and, } ] {D you know, } they asked #  him about it.	24
{D So. } -	26
He was pretty good,	9
[ {C but } + {C so, } ] Morocco I think would be wonderful	9
{D You know, } if you were able to write a malpractice insurance that would negate any financial obligation on the part of the doctor over and above the insurance, -	9
Yeah.	15
Sure was.	36
Uh-huh.	15
No	33
# just see, see # the rest of the country.	24
Right.	36
{C So, }  # -	26
Yeah.	15
{C and, } {D you know, } he just  said he couldn't fix it	24
Right.	15
{C But } I have a degree in information management, which is computer, {D you know, }	24
Just get it out, {D you know, }	18
# {C so } # I haven't really seen any movies in the movie theater	24
{D you know, } getting back in the Daytona now, I almost don't like it.  {D You  know } --	24
You just live there now.	22
{D Well } [ are they going to beat, +   are they going to beat ] Oakland?	7
I was the, I think the ninety eighth person <laughter> they'd interviewed.	24
No,	33
it's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight # because # -- -- everybody went to work, {D you know, }	24
and we have a, -	26
{D Well, } no,	33
different kinds of voices and things.	22
# {D Well, } did you see the one. # -	7
Didn't have cash for the medications <breathing>	24
{F Oh, } okay.	29
[ {C And, } + {C and so } ] {E I mean } that's just enough to pay rent and buy like  <laughter> thirty-five dollars worth of food a month.   {D So }  [ and, + and ] pay for her [ {D like, } + {D like } ] monthly fee {D like } twen-, -	24
{C and then } during the week  you see these women, in the {D you know, }	24
{F Oh, } really?	12
Right.	15
Yeah.	36
{F Uh, } {C and } it concerns me that there  is probably a lot of mixed breed youngsters still there.	24
Uh-huh.	15
uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } they are probably not doing very well at all.	9
I am <laughter>.	24
{E I mean, } I, {D you know, } -	26
right.	15
Right.	15
I don't know what he's going to be in Austin.	24
I c-, I, I can still read music if I'm lucky	24
-- their worthwhile. Literature?	9
Yeah.	26
{C or } <laughter> what's even worse, is they promote them into a position that they can't handle  and let them get fired.	24
Yes.	36
{D You know, } with all the children around the  house, it's, kind of hard to notice that Dad isn't around, very much.	24
In fact, {F uh, } she's all upset because Galen is going to go to kindergarten next fall	24
{C And, } they have quite a few rooms, [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C so } ] [ we, + we ] will usually rent one for about a week or so.	24
I've always thought that would be a real fun thing <laughter> to do.	24
it's just been [ a-, + at ] three years.	24
this is the first reunion with my husband's family I've really been involved with,	24
Yeah,	36
It seemed like [ there, + sometimes there's ] not a good, -	9
# I am. #	24
Uh-huh,	36
That's true.	36
PRESUMED INNOCENT was the one we rented, {F uh } -- -- last weekend.	24
{C so } {D any how, } occasionally I find them in the flower beds.	24
{C and } it's deducted from our check each month and that sort of thing,	24
and that was a move in the right direction.	9
# Right. #	15
{C And } we just have a ball,	24
Yeah.	15
it's not mine either,	9
Is that what this target is,	7
<Cough>.	20
[ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {C and } ] eventually,  {D well, } especially  when it was so bad last year, {D well, } I guess it was the year  before now, {F uh, } it was so hot that year,	24
{C but } this is, -	26
that's increasing more unemployment for people that need to work. {D You know, } like [ for, + for  ] the men that don't have jobs,	24
like I'm loaded,	24
They would try to get him to exercise.	24
I think, -	26
No.	36
{C and so } -- -- it always makes their games be postponed forever and ever and ever on, on, and on.	24
Uh-huh.	15
but I'm sure there's something can be done.	9
{C and, } {F uh, } they have [ F, + F ] X TWO out,	13
{C So, } she definitely entering into,  {F uh, } a male profession.	24
they just put all our  Christmas trees in the regular, {F uh, } compost, pickup	24
her father was a fairly, uh, high ranking official under Somoza.	24
[ Is that, + is that ] true [ for, + for ] Atlanta?	7
{F Oh, } {D well, } [ I'm in, + I'm in ] (( the ))  C building,	24
{C and } all they want is just for everything to be happy,	24
{C But, } <sigh> I don't know.	17
I, -	26
# {C And } # there's only so much football you can watch.	9
{C and, }  {F uh, } [ it, + it ]  creates a problem, {F uh, } {D you know, } when you're on the road.	24
{C And, }  {F uh, } I got to stay home with my kids, which I really wanted to do,	24
are there kids that are there too, <baby_crying> or mostly adults?	7
{C And } as we were doing it, too,  everybody noticed that there were all these big guys of assorted nationalities.	24
It was a somewhat of a commercial because it [ c-, + ] I saw it regularly	24
{C and, } {D you know, } what I like the most about him, is, {A I've gone to see him in concert, {C and } } [ he always, + he looks  ] like he's having fun.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{F Huh. }	15
{C Because } I'm always worrying it  won't firm up because [ it, +  when you take it ]  out of the saucepan it's like, boy, I hope  this thickens a little more because it's not like real package thick, {D you know, }	24
[ Are you in that part, + are you in the south part ] of town now?	7
That's a pretty good size room.	9
{D So } <laughter>. -	38
{D well, } [ that's, + that's ] neat.	21
I, agree with that.	36
yeah.	15
I know that, -	26
-- yeah.	36
I've got kids all over the United States	24
I don't.	34
((You ut-,)) -	26
{C But } of course, here we wear a light  weight jacket a lot # {D you know, } {D you know, # }	24
[ it was just, + {D you know, } it was just ] [ plain, + a plain, ] {F uh, } [ ro-, +  {D you know, } round, ] {F uh, } necked, {F uh, } [ sw-, + sweater. ]	24
{C but } I'm going to give it thumbs down.	25
{C and } I guess I'm going to have to try that area sometime and see what it's like.	24
Yeah,   {F Um. }	15
It's just a couple hours.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } at the gym, even in the class, {F uh, } I, [ w-, + ] [ e-, + ] -	24
Yes,	36
{C But }  it's, -	26
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Because I work some weird hours and do some traveling.	24
the town is smaller --	24
Uh-huh.	15
I'm from Berkeley, California.	24
{C But } they do have to visit,  [ and + ] [ if, +  if ]  the parent can point out all the different places to look [ for -- + -- for ] scholarships,	9
{C and then } you look at, -	9
Yes,	4
{C So, } {D now, } {F uh, } not  [ that they may, + that may ] matter,	9
Bye-bye.	38
{F Oh, } twenty, {F uh, } seven.	24
{D Well, } [ I, + I ] felt good about it because  that's my personal feeling also.	3
You, {F uh, } had, {F uh, } contributed x amount last year.	25
-- {C but } [ you, + again, you ] need that one on one like a big brother, trying to [ keep the younger kid, + {D you know, } tell him,  ] hey stay in school,	24
{C but } that's all.	24
{D well } those take a lot of time.	9
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
I noticed that HUD was in terrible shape	9
{F Oh, } yeah.	12
# Yeah.	36
{C or } what [ era <<mispronounced>> do you, +  era do you ] like the most?	39
It was [ n-, + Nice  ] talking to you.	38
-- [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C so, } ] I've been very guilty about  not making the effort [ to, + to ] [ take things where + take things where ] they belong.	24
we have found state parks, not that they're lacking	24
Uh-huh,	36
{C and } she's going to get her car,	24
{F Huh. }	15
Although dealing with geriatrics is something a lot of  young people just aren't emotionally prepared to do.	9
# Yeah. #	15
[ I, + I ] [ d-, + don't ] feel comfortable about leaving my kids in a big day care center, [ but, + ] simply because there's so many kids and so many <sniffing> <throat_clearing>, -	24
Yes,	36
{F Um } <laughter>.	26
{F Oh, } yeah.	21
Big Sur Highway, that's, {F uh, } where you're  pretty much in view of the ocean almost all the time -- -- aren't you?	7
We're to talk about what, lawns and gardens?	8
I used to until [ it, + ] I got so allergic to it.	24
What I think.	24
then they got into lots of trouble.	24
{F oh, } yeah.	36
{C or } probably in College Station there wasn't a whole lot of choice.	35
Yeah.	15
# I didn't # -- -- even know the person's name that had given <<mispronounced>> me the hard time or anything --	24
the man, {F uh, } has a lot of good ideas,	24
I'm not sure I could do much better today.	24
now here [ in, + in ]  Texas, {F uh, } all you need is a driver's license.	24
Yeah,	4
<Laughter> Yes,	15
[ {C or } + <laughter>, {C or } ] is something wrong with it	16
It would probably be somewhere closer  to, <sigh> {F uh, } less control because I don't see, -	24
{C But, } {F uh, } I certainly, {F um, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
nice talking to you.	38
thanks.	42
My mom -- -- would be like, uh -- -- #eat it or don't eat anything.	24
{F Uh, } as far as my defense budget, {F uh, } they're cutting  it back now, what, twenty-five percent?	16
{F Um. }	26
{F Oh, } is that right.	12
{C and } she was already in it.	24
<Children>.	20
{C And } I'm not to far from it  another year and a half.	24
{D Well, } [ we could ch-, + we could ] really talk gardening a long time.	24
It's about ten miles --	24
Yep.	15
Yeah,	4
{F Uh, } I don't know about Dallas.	24
{C But } [ I have to, + {D you know, } I have to ] put my foot down, [ where, + where ] my life begins.	24
# {C and, } # {F uh, } just, everybody be damned and  live with some one,	9
She plans it all out.	24
-- {C but, }  {F uh, } [ [ it's, + it's fun, ] + it's a fun ] thing to do to get out and -- -- be entertained for once.	24
yeah	36
{C Because } no matter what I did or how I did it,  I invariably got myself wet.	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C But, } {F uh, } -	26
{C But } it wasn't too long until she, {F uh, } found out she could wait until I let her out in the morning.	24
{C And } even in our field we have people that are in very high risk jobs	24
{C And } they provide one meal a day.	24
[ I, + I ] see a difference in [ the generation of, + even the generation ] before me, # {F uh, } # were, {D you know, } mom was like, {F um, } [ Mrs Cleaver, + {F uh, } {D you know, } June  Cleaver ] or whatever,	9
{C But } I can promise you that those credit card companies are going to ride high on my money <laughter>.	24
{C so } that's, -	26
{C and } that's exactly what they said, <<trying to sound like a man>> my wife dragged me away from the television.	24
Yeah,	15
I, -	26
They were pretty much in good  taste,	24
[ {C and, } +  {C and } ] we went for a test drive in that	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } she seems to.	24
I only have one other person I know [ in my, + in my ] group here that works where the wife stays home,	24
Is this, -	26
{D You know, } people aren't doing anything just sitting around, {D you know, } no thinking involved	9
Did it change anything for you?	7
{F Uh, }	15
Bye.	38
{F Uh, } there was a time when maybe we didn't take all of them off,	24
here in Pittsburgh the health care, {F uh, } rates [ are, + are ] going  up pretty quickly.	24
# {C and } if # you get one bad apple, there's are at least other people that can see it.	24
it wasn't a strong issue, {F um, } I guess it still isn't a strong issue.	24
Uh-huh.	15
<Child_yelling>.	20
-- {C so } [ I, +  you ] hear so much,	9
Uh-huh,	15
{D See } mine are up and bloomed already	24
{C and } they've hired all these administrators in on that, {D you know. }	24
I know.	21
Right.	15
Ooh.	21
Wow.	21
{D Well, } do you have any?	7
Uh-huh.	15
No,	33
I don't know	19
<<Talks to person in background>> # Bye,	10
They have got the track on the inside.	24
Uh-huh.	15
<Laughter>.	20
# That's a real good idea. #	21
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } # yes,	4
{F Uh, } {C and } that way, you can have a variety.  {F Uh, }	24
She was the [ greatest, + greatest, ] {F um, }  went through two generations of children in my family and was always very gentle.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{E I mean } her bonus isn't that much,	24
{C and } that's the easier thing to see,	9
{F Oh. }  Nice.	21
{D Well, } [ just, + actually, just, ] {F uh, } item analysis, statistical analysis of the tests, {F uh. }	3
{C and, }  {F uh, } still on the other hand we're also, {F uh, } -	24
{C and } I just started ordering some parts	24
-- {C and, }  {F uh, } she was from a relatively wealthy family,	24
{C But, } {F uh, } it's a problem,	9
{C So, } I got to hear a lot of what the people thought about,  {D you know, } changes [ in, + in  ] the war and everything,	24
{F Oh, } [ I, + I ] know some of the people.	24
{C But } it's interesting that, {D you know, }  with the topic I think I agree with you.	36
{C but } I feel like we ought to be spending maybe the same time and effort [ and, + and ] energy into trying to solve our own or resolve our own.	9
That's true,	36
People # are pretty excited about it. #	9
[ That's, + that's ] kind of great.	9
I beli-, -	26
when I was growing up my mom worked too,	24
{D Well, } at the moment we're doing very well on inflation.	9
Uh-huh.	15
I haven't ever noticed the thirty second warning actually.	24
{C and } they're making clothes now that are recycled.	24
What's inside the jelly bean?	39
{F Um, } {D you know, } that was mainly for people in  motor homes [ or, + or ] had trailers [ or, + ] and so on and so forth, where, {D you know, } we   really wanted to go camping in a tent --	24
{D Well, } last year he was  a little bit young for having one.	9
{C and } there's no way that, that can be done.	9
We're really not compulsive shoppers, {D you know. }	24
Okay,	30
You just go  and, {F uh, } buy the gun	24
We try to do everything we can together.	24
{C But, } {F uh, } we all got together for just a party.	24
{C and so, } you, on that <breathing>, -	26
Yeah,	15
{C But, } I do enjoy, -	24
{C And, } {F uh, } people didn't get paid much there at all.	24
{C But } I, {D you know, } worked, -	24
yeah,	15
Right.	36
it's a symptom that [ there's, +  there's ]  a general illness that needs to be healed.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } goodness.	21
{C but } it's not a big deal,	27
{Very faint} Yeah.	15
yeah.	26
Huh?	14
No.	33
{C And, } {F uh, } [ it was, + it was ] pretty shelled, {F uh, }	24
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } that's good.	21
Yes.	4
Uh-huh.	15
I think in, {F uh, } the Texas governor elections, I think more people turned out to vote against somebody than for somebody, this time.	9
{D Now } to me that's kind of a drawback.	24
I don't know <throat_clearing>.	34
{C and } you have to get a feel for, {F uh, } how they treat the kids  and, {F uh, } {F uh, } what kind of staff members they have  and -- -- how much turnover they have  and things like that before you -- -- commit your child to them.	9
[ I'm, + I'm  ] just going to, {D you know, } [ vote, +  vote ] against the incumbent every time doesn't work,	9
Uh-huh.	15
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] the son refused to do it.	24
Yeah,	15
-- {C but } [ they have little, + it's like {F uh, } on each floor they have a little ] kitchen area -- -- where you can go down and [ have a -- + -- make a ] meal, {D you know. }	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
{C but } when you're only earning half the salary. Even though I wasn't spending much money, [ I sometimes + I sometimes ] would just, -	24
{C And } we didn't buy really new or expensive cars.	24
Uh-huh,	36
{C or, } -	26
{C And } right now I think  [ Memphis and, + it's Memphis and ] I think Baltimore have a really good shot at it.	9
{C So } finally, {F um, } [ they, + ]  the people put so much pressure on the city,	24
{F Oh, } boy.	21
It's pretty remarkable because growing up  we've always had a beautiful, lush green lawn,	24
{C because } # it's going to be totally different,	9
{C but } seems to me like if they made the hole bigger it'd be easier.	9
I like to watch almost all the football	24
{F Um, } at T I they're doing recycling.	24
# Yeah. #	15
Let's see, {F oh, }	17
<Laughter>.	20
Yes.	15
[ I, + I ] kind of wish we would have maybe gone for the G L rather than the D L	24
I, I, I heard a story a while back	24
{C and } I think that's one of the things  that both of us are not wanting to start over with, {D you know. }	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
I've -	26
{D Well, } {F uh, } the flowers I'm just, -	24
I do plan my clothes a week in advance.	24
That's right.	21
{F Oh, } my word.	21
-- {C and } Coppell's not really big enough to support [ fo-, +  four ] grocery stores --	24
{C but } it's comfort.	9
{D see } I don't believe in war.	9
a typewriter with memory [ would, + <<pause>> would  ] have been fine,	9
{C and } we had her for six years until she just passed away recently	24
Do you work outside?	7
I have a seven year old and a ten year old.	24
# nobody # talks about it for women except  other women and other men.	9
Yeah,	36
{C and} of course those are two different issues as far as privacy goes --	9
[ {C And, so, } + {C so } ] that one was  all right.	24
I read a book one time that said that the best cars were made before seventy-four.	24
I spoke to a person from Texas, too.	24
{C But, } Yeah,	26
Uh-huh.	15
[ One, + one ] of the problems they're facing now, a lot of people now, [ is that the health insurance + is that the small business ] [ can't, + can't ] offer health insurance --	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } it takes me almost the same amount of time to go to Frederick, [ but + ] as it does to go to [ the, + the ] ballpark [ in Me-, + in, {F uh, } Baltimore. ] Because, {F um, } to go out to Frederick, I just jump on the Interstate	24
Some of the crimes are just so brutal and so, {D you know, } useless.	9
{F Oh, } do you?	12
{C and then } we've gone to Sun Valley several times,	24
<noise> they claim that's why we're still there.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C and then } let it sit on the bottom,	24
I'm Lee with, {F uh, } {F uh, } -	24
that <child_talking> was sort of the beginning of, Ye shall be treated fairly.	9
-- {C and } [ he decided, + he ]  also got into the graduate school of music as an undergraduate -- -- for classical guitar,	24
Yeah.	36
uh-huh.	4
Oh <<faintly>>.	15
Especially when you look for the, {D like, } popular radio stations like mostly the music stations, news [ is, + is ] pretty much nonexistent.	9
True,	36
he just piddles on this and  that.	24
{C and } I think it gets them prepared [ to, + to ] learn how to volunteer as they get older.	9
Uh-huh,	15
{C and } we'll let them try to drink out of some of the lakes -- -- and try to fish in some of the lakes that have been suffering from, {F uh, } the, {F uh, } acid rain --	37
<Laughter>. #	20
yeah.	15
{E I # mean, } it's the basic premise with, # {D you # know, } drug testing.	9
{F U-, } {D well } no,	33
What do you teach, what grade?	39
I had not watched them very much except when I was abroad, until the Gulf War.	24
{D Well, } a lot of our entertaining anymore with the couples, again, that we've known a long time like you, [ they, + {F uh, } we ] all bring things	24
{C and, } -	26
Yeah.	36
<clicking> <music> {D Well, } Kathleen, do you believe that there is a problem with our public school system?	7
{C and } they just get you every direction they can.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Housekeeper, uh-huh.	30
# <Cough>. #	20
I just feel that, -	9
{C and, } {F uh, } supposedly this guy [ had, +   had ] been breaking there for awhi-,	24
yeah.	15
I got in trouble when I was in the service quite a few years ago {D like } ten to fifteen thousand dollars in trouble.	24
# For, # -	26
the subject of music <Laughter>.	24
Right.	15
<Laughter> Yeah,	36
{C But } if you have to get up and get out in it, I don't like it either <laughter>.	24
{E I mean, } [ you look, +  you look ]  at the number of marriages that are occurring right [ ou-, + ] {E I mean, } even in high school,	18
right.	15
Right.	15
No,	33
Uh-huh.	15
-- {C and } [ {C so, } + {C so } ]  that's, {D you know, } another advantage.   {C And then } even things like airline tickets you automatically  get flight insurance which, {F um, } (( [ you )) , + hopefully you ] never use.	24
-- {C and } I have been living in it ever since,	24
{F Uh, } then I, -	26
{C And } did you know John Sununu is, {F uh, } half Arab?	7
{C and, } {F uh, } <laughter>. Poor thing he comes home very depressed every night <laughter>, because the world has so  many problems of that sort,	24
{F Um. } How old are they?	39
Uh-huh.	15
especially, -	26
you work then?	7
{D you know, }  when that subject  comes up they can say yes,	24
Probably so.	11
{D well, } it used to be the largest bank in San Antonio until  N C N B came up and bought the rival	24
I mainly play the guitar a lot,	24
how do you manage both of those?	39
[ They, +  {C and } they ] have had lawsuits over it.	24
{C So, } {F uh, } {D you know, } I've touched on that.	24
Really?	12
{C but } most of the time you can wear a sweater	24
{C But } I can carry as much in my Honda  or more than I can [ in, + in ] those other bigger cars.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } you can just say [ I'm sorry that yo-, + {F uh, } I'm  ] not required to give that by law	24
You have to start wondering # if they don't want you. #	2
{F Oh, } really.	15
# Huh-uh. #	15
{C And } I love twice cooked potatoes.	24
I wanted to get out and  see some things.	24
{F Oh, } it is <<whispering>>.	36
{F Oh, } okay.	15
{C But } normally we don't think about it until, -	24
you're in [ the, + the ] styles that they have started building in the last couple years with the real high ceilings,	8
that's, -	26
he really likes Shenandoah.	24
No.	36
Uh-huh.	15
And, uh, uh, you know, you, you figure out the options, go around look at the dealers and get the best price you can and then go call this guy and, and tell him what you want	24
No,	36
That's okay,	27
{D well, } it's not little any more.	9
Yeah,	15
# <Child_crying> {F Oh, } gosh. #	21
{C but } I enjoyed it.	24
# Yeah,	36
that's stuff we never even thought about  three years ago.	9
{C and, }  {F uh, }  I read a lot of non fiction books, too.	24
hold on,	25
uh-huh.	4
Um.	15
G T E purchased  (( Tigon )) .	24
<Laughter>.	20
Precious and Rascal are brother and sister	24
{C but } -	26
Yeah.	15
It was really good.	24
{D you know, } it drops, {F um, } -	24
Probably know him if I saw him.	9
I would just be irate if they said it was positive and I knew it wasn't,	24
Was you, -	26
I know.	36
Yeah. {F Um, }	15
He's getting lots of overtime,	24
{C and } he's going to be in also.	24
{C So } I stopped that after a year, because it was difficult -- -- to balance it,	24
{C And } I talked to this person who I gathered from  speaking to her, [ that, +  that  ] she and her family just didn't have much,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } I think somehow, {F uh, } safety courses -	9
They've  ((   ))  some companies that are doing, {F uh, } hair tests.	24
{F Um, } bye.	38
{C And } me it takes me five to get there and five to get it in.	24
# <Laughter> # {D Well, } he went tumbling down the steps along with, {F uh, } shooting his foot almost off.	24
Yeah.	15
I think trial by jury is very good.	9
{C So, } it's one of those things that they really, -	9
Uh-huh.	15
It was on, {F uh, } New Year's Day.	24
Right.	15
{C and then } they recycle the containers.	24
they're pretty amazing.	9
Yes.	30
Aspen?	7
{F Um, } that's a good question.	3
<Laughter>.	20
{C and } it was very  easy [ to, + {D you know, } to ] put everything out there,	24
[ I'm, + I'm ] covering, {F uh, } weekends and nights now.	24
I just never really thought about it	24
Now, you can {C either } use, {D you know, } the kind  that comes in the little can	18
Oh.	29
yeah.	36
{C But, } {F uh, } he was in the nursing home the last several years of his life	24
# I, -	26
Yeah.	15
{D you know, } I'm more, -	26
it is,	24
{C and } the average person can't afford, {D you know, } a heart or a kidney -- -- on just their own.	24
Uh-huh.	15
<Laughter>.	20
Pay attention to what's happening.   Talk to the teachers.   {F Uh, } talk  to their kids about school.  And support the institution	24
{C And then } second thing, we still can't put the boards in, # because they # have other things blocking where we need to do it.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I really enjoyed driving  that car.	24
My dad is a big blue grass fan,	24
it's, {F uh, } {D you know, } new to learn [ some, + ] what different people eat,	38
# Right,	36
Right.	15
Now, this year, it's, was hard with our son now being in college.	24
<Throat_clearing> In fact, they  even do that for operas [ sung, + sung ] in English, because it is hard to understand the words sometimes.	24
What do you think,	31
Uh-huh.	15
Oh  (( really )) ? Yeah,	12
you too,	9
it is temporary.	36
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
I guess it just couldn't handle, the stress, and [ the heat, + the record heat, ]	9
{E I mean, } [ I'd, + I'd ] be afraid to [ be in school, + {E I mean } b-, teaching, ] or even being a student	9
{C But } this particular case, {E I mean, } they had a complete confession from the guy -- -- with a lot of things [ that, + that ] the police hadn't released	24
you know exactly [ what it, + what it's ] like then.	24
{F Oh, } yeah,	36
Really?	12
Right now I know the azaleas and everything are out are beautiful.	24
they have, {F uh, } -	24
I was suffering for about three weeks later.	24
{C but } then when, once it finally affects you  [ then, + then ] it really starts to bother you.	9
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
[ you, + you ] became accustomed to it, I guess.	24
{C and, {F um, } then } just something for desert, {D you know, } bread and wine and cheese stuff like that.	24
I'm sure you probably have heard of the Genesis program that's going on currently out in the Arizona desert.	8
# I got called	24
Right.	15
-- yeah.	15
Try that.	18
Margaret Truman Daniels writes a lot those.	24
{F Uh, } I don't know, though,	19
{D Well } then [ it is not, +   it is not ] a Dutch iris then.	24
{F Uh, } it was in March of last year.	24
Type of thing.	22
Really.	15
[ I, + {D you know, } I ] don't know,	19
{F Oh, } it is,	36
My God, it's ridiculous, {D you know. }	9
yeah	15
Yeah.	15
Isn't that sad? {D You know. }	7
{C And so } I went ahead and bought another standard when I bought the Honda	24
Yeah,	15
{C And, } {F uh, } there was a suspicion, # that # it was a virus	24
Well, and one of the things I'd, -	26
[ That was a lot, + that's probably the most ] fun I had.	24
Something to stay active at -- -- for a long time.	9
{C and so } I keep hearing the forecast it's going to rain, it's going to rain, it's going to rain,	24
[ that's, + that's ] not any fun.	36
Uh-huh.	15
yes.	4
{C And, } -	26
{C but } you don't, {D you know, }	26
I just got in from outside,	24
Yeah,	15
Yeah.	15
{C So } [ you'd, + you'd ] rather see it harder to convict somebody.	22
the, {D you know, } Mercedes, Volvos, things that they can get, {D you know, } big dollars for -- -- and the jewelry are the major targets,	24
I was in New York in the sixties.	24
Tends to, tends to strap only the legitimate people.	22
{D Well, } I bet you, -	21
# Yeah. #	30
It's about an inch and a half long	24
{D See } that's what it is here too.	24
you have to be so precise.	9
{D Well, } {D you know, } [ we're, +   we're ] not ones to budget much, {D you know } <laughter>.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh } rather than she needs the money -- -- # just she wants the # -- -- # stimulating # environment <noise>.	2
{D well, } I sure enjoyed, to you about exercise and fitness.	38
Uh-huh.	15
I play softball one night a week.	24
{C And } they were gone <laughter>.	24
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } you were?	12
Uh-huh.	15
I can't even hear what you're <static>, -	24
{F Oh, } that's good.	21
Yeah.	15
With two little kids I can understand that.	21
{C and } I think she even gives mom and dad a little bit, {D you know, } of rent money.	24
{C but } I haven't been, # down # there.	24
{C So, } -	26
almost all of them had a Montessori section.	24
{C and } one man in particular had reservations made, plane tickets made, everything,	24
{C So, } what kind of a house do you live in?	39
{F Um, } {C and } they both, {D you know, } -	24
Right.	15
{F Oh, } really.	15
<Laughter>  It's pretty wild.	9
I have no clue.	24
<Talking>.	20
Yeah,	15
{F Oh, } [ y-, + ] {E I mean } I know  people [ that graduated, +  {E or } that I went to high school ] with that went to civilian colleges	24
{C So, } {E I mean } I remember, {F uh, } right around then that's when I first started hearing about Vietnam.	24
<Child_yelling>.	20
<laughter> Like fishing and ... -	22
# Yeah. #	15
Uh-huh,	15
Okay <laughter>.	38
Yeah,	15
I think the old gas chamber seems to be about the most painless	9
{C and } that leaves the children without any parents.	24
That's just what on their part,	14
{F Uh, } not that I don't enjoy <whistling> newspapers or anything like that	24
{F Oh, } {D well, } I thought, isn't he the same one?	7
# {D Well, } # -	26
Uh-huh,	15
{F Uh, } it's getting to be more and more of a possibility.	11
Are you?	12
{C But } I don't follow any team.	24
# Yeah,	36
Is not -- -- real cost efficient.	2
I don't know	19
Yes.	15
{C and then } all of a sudden everything  clicks in, {D you know. }	9
yeah.	36
right.	36
No,	36
{C and } finally it dies down,	24
<Laughter> What do you like to do when you go camping?	39
Yeah.	15
<Laughter>.	20
{C and } [ if, + if ] and when he [ comes, + ] gets free again, # he # will have no compunction   but to [ complete [ that, + that ] same kind of lifestyle, + {E I mean } continue that same kind of lifestyle, ] # and # perhaps do the same thing again.	9
Right or wrong I'm going to cast a ballot	24
-- {C so } it's maybe {D like, } {F uh, } {D you know, } -	26
Uh-huh,	15
R-, -	26
{C But, } {F uh, } it's just as suspenseful, I think.	9
# <Laughter>.  #	20
definitely able to go to war twenty years ago but not vote.	3
{F Uh, } sort of on a peripheral.	34
{C and } I have another friend in, {F uh, } Costa Rica that, -	24
{C and } she said make me one,	24
[ my, + my  ] son works for, -	24
Yeah	15
Yeah.	15
There's minimum wage jobs,	24
Right.	15
they're expensive cars to keep up when they need service,	9
some people, boy, they got, -	26
I think, {D you know, }  the lottery could have helped, with that.	9
{F Uh, } my husband and I had this great  desire to go see a comedy	24
I know that it's getting to the point that the insurance doesn't <children_talking> pay that much on catastrophic illnesses.	9
Yeah,	4
I did.	24
maybe it's not a good example.	19
This is true.	36
# {D Well, } [ {C and } a-, # + {C and } another ] one now that  it's getting darker	24
Really.	15
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh,	4
Yeah <laughter>.	15
I have wonderful friends.	24
{C and } most of our expenses are fairly the same every month with the exception of utilities and things like that,	24
That's what I need to do.	24
{C and } I have been totally engulfed with Golden Delicious apples.	24
{D Well, } I would just think if Bush was so successful in lining up the correlation to prosecute a war, then he should be equally successful in getting that same correlation to push the United Nations to, {F uh, } {F uh, } somehow persuade those nations to give the Kurds a homeland	9
good.	21
I live in Dallas,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	38
You can have  birthday parties there	24
Some beet, {F uh, } potatoes	24
What power do we have?	16
That didn't last long  ((   ))	24
{C and } it's a great [ stress, +  stress ] reliever.	9
{F Oh, } okay.	15
Yeah.	15
{C and } [ I've discussed, + # I've discussed, ] {F um. }  # -	24
<Laughter> Yeah,	15
I, {F uh, } haven't been out all year.	24
it's, -	26
Yeah.	15
{C And } I, -	26
Yeah.	15
I don't think they've ever made a movie, do you?	7
{C and } that. -	26
Yeah.	15
# {C But } # there's a lot of l-, -	26
{C and } [ it's, + there's ] not a language barrier	24
<Laughter> That's right.	36
uh, uh, incidentally, -	26
{C and } [ I, + I ] did not work as a matter of fact,	24
{D like } years ago my wife and I got married --	24
<Music> {D So } have you got a pet.	7
{C but } {D you know, } the thing is that this happens,	24
ours is pitched so shallow that you, {F uh, }  don't get much room in the attic.	24
We have to <breathing> dig up a baby-sitter	24
# Bye. #	38
{C but, } {F uh, } {D you know, } -	26
Really.	15
it tasted like they were trying <noise> to do the best they could,	24
{D So, } {D Well, } are you enjoying staying home?	7
I think that's where it stems from, is that and, {F um, } {D you know, } you've got [ a lot of, + a lot   more ] women that are working nowadays -- -- that aren't home with the children --	9
a bunch of us  ((   ))   were pretty avid [ golfers. + Golfers, ]  so we will go  out	24
one is,  it's restricted in the sense that, juries only decide the charges that are  actually, {F uh, } brought, {D you know } --	24
I think they know what they believe	9
{C and } I don't know that that's not a good idea.	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C and } whatever pop we drink, we used to take the boys out for a bike ride, and pick up the litter, {D you know, } [ the, + the ] cans --	24
We don't do  anything exotic	24
[ [ If you, +  if you, ] + if you're ]  not buying the most expensive clothes out there [ the, + the ] quality is really not that great,  {D you know, } for the price that you pay.	9
I think some of, is how the, {F uh, } {D you know, } -	9
{C And, } {F uh, } [ y-, + ] as you know,  with five children it takes a lot of work.	9
It seems like we have a lot  of these that have been in <noise>, # Texas, # called P M Melody,  who does a lot of writing on co-dependency.	24
{C so, } {F uh, } we're -	26
[ I, + I ]  have absolutely no musical ability whatsoever,	24
{F Huh, }  yeah,	15
{F Uh, } [ the, + the ] thing that we like to do the most is to watch T V together.	24
{C so. } -	26
<Laughter>.	20
{C But } right now, the last things I watched regularly was THIRTY SOMETHING when it first came out.	24
{C and } do, -	26
I think that [ it, + ] thirty years ago, when, {F uh, } I was newly married, family was very, very important.	9
Yes.	36
Okay.	15
<Noise> Yeah.	15
{C And } sometimes that's a little hard with books and  music [ and, + and ] sheet music and  stuff you've got to work on, too.	22
<laughter> it amazed me when I got out here to the midwest and  found out that even though they're an hour earlier in time, they still watch the news when, -	24
Uh-huh.	15
Okay.	38
{F Uh, } my husband works for, {F uh, }  Texas Instruments.	24
Uh-huh.	15
# Uh-huh. #	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } [ it's just + -- -- it's ] really amazing how quickly that goes.	24
Uh-huh,	15
Oh.	15
[ {C and } + {C and } ] [ both of them are + both want ] the extent of extremes so that they don't give anything for a balance {D you know }	9
This, -	26
Yeah.	15
{C and } I [ went on, + went ahead ] and sold it.	24
{C But } [ yo-, + you ] got [ the, + the ] three fifty in the van?	7
{C and, } {F uh, } Bobby missed his whole junior year of high school --	24
{C or, } -	26
I learned something here.	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
{C and then } we were transferred back here,	24
((   ))  <laughter>.	20
{F Uh, } [ it's, + it's ] lower than it has been in the past.	24
Now what are they supposed to do?	39
{D Well, } of course, you've been at Clark enough that you know it's always cold <laughter>.	9
then they put it in the dump some place	9
[ I, + I ] can believe that.	24
Uh-huh,	15
{C so } there's a difference of my view there for those two. #	24
and, uh, -	26
-- [ [ It's, + it's, ] + it's, ] -	26
it's a guy.	24
I really enjoy that because it's kind of [ a, + a ] getaway type thing.	24
Yeah.	36
# Uh-huh. #	15
Back -- -- gone the full circle.	24
Oh.	15
it's great.	24
{C and } they're selling drugs --	24
right.	15
{C and } they don't know [ wh-, + what ] the heck they're doing.	24
(( {C but } just th- )) , -	26
<Cough>.	20
{D So, } {D so } what have you seen  lately that, {F um, } you think is worthwhile?	39
I like fish and chicken the most.	24
I {D actually } [ wa-, +  was ] planning a trip to Latin America	24
When my children [ wer-, + were  ] younger, of course, -	24
{F Oh, } I don't know, {F uh, }	19
{F Oh } okay,	29
# {C but } # they don't have to pay  all the taxes and so forth that we do.	24
I really tried to think of some other things	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
{C and } they wind up <breathing> back on the streets after five years or six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in Mesquite who was out in six months.  # <Breathing>. #	9
{D Well, } no fault's rather funny in Colorado, because it seems that <<pause>> everyone pays all the time -- -- instead of just the guilty party pays.	24
{F Uh, } [ if, + if ] we were talking about the money, {F uh, } I'd just have to say what they're spending is probably enough, simply because I don't know that much about it. {D You know } <laughter>.	24
[ with, + with ] other things going on, [ it, + it ] seems to have lessened,	9
no,	33
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah	15
let's take him home.	25
<laughter>.	20
{D Now } what happens is all those that don't have any money in the country move to the cities,	9
I read  about one or  two thick novels like that a year. {D You know, }	24
{C but } like you said the drug testing procedures need to be defined a little better.	9
<Laughter>.	20
<TV>.	20
<Laughter>.	20
I know, isn't that something --	16
New York.	29
I love watching a microbiologist fighting off with a policemen or something else,	24
That's cool.	21
[ {D well } that's, + {D well } that's ] funny.	21
[ Ex-, + exactly. ]	36
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] programs to, {F um, } -	26
{F Uh, } as far as capital punishment, [ on, + on ] it's own  merits, I have the trouble with the way it's applied.	24
# {D Well } # {C and } I would think, {D you know, } since big business is supposedly why the government makes the decisions they do -- -- {D you know, } [ the, + the ] people that work in big business have families --	9
{C and } my daughter's quite involved and all that sort of thing.	24
It was -- -- crowded.	24
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } yeah,	36
That's even harder.	24
Yeah,	26
of course you fill them all out because you're honored.	9
uh-huh.	15
Do you grow [ those, + those ]  ten, fifteen Y?	7
I hope, -	26
being involved in my organization, {F uh, } [ we, + we ] have deep background checks #	24
Uh-huh.	15
Like factory workers that have lots of accidents are now being drug tested.	24
You're really roughing it.	9
{F Oh, } of course not.	21
Uh-huh.	15
whatever one it was it was such a blockbuster seller.	24
Why I don't just write a check, I don't know.	24
# I like # to have them kind of tucked away.	24
{C but } she also was, {F um, } something like a, [ t-, + {F uh, } state ] auditor or something like that before this position.	24
Yeah.	15
{C And so, } as far as our bushes, we don't have any	24
Didn't want to talk about him because he didn't think he was such [ a, + {F uh, } a ] good action guy.	24
I'm sure.	9
<Cough>.	20
Yeah,	36
You have to start somewhere.	9
{D Well. } -	26
{D Well, } [ I've, + {F uh, } I've ] been caught with marijuana before,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } if that weren't so,  I would certainly have one.	24
Uh-huh.	15
A lot of [ those, + those ] in  [ [ the, + the  ]   Z, + {F uh, } the  Z  ] cars, the Datsun cars end up over the border,	24
that's supposed to be a real good statistic, {F uh. }	21
Little rock stars, put all them in there.	18
[ I, + I've ] seen a lot of people just say {D well, } {D you know, } he'll learn everything when he gets into, {F uh, } {D you know, } -	24
Uh-huh,	15
No,	33
-- {C or } this summer I went to Colorado --	24
Sure.	15
{C So } it's not really lucrative to take chances like that, {D you know, } even though [ it, + it ] does exist.	9
It sure is.	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I've always bought them new.	24
[ I, + I'm, ] Uh-huh.	13
That's right <breathing>.	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } I can't deal with opera at all.	24
it's a good place to go.	9
{C and } [ if, + if ] you  only, -	26
[ we, + I ] was out in Florida with a friend a while ago	24
Some of that opportunity for job change in the fact [ that, + that ] aspects changing.	9
{C And, }  {F uh, } a lot of people  [ just, + just ] wear jeans [ and, + and, ]  {F uh, } sweats all the time	24
{C And } it's real funny  because if you, {D you know, } -	26
# [ It's. # + It's  ] been [ a rough tow, + a rough road to hoe  ] ever since he left.	24
{F Huh. }	26
{C or } did he just do it?	7
it seems that what you really need to do to win though, is to have a team  that has reasonable talent and has some people that [ [ have, +  have, ] +  have ]  real breakthrough years.	9
[ Do you, + do you, ] {F um, }  receive a lot of information on skiing through the SKI MAGAZINE?	7
[ The, + the, ] -	26
it is.	36
# Uh-huh,	15
{C and }  it's sort of a  (( bone of contention ))  between she and my dad because my  dad said {D well, } just let me take it down there and find out what's wrong with it,	24
and, I, I just, you know, I just don't.	24
# Six foot,	30
the f-, -	26
{C and so } they have no one at home,	24
That was the first time I'd ever gotten any kind  of drug screening, {D you know. }  [ Was, + was ] going to Honeywell.	24
{F uh } ...	26
{C but } I think you can also get a bad education at public or private, {D you know, }	9
Latest I heard it was just going to be [ Russia that, + Russia itself that ] was going to have them.	24
<Lipsmack> <breathing> Why ((you asking)) <laughter>, -	26
Yeah.	15
{C and } [ I, + I ] read a lot for school	24
{C and } I've got better things to be doing than sitting here listening to this stuff over and over again.	25
{C So, } I had to check that [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } talk about it.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
I work at TEKTRONIX	24
{C and, } {F uh, } it's a pretty [ vicious, + {F uh, } vicious ] cycle.	9
{C And } what to do when they're faced with it.	2
{C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } we had a case like that here	24
Clothes,	30
That's right.	36
{D like } that boutique, {F um, } they take, {A {F oh } what was it, } twenty percent of the sell price.	24
Have they put the cap on the interest rates?	7
We have an I B M compatible.	24
# {D Well, } if I # had your address,  I would send you, -	24
or, -	26
{C and } she's in, {F uh, } grade school,	24
{F Oh, } {F um, } what do you do,	31
That just bothered me so much, especially, {D you know, } at my age,	24
Yeah <TV>.	36
Right,	36
{F Uh, } [ the, + {F uh, } the ] guy, {F uh, } apparently had [ a, + a, ] mental disfunction in which he needed to go out and just slay people. {F Uh, } just, {F uh, } kill them [ with, + with ] as much blood [ and, + and ] guts as possible.	24
It's rained (( )).	24
It's unbelievable.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Up north they just kind of throw them together.  Because we had homes built [ in, + in ] Detroit also,	9
{C and then } I quit and got disabused of that   notion <noise>.	24
{D Well, } except I know it would  just not be cost effective.	9
they don't  have as much money.	9
{C But } they just, {F um, } really take care of them, or, {F uh, } are protective of them.	24
It most certainly  is, [ so, +  {F uh, } so ] that, [ [ it, +  it ] was, +  it was ] certain things that were enjoyable about it,	9
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
I've never been out there,	24
# Right. #	36
Right.	36
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } okay <laughter>.	29
Oh, I know.	36
Have you ever been to Austin?	7
It got real cold,	11
{C and } I haven't figured out, -	24
is that so?	12
bye bye. #	38
{C And so, } in his case, he lost his whole career,	24
{C But } that was just me.	24
{C And } it did not work out.  {F Uh, } at all <laughter>.	24
Yeah,	36
{F Oh, } uh-huh.	15
She's not the one going to Washington, {F huh? }	7
# me too <laughter>.  #	24
Huh.	15
{F Um, } I think I'm down to one.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } then I think that's going to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do.	9
it would certainly be an interesting test --	24
we had [ a, + {F uh, } a ] turkey loaf.	24
Yeah.	15
I'm supposed to make a few calls.	24
Something happening to me at Christmas time [ that, + that ] verified to me that I will al-, -	24
{F Oh } yeah.	15
{C And } I didn't mind getting in the dirt there,	24
{C and } [ I just, + I think ]  he deserves a good break.	9
We have not taken our kids skiing or anything.	24
that, -	26
{D like } I was  [ do, +  just doing ] just the trim [ outs that, + ] around the doors and windows	24
I do too.	24
they can get more somewhere else.	9
<Lipsmack> {F Uh, } Jim Kelly.	24
I talked to someone that was only a couple of thousand in her town, I think.	24
{C and } I process some ratings  and [ put, + do ] graphics for their television stations, ((   ))  their clients,	24
They have a lot of vegetable to them,	9
I know.	21
{F Oh, } [ they, + they ] put, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
[ {C or } + {C and } ] you, by that day -	24
{C and } it happened to be my friend who lives <laughter> a few blocks away.	24
{C So } we kind of looked for [ where, + where  ] [ the, + {F uh, } his  ] office would be located	24
Right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
My, -	26
{C and } I always wish there was a balance, {D you know, } # with # the one [ and, + and ] wish she could spend more time with her kids	9
Yeah,	15
Yeah.	15
{C But } [ who wants to, + who wants to, ] {F um, } ride a bus?	16
{F Uh, } I really haven't thought about the topic of drug testing.	24
I think that really kind of developed a little bit later on,	24
I think everybody would feel it is same way if they were touched by crime.	9
-- {C so } she had to start all over again --	24
{C Or, } a lot of women I know now and [ my, + {F uh, } one of my ] supervisors, when she went on L O A to have her baby, we hooked up, {F uh, } {F uh, } a terminal at her house	24
[  It, + it's ] still got a long way to go.	9
[ I, +  I ] don't judge any war as good or   bad,	24
# I # stopped comparing myself a long time ago  to somebody who had, {F um, } -	24
Okay.	36
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh,	15
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } I know what I'm seeing here at [ m-, +  my ] job <talking> is that people are having their children much later in life -- -- # so # that they're establishing careers	24
{D Well, } down in Texas, {F uh, } {D you know, } [ little, + listen to a little ] country every now and then.	24
[ It, +  it ] just kind of depends  on [ what you're, +  what you're ] planting,	24
{D well }  they take on human characteristics  like, {F uh, } our other animal,	9
He will be able to, -	24
{F Uh, } I don't know.	19
{C and } she says, usually everybody shows up in exception to maybe one person,	24
Yes,	15
{D Well, } that's kind of the way we  (( were doing )) -	24
{D Well } [ [ I, + {D you know, } I, ] + I ] was never really a big Dallas fan -- -- until we moved here	24
{C and } they actually  had a conference.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
How many times have you talked?	39
{F Uh, } somewhat	11
{D Well, } [ {D so, } + {D so } ] that's another thing that has to adapt is, {D you know, } [ the, + the ] father's attitudes about, {D you know, } [ who, + whose ] job is this.	9
[ Would, +  {F uh, } would ]  you be more in favor of, {F uh, } {D you know, } {D like } a local, {F uh, } -	7
Uh-huh.	15
I have enjoyed talking with you, Kathy.	38
<Noise> <talking> Oh.	15
# {F uh, } # [ it's, + it's ] not the  ((  )) -	26
<Laughter>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
[ Like, + like  ] you say, [ [ it, + it,  ] + ] {D well, } transmissions and things like that. -	24
Yeah,	15
it's fun.	9
we're still pretty much, {D you know, } in winter, as far as that goes here.	24
Hi,	6
you're right there's a big change,	36
Yeah,	15
[ they, + they're ] always branded, {D you know, } as a bunch of outlaws	9
{C But } there's always a sale.	9
{C But, } <laughter> [ I, + I, ] -	26
{C but, } {E I mean, } other than that, {D you know, }  there seems to be a little in fighting going on between the producers and one of the actresses.	24
My name is Nola.	6
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
{D well } all their players are signed now.	24
Yeah.	15
I just started a new job and trying to get acclimated there.	24
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ] [ it really isn't, + for some people [ tha-, + ] who have been there for over, and over, and over, it really isn't, ] {F uh, } as bad.	24
{D You know, } I've seen that so many times, strawberries dipped in chocolate	24
{C and }  (( see a ))  credit card <laughter>.	25
Uh-huh,	15
{C and } I can see from her angle.	24
Oh.	15
{C and } it really feels similar to this -- -- during the summer.	24
It's  like if you tell us the answer to that you're telling our enemy what your strategy is.	24
You, {F uh, } have to learn,	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C So }  [ I, + I've ]  kind of, {F uh, } rationalized that [ it's, + it's ] probably a lot more  economical for us to just go rent the movies we want to see.	24
No,	33
# <Laughter>.  #	20
Yeah,	15
# Yeah	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C so } I love, {D you know, } baseball teams,	24
{C and } they have a bunch of computers leftover from that --	24
{F Oh } [ I, + I've ] got all four feet in the trough, {D you know, } being a federal employee.	9
{F Um, } let me see.	17
Uh-huh.	15
[ [ He, + he, ] + he's ] been helping me more,	24
Absolutely.	36
You see a lot more of the mothers and all saying to the young girls, # {D you know } # -- -- you can do it.	9
I know, I've been talking to people in Ohio, and, {F uh, } Virginia, and I think, California.	24
Yeah,	15
{C but } [ when you, + {D you know, } when you ] add up everything [ you've, + you've ] charged up on the Discover card for a year -- -	24
-- and so, with, -	26
# {C so, } # she is als-, -	24
{F Uh, } it seems to be that, {F uh, } gang warfare follows very rapidly on the heels of <noise> poverty conditions.	9
Uh-huh.	15
If someone was out to get you, I think that a company or a boss could use this.	9
# Yeah,	15
major <laughter>.	24
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } before I went into any of the interviews, {F uh, } they took me to the doctor to give me a physical.	24
I don't know, [ I, + ] anymore	24
yeah.	15
Yeah,	15
-- {D you know, } it  ] does go in cycles,    *[[ I would treat this as a continuation of B.26 utt2 and label it '+' ]]	24
Yeah	4
{F Oh, } that's a good place,	9
{C And } that's the best place that I've ever canoed.	24
cause [ [ we-, + we're, ] + {D you know, } we're ] talking about some peens that have just {D like } even gave up on {D like } getting it back and trying any  more.	9
{C And } I really don't want that to happen.	24
Okay.	38
{F Uh, } had a hamster or two,	24
{C And } I think it's an excellent movie for, -	9
# Did you hear my printer # in the background.	7
Yeah,	36
# Yeah. #	15
{F Oh, } uh-huh.	15
# Proper interface.  #	22
{C and, } {F uh } -- -- there's a lot of different things that they do, lot of different divisions [ even this area, + in the San Francisco Bay Area ] that they do,	24
Thank you very much.	42
Cool,	21
# exactly. #	36
I really don't know.	24
{C but } he's really from France,	24
Yeah.	15
{C cause } there's always that opposite story there.	9
Right.	15
It's only their top ones that go on, like ours do.	9
You guys central?	7
{C and } I've been sweaty,	24
{C So } this is a topic of personal interest.	8
{C and } I subscribe to the paper on the weekends.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D well, } -	26
{D Now, } yes,	13
{F Huh. }	26
{C but } [ I just, + I can't ] bring myself to trust [ this, + this ] company who is trying to do this or whatever it is, {D you know, }	24
Uh-huh.	15
<Noise>.	20
yeah.	36
Oh.	15
{C and } no other  responsibilities for yourself, I guess, {D you know, }  it's, [ [ I can, I can, + ] + I've ] been pretty happy,	24
Okay.	13
{C And } they-, -	26
Uh-huh.	36
Uh-huh.	15
I agree with you.	36
{F Um. }	26
We don't have that much.	24
{F Oh, } boy.	21
[ That + ] he looks at the things that he eats	24
<<pause>> what else have I done <laughter>?	1
I guess our youngest one now is five --	24
{C But, }  {F uh, } of course I'm away from my other son those hours, too.	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C and so } this past couple months have been really hectic	24
you can't, -	26
it's more, c-, -	26
{C but } what they do is, {F uh, }  if, {D you know, } you apply [ [ for, +  for  ] + to ] get [ a, + a ] insurance policy -- -- they'll, {F uh, } check to see if you're H I V  positive	9
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } as far as, -	26
{C and } they would talk about exercise and just  general things relating to the birthing process.	24
{C And } he takes [ GAMES MAGAZINE -- + -- GAME MAGAZINE, ] which has puzzles and things -- -- that he likes to solve, {D you know, }  crosswords and various logic puzzles and things like that --	24
#Uh-huh.#	15
Okay,	29
# Do you # -- -- get [ wh-, + ] {D like } one of  [ the talk stations, +  the news stations? ]	7
# right. #	15
Well, course, see, I listen to K V I L for the contests.	24
yep,	4
[ I think, + I think ] the stand they have, [ or, + or ] the way the  command respect, [ I, + I ] support that.	9
Uh-huh.	15
# [ [ To, + to what, ] + {F uh, } to, ] -	26
{F Uh, } I, -	26
{C and } they showed {D like } what they thought an opera would  be,	24
{C And, } {F uh, } I've noticed over the past say, maybe five or six years, {F uh, } -	24
[ {C but, } +  {F uh } -- -- {F uh, } {C but } ] I do listen to that talk show.	24
{C But } I see that to be a potential power problem later, with, {F um, } who's going to be in charge with this new  world order.	24
[ Is that, + is that ] the Dodge Caravan, that does that	7
I really hope they do that in Louisville.	24
yeah,	15
{C and } the boys are in baseball.	24
who knows.	16
{F Uh, } we are, I guess,  the only one of the major Western nations currently with capital punishment.	9
{F Uh, } books,	24
what kind of things do you like to do in your spare time?	39
[ I, + I ] think, -	26
# Yeah. #	15
[ {C or, } + {C but } ] there were very few women in business at that time.	24
{D well, } yeah,	36
exactly.	36
# I # think it's a marvelous idea [ when you think of, + {F uh, } when I just think of  ] the papers that I dump out --	9
it doesn't require <laughter> a lot of thinking,	24
Right <laughter>.	15
# {E I mean, } # [ forge-, + ] it's supposed to save you money	9
They seem just to be so chocked full [ of, + of  ] ads.	9
{C because } down in east Texas there's a lot of red clay.	24
# {D Well, } {F uh, } # not only that, -	40
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } [ [ the old -- + -- the old ] Apple, + {F uh, }  [ the, + the ] original Apple  ] had, [ what, + ] [ yeah, + ] forty-eight I guess, didn't it.	7
it's pretty slow.	9
Doug, you want to start?  <Laughter>.	18
Wow.	21
{C and } [ they, + they've ] actually started doing something.	24
Yeah,	36
Yeah,	15
He's eleven.	24
[ He's, + {C because } he'll ] talk about the other guys he plays with doing that -- -- and how immature he thought it was and stuff.	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
believe it or not though [ the, + all the ] women that stay home are real busy when they are home.	9
{C and, } -	26
{F Uh, } are you saying you don't think  anything should be done in the short term?	7
Uh-huh.	15
I just couldn't believe it.	24
{C But, } {F um, } otherwise, I'm not aware of any problems with the benefits around here <<pause>>.	24
{D So } you graduated from which high school?	39
-- {C and } a lot of the kids weren't as fortunate  as say, my brother and I were,	24
Right <laughter>,	36
My husband, on the other hand, was not very close to his family.	24
That's -- -- what she plans to do.	24
{C and } that's it.	9
{D Well, } [ that, + that ] says a lot [ for the, + for his ] ability, though I think. For Staubach's, {E I mean. }	24
{D Well, } [ leg-, + legally  ] {D now } they're not allowed,	24
{F Oh, } really?	12
Not anymore.	24
# Yeah.  #	15
{F uh, } [ to try to, + to try to ] provide efficient transportation from everywhere around [ the, + the ] metroplex [ to, + to, ] {F uh, } both those centers [ of, + of ] business plus everything else that's scattered around here and there as opposed to having a concentrated business area. {D You know, } like New York does, -	9
{C But, } {F uh, } we get, {F uh, } -	26
{C but } usually the size, {D you know, } of, {F uh, } [ tiny, + tiny ] pebbles.	24
{C and then, } of course, take care of the house  {C [ a-, + and ] } all this good kind of stuff.	24
just something you do everyday.	22
{C and, }  {F uh, } we used to overhaul farm tractors basically,	24
# Yeah. #	15
it was [ an in-, + ] kind of indoor, outdoor,	24
I guess it's on late Saturday nights or something,	24
Yes.	15
[ W-, + ] -	26
Texas, I saw on T V the other night, [ is the, + has had ] forty-six in like the past several years.	24
{C but } when [ they, +  the family ] came in to  see him, they had not been made aware,	24
{D you know, } a lot of my friends have  [ a + ] taken us down, the stance of, {D you know, } these people are just trying to be free and trying to get away	24
-- [ we, + we ] call them native pecan trees	24
Yeah,	36
You're in New York?	7
[ {C and } it's certainly, + {C and } it's certainly ] been going on over there for hundreds of years.	9
{D Well, } how neat.	21
{C and } he has always kept that.	24
I've seen my uncle and his family, {D you know, }  does everything together,	24
-- {C so, } you can bring them,	24
Exactly.	36
it was even Mennonite related,	24
{C But } she's had really good luck.	24
It was already setup when we bought it.	24
[ i-, + this was in ] a bathroom too.	24
our favorite, -	26
{C and. } -	26
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Was that pretty funny?	7
{C Because } [ of, + of ]  their, {D you know, } -	24
# {F Uh, } [ what # about, + what about, ] {F uh, }  lesser, {F uh, } benefits perhaps for you but  [ for, + for ] the women [ in the, + in the ] corporation.	31
Uh-huh.	15
So, that's a possibility.	9
they stash away a good bit of money and come down here	24
for that you put, -	24
<Cough> <<someone else in the room>>.	20
<Laughter> No more for me.	24
Huh-uh.	33
There is also people that are getting off drugs and trying to do better with their lives.	9
[ that's, + that's  ] interesting.	9
Oh.	15
Yeah.	15
# {C and } # [ all, + all ] my friends are really anxious, {D you know, } to have the homemade noodles	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } now it's election time again	24
{D Well, } very well, {F um, }	9
that sort of thing,	24
Anyway, {D well, } you have a good day.	38
Yeah,	15
-- {C but } I would pay all of them  at one sitting	24
I think, {F uh. }	26
until, -	26
{C and } my [ future, + future ] sister-in-law's mother does that too, # full-time. #	24
I think there are certain things that,  {F uh, } the jury can determine as far as, {F uh, } guilty or not guilty,	9
Huh.	15
{C so } I don't know.	24
{F Oh, } # okay. #	29
Yeah.	36
# Uh-huh. #	15
Very very corrupt, like the Panamanians [ are, + were ] very corrupt.	9
That's true,	36
{C And then } you just use your right hand with the hook.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	36
{C But } you're not living there right now.	8
{F Oh } <laughter>.   If you have your health, you're wealthy.	9
we probably should,	24
I want something that I can just take them  and serve them while they're sitting in front of the T V.	24
# Right. #	15
<Laughter>  Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } I think that it's just people have got to be aware.	9
{C but } they can, {F uh, } of course, -	24
even families that don't have child care, -	24
[ {D Well, } + {D Well, } ] do you think that that maybe, -	7
{C And } I have, -	24
For East Texas or something?	7
[ What, + what ] attracts you to the Saturns?	39
{C and  then } you take and make [ a, +  a ] dressing out of, {F uh, } Russian dressing, one bottle of that -- -- and a package of Lipton Onion Soup mix -- -- and three ounces of apricot preserves --	24
Uh-huh.	15
# {C but, } # God this is much better than west Texas.	9
{C And } do we have enough, {D you know, } {F um, } <lipsmack> food storage, and  enough, {F uh, } batteries and -- -- all the kinds of things.	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } we didn't, {D you know, } -	24
you're right <laughter>.	36
{C but } I know [ they let you, + they'll let you ] decrease how many hours you work by (( )) kind of percentage.	24
{E I mean, } [ you, + you ] read about [ the, + the ]  [ (( fairly )) , + fairly  ] stiff laws they put in on cars now [ they're, + they're ] enforcing.	24
It is having a good moral background.	9
{F Oh, } okay.	29
It's [ a + ] real short,	24
{C and } I just cannot understand why they're just happy to spend their time here rather than produce, {D you know, }	24
You could just visualize everything.	24
# {E I mean, } # it's kind of like,  {D you know, } {F um, } soap opera # I guess. #	9
No,	33
{F Oh, } you said you had some people from California.	24
it's a real mixture,	24
{F Oh, } really?	12
{F Um } -- -- I would be afraid of that.	24
T I is very good, {F uh, } has done a lot of experiments in the [ speech, + {F uh } -- -- speech, ] {F uh, } [ synthesis, + synthesis, ]	24
{C So }  she [ wor-, + ] {D you know, } goes in early  those days and works {D like, } {D you know, } noon til  close.	24
Hi.	6
[ There, + there ]  was one site that they cleaned up	24
no,	32
Yes,	15
{C So, }  it's pretty nice.	24
like RAMBO and all that. -	24
{C so } she's gone a lot at nights	24
I like that, too.	36
{C and } yet [ he, + he ]  did wind up having to make a choice.	24
if I was looking for outside care I probably would stay away from professional  child care centers and try to find, if I was close to home, relatives or people with  [ it is + ] same values and possibly religious faith or something similar so that she would be raised  in an environment that would be similar to what we would have in our own homes [ as, + as ] parents.	24
{C but } [ we, + we ] don't a whole lot,	24
Right.	15
as far as -	26
# {C and } they # stopped doing it because they said it wasn't profitable.	24
{C and } they said, {D well, } you don't have to pay for it yet.	24
{D Well, } story and a half, really, because we had a basement.	24
it's not.	24
{F Uh, } {C and } occasionally I do order things from catalogs -- -- over the phone.	24
yeah.	36
and go, {D Well, } what the heck, we'll talk for a while.	24
Uh-huh.	15
I enjoy it.	24
{C and } I think now that the weather's getting nicer we're going to start doing it again and occasionally go walking.	24
[ I, + ] and, {D you know, }  even hobbies and crafts and sewing things like  that, [ I, + I ] think gee, I could do this or that,	24
I was thinking maybe need to learn to quilt.	24
We're pushing real hard though.	24
Yeah.	4
I happen to, {F um, } <lip_smack> -	24
I had talked with my parents.	24
you feel squeezed in the middle of having both generations,	9
{D So. } {D Now } have you been to Applebee's.	8
{C but } down here, Louisiana has a bad reputation for their politicians and all.	24
{F Uh } yeah.	4
All right.	15
You still have relatives back there	8
I don't,	24
Uh-huh.	15
I know, {F um, }	24
One time two of them came at once	24
I don't like the Chevies as much as I like  the Fords.	9
I'm working two jobs,	25
Yeah.	36
{C So } do you know of any other shows in the even, or something that you enjoy?	31
{F Oh, } {F um, } let me see, {F uh, } for New Year's we went to eat at Uncle Julio's.	24
They look like they've got, -	24
{C and } we'll, {F uh, }  take all of those back and try to recycle them.	25
Yeah,	4
{C and } you just tune it out because it's the same thing	9
I hear that's the one that you really need to see at the theater instead of home video <throat_clearing>.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } I lived in Missouri and then in Utah	3
and that's not necessarily the answer either	9
{C so, } That's just too far away.	24
Lots of little restaurants, too, with home cooked food, that's up there.	24
some people, -	26
Bye.	38
it seems like,	24
{C so, } -	26
Yeah,	4
{C so } here they based their sentencing thinking that this was this guy's first offense,	24
# Right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
<Smack>  {C So } I don't have a fear of fire arms in any respect.	24
fresh tomatoes.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Um, } do you do much camping?	7
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } {F uh, } half the countries of the world  simply canceled the Poland debts to help them.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } they were comparing test scores between private schools and  public schools,	24
{D like } tonight I only went for thirty minutes,	24
Right.	15
{C and } {F uh, } <noise>  it was quite a drag <noise> because, {F um, } <noise> we got them in our  house,	24
Yeah.	15
Are you at work?	7
-- # they must be trying to keep track of #  , {D you know, } who is doing it, or  what, I guess.	24
She twirls a baton	24
<Laughter> Alright.	15
{C and, } uh-huh.	26
{C And  then, } *[[needs slash mark]] Yeah.	13
Yeah.	15
{C and } you get to choose your boss.	24
{C and so, } I guess it depends, {F um, } if there are some statistics that show [ that, + {F uh, } that ] people, {F uh, } commit crimes on the spur of the moment.	9
<Throat_clearing> {F Uh, } they're certainly all leaders	9
Uh-huh.	15
actually [ [ it had been, + {F uh, } it would have been, ] + it had been  ] a repaint job.	24
Yes,	36
It's wonderful.	24
{F Oh, } these little things are so cute, though, {D you know. }	9
Yeah.	15
that's very nice <laughter>.	21
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } at least, as I said, you can always say no thank you <laughter>.	9
Pennsylvania.	24
{D Well, } that's good.	21
{C And } it's a small office that she works in --	24
Yeah,	15
{C So, } I try not to, {D you know, } -	24
{C or } you just like it?	35
Maybe because I'm easily confused by detail.	24
{C but } what about the rest of the society,	12
{C And } I know they have to be coming from my charge cards, {D you know. }	24
<Buzz>.	20
{C and } sometimes, {F uh, } we, pull,	24
{C and then, } {D you know, } you see it when it first comes out if you really want to see it	9
Yeah.	15
[ [ It's, + {D you know, } it's, ] + it's ]  about the [ same, + {F uh, } same ] distance from here [ to s-, + to San ] Antonio as it is -- --  from there to Sacramento.	24
# Yeah. #	15
All right.	15
[ I, + I ]  should imagine [ [ that, + that, ] + that ] [ what the, + what the ] problem, -	9
{C So. } {E I mean, } they're hitting us up,	9
{C And, } I've applied at another district where  many of the children are Asian.	24
It's not as comfortable a living for me.	24
{C and, }  {F um, } I'm working at a day care right now.	24
{F um, } is there anything you can do about that like -- -- give out a phony phone number?	7
It is expensive.	9
{F Um, } the rest of it we just do because <laughter> my husband has become hooked on recycling.	24
I've only been up there once.	24
{E I mean, } certain things really do need to be done whether  or not you think they should, be or not <laughter>.	9
[ we,  + {C so } we ]  kept very much abreast of what was going on.	24
I see.	15
[ that's, + that ] would be good.	21
huh-uh	33
{F Oh, } about two years.	24
[ {C and } + -- -- {C and, } ] {F uh, } {D you know, } [ we, + I ]  think as a family we're a lot better off.	24
It must have been just [ so much, + so much ] work <noise>.	9
Yeah,	4
[ I, +  I ]  think that doesn't really have that much to do with, {F um, }  unless they've  done something really horrible, {D you know, } or something real abnormal.	9
{C And } [ I, + {F uh, } I've ] been trying to get my wife to go with me to go see it.	24
I don't either <laughter>.	24
#  Yeah,	26
<Child_talking> I've never heard of anything like that.	24
{F uh, } HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS -- -	24
Yeah.	15
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah.	4
You have any idea.	7
# the basic family is not there # anymore.	9
Uh-huh.	15
That's true.	36
{C and } she's lived there [ for +  {D like, } {F oh, } off and on for ] twenty years.	24
Huh-uh.	15
{F Um, } yeah,	36
[ [ the guy, +  the guy ]  that played in it, + {A he was not the star, } {C but } the one that played in it ] that I liked best  was the one who was in, {F uh, } <sigh> {F oh, } the one about the old people.	24
{C and, } That's a good family place to go,	9
exactly.	36
{C so } I'll talk with you later.	38
{C and } they do the work	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } wow.	21
# Yeah. #	36
-- Uh-huh.	36
{C and } if that's the case,  then you have to get your car fixed,	24
{D well, } we, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } {C so } I guess I have a left over positive feeling about the question even though I don't know very much about Puerto Rico.	24
{C and } -- -- from listening to that, I kind of got an idea that  I thought would be good with <sniffing>	24
I had a pet when I was a girl.	24
-- # that's good, #	21
Then again [ the, + the ] community college system here is excellent for the dollar spent,	9
I think that they should be put away.	9
{D Well, } I have got a dog now	24
Yeah.	36
{C but } I figured the sand and all, # had # that delivered and, # leveled # it [ and, + and, ] # placed # most all the bricks.	24
Yeah,	15
I think I am getting a call coming in.	24
When you call the eight hundred number, they assign you a topic and, {F uh, } pretty, {F uh, } cut and dried <laughter>.	24
[ {C And, } +  {C and } ] they, -	26
it just got {D like } the top rating.	24
that's true.	9
what they said is that this area has had its summer weather in the spring.	24
It is really scary,	24
(( {C and } they're ones were )) -	9
Okay.	13
Uh-huh.	15
that teapot dome scandal is [ when + {A I think during the Hoover years } where ] gobs of land [ was, + was ] sold at really inflated prices on the theory that there were natural gas beneath it,	24
[ That's the, + that's the ] thing I hate most about entertaining is thinking of what I'm going to serve.	24
<laughter> I'm sort of a very big TWIN PEAKS fan,	24
{C and } there is  not going to be anything left of Iraq at all <noise> <<sounds like zipping>>.	9
I think that when children are small, I think it's okay for women to work especially,	9
Okay,	29
because it sure looks like that's going to be you-, you know, the big thing for a long time.	9
let's see.	17
[ [ I, + I, ] + like I ]  say, I don't have any problem with people using firearms, {D you know, }  for sporting purposes or hunting purposes,	24
And, {A {F oh, } my God, } all this Civil War pride.	24
No?	12
{E I mean, } prison is such a waste of a human being.	9
You don't have the right to interfere in somebody's life.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } I went to a seminar,	24
{C And } I finally went back in and started looking at it myself.	24
<Laughter>.	20
I see,	15
{C so } that <noise>, -	26
Okay,	15
{F Uh, } we'll go get pizza [ and, + ] {F uh, } at Little Caesar's, although the kids prefer Domino's.	24
[ the, + the ] thing for me is, who sets the parameters or who has the control, {D you know. }	16
{C and } they range from probably ten to sixteen pounds --	24
-- you just lay around, {F uh, } that's the fastest way to die, I think, {D you know. }	9
How about you guys?	31
Yeah.	15
yeah.	15
Where did you go?	39
yeah <laughter>.	26
{C and } they were playing in the back yard	24
absolutely.	36
[ if, sh-, + if it ] doesn't she could easily put it on.	24
{E I mean, } {F um, } that made me think of, {F uh, } when our daughter was looking at colleges, we visited a campus in, {F um, } Saint Louis	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ I, + I ]  guess it's where we have to be, [ where it, + ] <static> we have to keep raising them  [ for + ] to keep  some of the things [ that, + that ] we have and <sniffing>. <Children> It's just scary though about, {D you know. } -	9
a few girls that I've gone out with, I've had, {F uh, } {D like }  Mazda R X seven's and stuff	24
that's right.	21
{E I mean, } {D you know } <laughter>.	26
{E I mean } [ they're a, +  it's a ] small market	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
I don't enjoy that at all -- -- when they're just talking about, {D well, } I'm better than you, and blah, blah, blah.	24
{F huh, } I guess if I had to pick a favorite team, any more, as well as, -	24
Okay.	29
{C but } that state income tax is just eating me alive.	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } another thing is the thing  seems to get, -	26
I got to take care of a friend of mine's dog.	24
I know it,	21
if it is performed correctly or if it's done right, or if the version is done right, I like it <laughter>,	24
No,	33
To see how that's, -	26
{F Uh, } do you also get dental?	7
# {C so } # I'll tell them that	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ I, + I ] try to avoid making anything that, too fancy, that, we'd like too much and eat too much <laughter>.	24
Yeah,	4
{C and, } -	26
it seems to, -	9
in fact it seems {D like } it's kind of like anything  goes now,	9
<Laughter> Yeah.	15
I caught the end of that.	24
Yeah.	15
It is some type of lily.	9
{C because } [ we're both, + my husband and I are  ] vegetarians.	24
-- {C but } I just felt like, {D well } at least I did something.	24
[ {E I mean, } tha-, + {E I mean, } I'm ] talking about the whole middle ea-,	24
that I felt was invasion because it was the same carpet place, and called me three times.	24
the nursing homes, when I was working in them, were very much understaffed, very much, {F uh, } in need of good personnel. {F Uh, }	24
Yeah.	4
{F Uh, } it's called Paveway.	24
Yes	4
{D well } a while back I was more into basketball --	24
I would think for your parents [ it would be, + it would still be ] hard even nowadays, {E I mean, } just to raise twelve kids.	9
{F Uh, } what are the ages of  your kids then?	39
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] [ this is, + {E I mean } there are ] streets just called restaurant rows	24
{D Well, } I tell you what,	13
The kids only wear name brand things # to school	24
Huh-uh.	15
They won in a squeaker.	24
No,	32
-- {C so } that might be why I look for inexpensive places -- -- just because we're eating out probably five nights a week -- -- maybe.	24
Yeah.	15
{F Uh, }  {C because } [ the, + the ] system is setup where it won't have any emissions.	24
that's right.	15
Yeah.	15
{D You know, } prefabs and all that stuff	24
{C and } they said [ that the, + {F uh, } that the ] pollution would not go high enough.	24
{C and } that God would move in that sovereignly,	9
It curbs the appetite  and helps with the calories and all that stuff.	9
Uh-huh.	15
I just wasn't [ in, +  in ] shape.	24
{C but } now that she has one,	24
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] they've got pebbles in their yard because <laughter> [ they can't, + almost nobody ] there [ has, + has ] lawns.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } -	26
{E I mean, } [ they eat, + they eat ] a lot of carbohydrates, and not much fat. {F Um, } for economical reasons, not for preference.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } what does the foliage look like?	39
I'll bet that was the case  of [ the, + the ] war in the Middle East.	9
{C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } having [ that, + that, ] {F uh, } gung ho plan -- -- {F uh, } that's, {D you know, } setting their life goals.	9
Uh-huh.	15
<<talking to someone off the phone>> What do you get for the tickets, if you bring stuff?	10
Yeah.	36
{C so } she had to go, I guess, get a real job <Laughter>.	24
{C so } I guess [ I, + I ] feel like as long as we have the possibility for this large numbers of people to be protected the possibility exist for these sorts of problems.	9
{C because, } {D see, }  {D well, } {E I mean, } in the whole spectrum I'd rather listen, {D you know, } -	26
Judith Krantz?	8
{D Well, } I'd be curious as to what the, {F uh, } requirement for [ a, + an ] acquittal is.	17
{C and } the-, -	26
{F Uh, } I really think it should be, except as I've mentioned twice now, in the specified industries -- -- [ or, + or ] jobs, because there are certain things where it's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times.	11
they were.	24
Reading is a little bit easier to work around.	9
{C and } she said, I don't think he's sick, I think she's pregnant, <laughter>.	24
Right.	15
# <Laughter>  We'll # have some interesting discussion, I guess.	9
((Before)) the one will take, -	13
{D Well, } {F uh, } guess it's logical to ask,  do you exercise any?	7
{C And  so } I do that.	24
Yeah.	15
# Really?	12
That would be great.	21
It was a little strange, {D you know, }	24
Right,	36
there's less criminals that are, {D you know, } turning themselves in, or, {D you know, } pleading {C or } whatever, because they know that the judge, {D you know, } if they find them guilty [ is, +  {D you know, } has ] [ the, + the ] opportunity to sentence them, {D you know, } [ for, + for ] the death sentence.	9
{F Uh, } just ten months.	24
{C and } it's going to be worse.	9
{C and then } there's other departments -- -- that aren't.	24
-- {C and then } we divvy them up between our four pay checks.	24
{C And, } {D well, } when we leave the doors open, they fly in the house.	24
Yeah,	38
Uh-huh.	15
<Sniffing>.	20
{C and } {E I mean, } # {E I mean, } I don't know how you and  your husband are, too,	24
Yeah,	36
{C So } [ I would, + {F uh, } I would ] <dishes> vote for her,	24
-- {C but } I think more than that,	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } they have, to be taught the language and customs  and all those kinds of things,	24
{C but } it's basically a nursing home too,	24
{C but } as far as the costs for  what your getting, {F uh, } the longevity of the house [ is not, + {F uh, } is not ] worth it.	9
About how much do they charge to do something like that,	39
{C But. } -	26
I wasn't with G S I, but I was connected with, {F uh, } {F uh, } oil, {F uh, } # exploration.  #	24
that's what I learned a lot of languages on, was an Apple two E in my high school.	24
I have a lot of, {F uh, } {F uh, }  computer books that -	24
Pardon me?	14
{F Oh, } oh.	15
{C And } now, we're out running around,	24
# {C but } # <breathing>  [ we, + we ] never have really planned a vacation around, {F uh, } places to go hiking.	24
Kind of like K Mart -- -- except it's a little better than what K Mart sells, I think.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } my husband's grandmother is, -	24
yeah.	15
{C So, } I don't know how the U. S. would cope with, {F uh, } a new state that is so very, very poor.	24
it explains [ why they, + why they  ] have everything white	9
we weren't that careful,	24
{D So, } {F uh, } that's the type, -	26
we have the largest murder rate of any developed, {F uh, } -	9
Where do you buy your tole painting  paints at around here?	38
{C and } [ I, + I ] feel like just saying, {F uh, } safe sex is not the answer.	9
Yeah	15
# No, #	36
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } I love it <laughter>.	24
Sure.	15
I guess I was lucky, because I was teaching,	24
{C but } {F uh, } once I get to that stage where I'm not paying for something else -- -- and, {F uh, } I don't have to worry about a lot of other scheduling things, where I've actually got the time to go out and enjoy it, {F uh, }  I might do something differently.	24
{C and } I think that was just through experiencing contacting college and the fact that I found [ it, + it  ] very relaxing for me.	24
he was just getting real skinny. <<voices fade out.>>	24
[ [ the + {F um } th- ] + the ] {F uh } Christian {F uh } point [ is + is ] always the point of {D well } it's at conception	24
{C and } I -- -	26
Yes.	15
Yeah.	15
I used to watch  DALLAS, years ago.	24
{F Uh, } {C and } it's supposed to rain tomorrow	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And then } once in a while I'll pick up a WORKING WOMAN or  something and -- -- realize why I don't want to [ re-, + ] go back to work <laughter>. What I enjoy about staying home.	24
We did a lot of stuff like that -- -- [ with, +  {F uh, } <breathing> with ]  our kids.	24
I don't care [ if, + if ]  they've got to go down into New Mexico to get it	9
{C and } all you had to do is just get your share of those # adopted # -- -- in the individual school districts.	24
{C and, }  {F uh, } <lipsmack> when, {F uh, } -	26
It should begin [ and + ] right down in the first grade.	9
I guess you know enough to look where you're walking or sitting -- -- or whatever you're doing.	8
{F Uh } <breathing> I'd be satisfied with [ a, + a ] good front wheel drive car when it comes time to replace the Sentra.	24
It took me about two weeks to realize, that was real lonely.	24
We might have to, {D you know, }  just be able to, -	9
# {C And } {F Um } # I believe that the idea of burning the flag is is in -	9
{C and } you are still going to have a flaky pie crust.	24
[ It's, + it's ] to bad because  it's, {F uh, } {E I mean, } [ th-, + ] just even the random occurrences where, {D you know, }  it's unsafe for a woman just to walk from the car to the, some, in certain areas like [ from the car, + from their car ] to the mall or something -	9
<Laughter.>	20
{C So } how much room do you have?	39
right	36
that was my, -	26
About all I can say is I guess about picking  schools, {F um, } I guess, {F uh, } if you don't know what you're going to do, liberal arts program  is a good idea.	9
I don't know what kind of a area Virginia Beach is,	24
Did they have to cast it?	7
<Laughter>.	20
The Rocky Mountains?	8
Right.	15
{E I mean, } you don't expect to make any money out of it.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C But, } {F uh, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
[ {C but, } + {C or, }  ] {D you know, } if you want to have open windows, to be able to op-, -	24
[ I, +  I ] really do.	24
I don't know,	19
[ {C but, } + {F um, } {C and } ] what else, {F um, }	17
{C and, } {F uh, } [ it, + it, ] -	26
<laughter>  [ [ [ I, + {F uh, } I, ] + {E I mean, } ] +   I ] can relate to that because [ I'm, + I'm ] going to college right now,	24
# Yeah,	4
{C and } we went camping on vacations.	24
{F Oh, } another show I like to watch is MASH.	24
Their Springs and Summers are pretty mild, too.	24
How much was the alternator?	39
{C and } you beat this cornstarch right into [ the mil-, +  the milk, ] {D you know, }	18
Yeah.	15
{C but } he controls that part	24
{C so } I've seen, a lot of mo-, -	24
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
[ I, + I ] absorbed all of that movie in one sitting.	24
Not vote.	24
Huh-uh.	15
# Bye. #	38
{C because } [ he's, + {D you know, } he's ] a really nice guy	24
{C and } there's a lot of crappie in there now.	24
{C but } I'd like to stay at home with  them until they get [ in, + at least into ] kindergarten, where they're at school from what, eight to three  or something	24
Yeah.	36
We like to [ put our, + just put our ] newspapers in a paper bag, {D you know, } and then carry them up there that way.	24
{D Well, } I think it was, {F uh, } thought up when there was    so much controversy about reviving a draft	24
Right,	15
{F Oh, } okay.	29
not that I think he was good looking,	24
That's where I'd like to go.	24
{F Uh, } do you sell them?	7
{C and } I was kind of horrified.	24
{F Uh, } {D you know, } just finger hopping.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
Yeah,	36
{C but } # -- -- <lipsmack> we have gone on trips where we bathed in streams.	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	4
Seems like sometimes hobbies do that.	9
[ I, + at least what I ] hear on that one, that it's coming out a second time [ in a, + in a ] longer version -- -- even though it was a long movie.	24
Yeah,	4
{C And } the shock on the system [ is, + is ] just too much,	24
{C and } it was beautiful.	9
It's in Massachusetts.	24
-- {C and } I, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
Oh.	15
<Breathing>.	20
I haven't,	24
{C and } I brought him in because he's just a wet mess out there	24
{D Well, } that's true.	36
Exactly.	36
{C and } I think, God, {D you know, }  [ I, + I ] should be able to do things like this <laughter>.	24
I just wondering are you an  ((   )) ,	7
Uh-huh.	15
I think the scenery kind of, -	9
# I don't think so. #	5
families seem to migrate towards [ one, + one ] room and carry on most of their activities  there,	9
{C but } we have usually just a pocket of really bad hot and really bad cold.	24
You can't trust anybody.	9
{C so } [ I, + I've ] seen that as a problem.	24
Uh-huh.	15
You want to do the one who can do the most good.	9
I was kind of into it for a while there.	24
I don't know what the, {D you know, } limits are.	24
a girl, one's in college, -	24
the funny thing there is they're not particularly welcome back home because  [ there's, + ] they're having housing shortages now.	9
Right.	15
{D So } we don't use it for things like our accounts and addresses and things like that.	24
Do you exercise on a regular basis?	7
{C and  so } they just notify everyone by mail,	24
{C and } the emergency room was like a bad comedy show <laughter>.	24
because it doesn't matter how restrictive you're border control points are	9
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
Well, as much as I'd, uh, I'd like to say that I'll be looking for a flashy convertible or, uh, or a four by four or something,	24
{C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } colds and things like that <laughter> get -- -- spread real easy and things,	24
Course, I feel the same way on the AIDS problem.	24
A friend of mine had a big family reunion a couple of years ago	24
No,	33
Uh-huh.	15
I'll have to try that.	24
Then that's, {F uh, } kind of  a private organization,	8
{F Oh, } {F Oh, } yeah,	36
{C and so } I grew up in the midst of civil rights movement. {F Uh, } in a pretty liberal family [ for, + for ] that area at the time.	24
I know <laughter>.	36
{C But } I was kind of odd because as a general rule the people that married during my time, they had kids within a year.	24
{C So, } that was kind of funny.	24
Yeah.	36
{C But } it's easy to find a contractor  for a couple of hundred bucks who'll sign it and let you do it --	9
{C so } [ it's very, + # it's very ] difficult to say that this teacher is doing a better job than this other one, other than I guess [ how, +     {D you kn-, } how ] a person scores in the beginning before the class and then after the class.	9
That's the first time I'd seen it.	24
Yeah.	15
Uh-oh.	21
when I think of drug testing, I'm thinking of the, {D you know, } outside of education.	24
me too,  {F uh, }	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D well, } yes I do.	4
[ it's +  {D like } I ] don't know when the police has their project going	24
Yeah.	4
[ it, + it ] basi-, -	26
we're spending too much money on the programs and not spending enough money on the earth that we have here.	24
{D so. } -	26
[ I, + I ] always # wondered about that myself.	24
{C Because } I, -	26
China painting and ceramics.	24
{C and then, } {D you know, } it came out that he was being framed,	24
right.	36
Yeah.	15
right.	36
that would be a problem <laughter>.	9
{C And, } {F uh, } I thought of those two things when [ I was, + I was ] holding for a long time.	24
{C but } I am staying <children_talking> in Minneapolis for a year	24
{C but } they geared it down so the motor spins really fast -- -- so it's got, to spin for very long,	24
they have things for kids to do.	24
{C So, } {F uh, } {D you know, } they are getting away from the styrofoam,	24
uh-huh.	36
{E I mean, }  {E I mean, }  you have murders	9
people are forced to sort of take all different kinds of classes here, which I think is wonderful.	9
{C and } it's an adventure <laughter>.	24
Michael Landon.	24
{C And } I was the only Jew both nights.	24
I go no,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } that, {F uh, } -	26
# Yeah. #	15
I don't usually have time to read the newspaper  everyday,	24
{C and } he was stationed in Panama,	24
I don't know	19
Uh-huh.	15
that is about the only, {F uh, } show I have seen where every time they sit down at the table, they pray -- -- before they eat.	24
# Yeah,	15
I need to start [ jog + something ] again.	9
Uh-huh <<faint>>.	15
{C And } one of the key things is how many adults are there in ratio to the children.	24
How easy <laughter>.	2
Yes.	4
[ I, + I ] guess that is supposed to be put out at a time when I was growing up or whatever.	24
yeah,	15
# <Laughter>  What are these things? #	25
That area, -	2
Ours is changing.	24
Yeah.	15
{C or } do you think it would be better for our leaders to just start seeking God on how to turn our nation around financially?	35
{C and, } [ it, +  we ]  were there like in the middle of the summer,	24
I know [ we'd, +  I'd ] like  to get into do more camping and  outings and things.	24
[ there's, + there's ] always a reason why they're on sale <laughter>.	9
-- {E I mean } just taking advantage of {D you know. } -	9
[ that, +  {F uh, } that ] was my graduation present to myself,	24
{D you know, } {D like } right now, today was in about, {D you know, } the fifties.	24
my kid is jumping on me.	24
I don't either.	24
Uh-huh.	15
that's true.	21
No,	33
I agree.	36
I don't.	24
Precious is a medium hair yellow cat,	24
you have to pay for it right away anyway.	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
{E I mean } it sounds like a train.	24
Texans talk to other people.	24
I think he gets beat up even though he's big, because he's -- -- pretty much overweight, and -- -- comes home with a few scratches now and then,	24
{F Uh, } you can't just listen to it,  {D you know, } [ to, + ] {F uh, } especially a lot of the deeper stuff,	9
{C and, } # what did she do with the, # -	39
-- {D you know, } I think I'm just part of [ tha-, + the ] new stuff, that is just, -	24
uh-huh.	15
I don't, {F um, } -	26
it's -- -	26
((   ))  {C because } I didn't need it.	24
Okay.	29
{C But } {E I mean, } even within the Muslim, {F uh, } religions, different sects, they can't get together.	24
{C and } I thought that, {F uh, } {D you know, } we'd have to have a big dog	24
[ I, + <noise> <<traffic outside>> I ] don't know that  w-, -	26
[ {C But, } +  {C but } ] I believe in paying taxes	9
{F Uh, } the mobility factor, the factor  that, {F uh, } {F oh, } we're living longer and  people are less trusting, all these things tend to  destroy this type of system.	9
{C and } no,	33
That's probably true.	21
Huh-uh.	33
I couldn't, {D you know } -- -- adjust that.	24
{C And } it was just so realistic.	24
{F Uh, } I think that the combination of, {F uh, }  technology and techniques like  that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution in the way we learn.	9
{D Like, } -	26
We're paying industry to make the products	9
{C and } the babies, -	24
{C and, }  {F uh, } [ he, + Brian ]  was two houses down. {D You know, }	24
No,	33
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } -	26
{C And } I expect you're right in regards to having two parents now.	36
{C and } they want to do  something else.	9
{C or } they didn't, -	24
Yeah.	36
{C And } [ that's, + {F uh, } that, ] I can honestly see the peer pressure there.	24
{D Well, } I agree with it wholeheartedly.	24
{C and, so } we were ready to look up the places we read about.	24
Yeah,	36
# Right.  #	15
{F Um, }	17
{F Uh, } I hope so <laughter>.	21
It seems to be catching on, {F uh, }  slowly but surely, I guess <laughter>.	9
[ We, + we ] can wear pretty much that, although, {F um, } tennis shoes are kind of out -- -- [ in, + in ] almost every, every situation -- -- unless you want to look like a gook <<phonetically spelled>>.	24
Are they oaks?	7
{C So } I've been pretty lucky there.	24
Uh-huh.	15
# Yeah. #	15
That's kind of Louisiana I think -- -- # if you do that.	24
have you seen it?	7
# <laughter>. #	20
Basically.	13
Yeah.	15
That's right.	36
then be gone.	15
we stayed mostly in state parks	24
{C and } [ in the, + in ] terms of the question, {F um, } in terms, {F uh, } -	24
{C But, } [ [ p-, + p-, ] + pumping ] more money into the school system is a -- -- good thing,	9
Yeah.	15
# {C and } # we had little kids at the time, {D you know, }	24
{C but } now  I think they're going to start getting into eye.	24
I'm saving two percent.	25
<laughter> Yeah	36
they don't have a goal,	9
# {F Uh. } #	26
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] the weather. -	24
Whereabouts?	39
I prefer a swimming pool <laughter>.	24
Is what they said what happened.	16
<Laughter> Yeah,	36
[ ye-, + ] it's nice.	9
{F uh, } what do you think you would offer as far as, {F uh, } information about selecting a school?	39
{F Um, } {C but } I also believe that the earth is a kind of a self-regulating system,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } he's still in Korea and his buddies home now <laughter>.	24
Rugby is definitely big in college	9
Yeah.	15
I know where that is.	24
You might remember the name Bruce Williams,	24
{F Oh, } that'd be awful.	21
{C but } they do come on  kind of late,	9
right,	15
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah,	38
{C and } I will probably be going back to work around January, whereas she will be about, eight or nine months old.	24
have you ever been to the Olive Garden?	7
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
I'm sorry.	41
Yeah.	15
[ We're, +  we're -- ] -- trying to -- -- find, -	24
I thought maybe that was the trick.	24
{F uh, } {D well, } do you have children?	7
{C and } [ [ th-, + they, ] + it ]  just really, -	24
{C And so } it jumped up on my bed and anointed my blanket, # for me.  [ Looking, +  looking ] # at me eye to eye, # all the time while it was doing it. #	24
I agree with him, too.	24
{F Oh, } that was funny, wasn't it <laughter>.	7
Right,	15
{C and } he had a way of putting you in that scene, {D you know. }	9
for me [ [ it's, +  it's a real, ] + it's a real ]  consideration, {F uh, } {F uh, }	24
{D Well, } I have a friend who's the same way,	24
[ {C But, } + {F uh, } {C so } ] I went to college  and  now since have completed two masters degrees	24
{F Oh, }  yeah.	21
{C But } it does work pretty well.	24
# What do you, # -	39
no,	33
{C So } I moved over [ a, +  a ]  few feet in the water and got out of his little realm where he was living underneath the dock and,  {F uh, } managed to get up.	24
No,	33
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
-- {C and } started [ dri-, + driving. ]	24
{C And then } [ we, + {D you know, } we ] investigated this by flying some people out from Dallas to observe some of the schools in California that already had it.	24
{D well, } I'll tell you,	13
# {D Well, } no sir. #	5
Uh-huh.	15
The, -	26
{C And } you can't find much  cover [ on, + <laughter> in ] a sand -- -- dune <laughter>.	24
{D Now } [ that, + ] [ do you, + do you ] agree, that they should all be unanimous?	7
I thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there.	9
what was -	39
{E I mean, } it was raining,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Um. }  Uh-huh,	15
I'm a nurse.	24
{F Um, } how long did you have that?	39
I know.	36
My husband opened it up and whatever,	24
Question. -	13
right.	15
I like doing things like making lasagna just because I can have it ready and baking -- -- in the oven,	24
Yeah.	15
I have my own saws	24
((We've)) got a five percent sales tax.	24
Okay,	29
Okay.	38
{D You know, } {D like } this Kennedy thing.	24
Yeah.	15
shelties are nice.	9
Uh-huh.	15
It was a mistake <laughter>.	24
{D So, } how do we fix the national budget?	39
if you ever get a chance to go over to Vicksburg,  the battleground at Vicksburg, {F uh, } there's an area [ there where +   there was, ] {F uh, } some Texas, {F uh, } groups	24
one of these days my grandkids probably. -	9
Women are not allowed to wear slacks,	24
{F Well } that's fact.	21
I don't know what a shoe company's doing running a computer company.	24
Take care.	38
and I, I know a lot of people, you know, have that	24
Uh-huh	15
{C and } it's, # really hard # [ because + ] [ to, + to ] really to get help. {F Uh, } [ d-, + ] {D you know } to get the work load shared.	9
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } that's not fair.   Because I can tell you one thing, stay home sometime and start doing some of those jobs that she's been handling	13
<Laughter>.  Do you have any tips you could give me?	7
{C and } it's like eight hundred pages <laughter>.	24
<Talking> Uh-huh.	15
I don't know,	34
That money is put into each month.	24
They are going to go on talk shows	9
{D You know } some of the health insurance is written that way. {D You know, } that, {F uh, } if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy, {D you know, } it  s-, + pre specified  in the policy so much	24
I am as a matter of fact.	24
{C but } it came up,	24
She'll be a hundred and three in August.	24
Where do you work?	39
Yeah,	15
[ I, + I, ]  {E I mean } I quiz them	24
[ {C and, } +  {C and, } ] -	26
{C and, } {F um, } -	26
more,  {D well, } [ it, + it's ] just like having taxes on, or exemptions for kids, {D you know. }	9
Right.	15
{D Well } at least we're going to have a space station supposedly in the next few years.	24
whether he can export or at least, {F uh, } set up trade and all then democracy of a considerable interest.	9
{C and } we know a lot of people at the church	24
That's true.	21
{C Because, } {D actually, } [ when you, + when you ]  do, {F uh, } service overseas you end up learning something, usually [ that's, + that's ]  really useful, plumbing, or  farming, [ or, + or ] something like that,	24
[ I, +   as a matter of fact I ] was talking to a friend yesterday, who said she has a new policy in her home	24
Yeah.	15
yeah,	36
Yeah,	36
{C and then, } in Europe, {D you know, } they speak their French and all	24
{C But, } {F uh, } yeah,	15
{C and } he did [ what, +  what ] he said	24
Even not for government, even just, {D say, } for a small business.	9
{C and so } they're [ more, +   less ] apt to vote in, {D you know, } more aid to people,	24
{C But, } with the three children -- -- {F um, } orthopedic care, {F um, }  not orthopedic, orthodontic care, -	24
Yeah.	15
that's true,	36
Is this going to be your first?	7
Sharon, Pennsylvania's up there.	24
I played the clarinet,	24
Just a second. <<Talking to child in background.>>	18
{F Oh } really.	15
{F Oh. }  {F Oh, } yeah.	36
<Swallowing> <lipsmack> {C And } that was here in Wisconsin.	24
I'm sure, with eight,	36
I guess -- -- it depends on what channel you're getting. {D You know, } what system you're getting it through.	24
{C And, }  {F uh, } seems like all big cities have plenty of that nowadays, doesn't it?	7
{C And, } {F uh, } [ the, + the ] MORNING NEWS [ [ [ was, + was, ] + i-, ] + is ] okay,	9
{C And } [ I, + {F uh, } of course, I ] don't ever get around to reading them <laughter>.	24
They're behavior problems.	9
no,	33
# Uh-huh. #	15
Right.	36
salary continuation.	24
{C And } he, -	26
Right.	15
{C And } [ it will, + it will ] make [ the, + the ] strain worthwhile.	9
sure,	15
yeah,	4
[ th-, + they've  ] never had a job.	9
I guess in my spare time I'll be making T shirts <inhaling>.	24
Catholic schools  are generally considered a little bit easier than the public schools,	9
All righty.	26
we have a, -	24
{D Well, } Texas has gotten to where it's a real problem as far as plants, because our summers are so terribly hot --	24
The guy that used to  live next to us in Richardson before we moved twelve years ago, or whatever, he had a sailboat, used to park it right in the, {F uh, }  driveway	24
{F Um, } let's see,	17
I don't know.	19
[ [ [ [ What, +  what, ] + what, ] +  what's   on, + what's ] this mat, {E I mean, }	39
I think the kids now [ are, + are, ] I would say, louder now until after they reach like twenty-five,	9
Uh-huh,	15
I don't see how anything can survive out there, <Laughter> for long periods of time.	24
I mean, those people, they'll call you any time of the day or night with, try to solicit --	9
I thought it was so that you give them an education of that particular discipline.	24
{F Uh, } [ we, + we ] always enjoyed it.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } I, -	26
<laughter> I don't need to see more of it.	24
You go set up.	24
{C but } it wasn't that bad,	24
{F Oh } yeah,	36
{C But, } {F uh, } they say that there, it's almost down  to zero where people come back and say they are positive and they're not.	24
# Bye-bye. #	38
Okay.	29
Yeah.	15
Well, he had a classic case of hoof in mouth disease.	9
Right.	15
{C And } that's normal,	27
Uh-huh.	15
Oh.	15
{D You know, } one of the best television news shows that I saw during the war was a show on a Saturday morning on A B C,	24
{C and } one is in seventh grade,	24
{C And } they usually are real basic, # common sense things. #	9
{C so } it's really amazing  how much a minivan [ c-,  {D you know, } what it + ] can  do.	9
Uh-huh.	15
I've maybe been into the office once in the past  (( three ))  years, {D you know. }	24
{C and } it was really helpful at the time.	24
Yeah <laughter>.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C Because } it's too many, -	24
Uh-huh.	15
I've heard the construction is pretty good on Fox and Jacobs.	24
{C And } there, -	26
(( There's ))  lots and lots of volunteer programs	9
Does he.	15
Okay.	29
<inhaling> {C And } for her to miss a soap, it was a big withdrawal.	24
It's only been, not even a year yet,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Um,  } I don't know though	19
when they replace it, {D you know, } they're going to really come up with something that is not just as bad.	24
and they still want kind of a sports car.	24
Texas is a big state,	24
{C but } -	26
Do you work # during the day? #	7
Some of our neighbors were doing it	24
I don't know how you can really keep, {F uh, }  the inside of a tent clean.	9
Right,	15
{C And } they made sure they pointed it out, {D you know. }	24
{C and, }  {F um, } I had said, -	24
yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
It was there.	24
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } {D actually } I wasn't including a printer,	3
Okay,	26
[ we're, + I ] happen to teach at a college with a tremendous number of international students	24
{F Um, } {D you know, } [ I, +  I ]  just wanted to see if, {D you know, } you had an opinion about this,	24
she always, -	26
That was pretty good though <laughter>.	9
{D Well, } around here, we have some, {D you know, }  the churches, take [ your, + the ]  children	24
# {C and } it's # -- -- a never ending problem.	24
{C and, }  {F uh, } I thought boy that sure looks like that pup we gave away --	24
I enjoyed it.	24
{F Uh, } I haven't really talked to anybody that's, {D you know, } too involved with that.	24
{C and, } -	26
are they new <laughter>.	7
Sure.	36
{C And, } {F uh, } we had a review today	24
[  I, + I ] think so, too.	9
{C but } somehow people, -	26
We may have to deal with, -	9
{F Oh, } that's good, that's real good advice.	9
{C and } they needed some quality care,	24
Yeah,	15
{D Well, } that's still not enough for a total, is it.	7
It would be a neat case where {D like, } where kids  taught the parents, I think, {D you know. }	9
Yeah,	15
yeah.	4
[ There, + there's ]  some other cars I'd like	24
Uh-huh.	15
Then I could be getting paid for something I love to do.	24
that's probably true.	40
it is I don't know, {F um, }	19
# {C But } you, {D you know, } -	26
# Yeah.  #	15
{C but } I took a date to it, {F uh, } about a month ago.	24
{F Um. }	26
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] sort of got off the, {F uh, } bulletin board and off of my micro completely --	24
{C and then, } {F uh, } I don't know what we usually have for dessert.	24
Uh-huh,	15
We drove down to Port Aransas, # and # rented a little efficiency, {D you know, } # [ and, # + and ] had a marvelous like two nights,	24
{C and } he had skipped bail	24
Oh,	17
{F Uh, } THIS PRESENT DARKNESS and, {F uh, } {F uh, } I forget the [ t-, + the ] other,	24
-- {E I mean, } {D you know, } that was just  so phenomenal to see this stadium shake -- -- [ and the, + and the ] announcers, {D you know } grabbing,	24
Right.	36
{C But } [ they, + they ] said they can't be  smashed or else, {F uh, }	24
it's just, -	9
uh-huh.	15
{C and } he didn't like  this run because there were no people that came by	24
Night,	13
One, you need to make it illegal for both parents to work while the kids are under seven.	9
{C And, }  {F uh, } they will rent a pavilion on a weekend,	24
{F uh, } we had no regulation against it	24
-- {C and, }  {F uh, } he's pretty gassed about it.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Certainly do.	11
Uh-huh.	15
I can't  (( stand that ))	24
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and, } {D you know, } people, [ man-, + ] more than manufacturers should get a clue	9
{F Oh, } sure.	21
uh-huh.	15
I didn't, -	26
{C but, } {D you know, } sometime when I ask, I just feel like, boy, am I stupid or what.	24
{C And, }  by the way, my name's Bill.	24
{C because } I live just south of the Interstate.	24
{F Uh, }	15
{F Oh, } no.	21
Uh-huh.	15
{E I mean, } {F uh, } you should have no objection to it,	9
They don't exist anymore,	24
{C And } what's it going to be like in another twelve years when my, {F uh, } oldest son is in high school.	16
I don't, -	26
{F Uh, }  it's kind of unusual here we are in Dallas, {D you know, } the biggest location [ and, + and ]  it just breezed through	24
<Throat_clearing>.	20
{F uh, } do you work outside the home?	7
{C but }  the coverage wasn't near as good  (( as ))  when we, {D you know, } switched over to channel eight	9
I see.	15
tell, # -	26
{D So, } [ that, + that's ] really strange.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
-- you're encouraged to do it because, {F um, }  {D you know, } [ it, + it ] helps you,	24
# I sure # did.	24
{C but, } it does seem -	9
I don't know.	19
Right,	15
[ The, + {F uh, } the ]  one that, {F uh, } {F uh, } -	26
yeah.	15
{D Well, } [ I can, + I can ] work [ up, +  {F um, } here up ] to a year.	24
What do you think about that?	31
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
it's on the campus of the T I facility,	24
{D Well, } I killed it pretty quick.	24
Okay <beep>.	29
Okay.	38
{F Oh, } just part of it <laughter>.	11
{C  so } when I first moved here I probably did consider that  an invasion of privacy	24
they literally cannot come in out of the rain.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } {F uh, } interestingly enough, right before I moved up here, -	24
my parents did a lot of that.	24
{F Uh, } she ends up with so many plants that she can't fit them all in her garden.	24
Yeah,	15
I've been there before	24
Yeah,	4
{C Or } it just builds up so often,	22
[ [ {C And } it, + {C and } # it, ] + {C and } [ it has, + it has, ] ] {D you know, } -	24
All right,	15
{C And, }  {F uh, } [ it, + it ]  was, {F uh, } good to remember [ [ the, + {F uh, } that, ] +   that ] kind of Asian philosophy -- -- # that, {F uh. } # -	24
Exactly.	36
{C and } I don't know why you couldn't after sixty-five every five years have a refresher course and then take another driving.	9
{C but, } {F uh, } [ social [ [ eth-, + eth-, ] + and ethics, ] + socially and  ethically ] I think it's a good idea, # in certain crimes. #	9
{C and, } {D you know, } I would have them [ drop, + # {D right, } drop ] their cans off # in my office	24
{C But, } {F um, } if I were to cook, {F uh, } a dinner party, {F uh, } it may be standard to you	24
How about you,	31
{C but } -- --  {F uh, } never did get out and ski <laughter>.	24
Yeah.	15
I think the last novel  [ I read +  I read, ] I guess, in conjunction with my wife over vacation last year.	24
{C So } we've tried to get out once a year and go on a anniversary camp out,	24
{F Uh, } this one, yeah,	11
Uh-huh.	15
[ it's, +  it's ] amazing how  much we spend on some things.	9
Uh-huh.	15
-- {C and } now when I come out here I just kind of let it go,	24
{F Oh, } {D now, } [ I lo-, + I like  ] the turtles.	24
They just changed it because X had a connotation with it,  {D you know, }	9
Wow.	21
# {C And, } # -	26
{C and } he's two now,	24
It's, {F uh, } kind of unusual book.	24
we have a set amount	24
Right.	15
There are very few Scouts go on, and become Eagle Scouts.	9
[ it's, + it's.  ] -	26
One of the ones that I've read recently that I've read several of his books	24
{C But, } {F uh, } it wasn't necessarily, -	26
uh-huh,	36
Yeah.	15
Exactly.	36
Uh-huh.	15
I think that's a bit dramatic,	9
at the time it was still, {F oh, } about forty or fifty cents a pound,	24
Oh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
[ I, + I ] agree.	36
{C And, } {F uh, } -	26
The roof was really sorry.	24
[ [ [ I, + they didn't, ] + they didn't, ] + they were ] again-, -	26
{C and }  it was, {F uh, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } yeah,	36
the weather -- -- {D you know, } does change fast	9
Uh, just usually pretty local in, in nature	9
Yeah,	15
[ It's   hurting, +   {D you know, } it's hurting ] Germany, for example, too,  and some other parts of Europe [ where they, + where they  ] have high industry.	9
{F Oh, } boy.	15
{D You know, } why isn't somebody stepping in [ and, +  and ] [ sto-, +  putting a stop ] to this.	25
I guess we've discussed everything there is about clothing <laughter>.	9
[ that's, + that's ] a high irritant for me.	24
Uh-huh.	15
-- {C and so } during the dry season you have to water the foundation to keep your foundation [ from, + {F uh, } from, ] {F uh, } drooping --	24
Oh.	15
Yeah.	15
Okay.	15
[  I would, + I would ] think so.	36
I guess it's the texture, or something.	24
no,	26
# {C and } # it keeps me from being the old  (( fogy ))	24
Uh-huh.	15
they get -- -	9
The prices, {D actually, } a lot better, because Pittsburgh is about the size, {A I've been trying to think, } like a Louisville, or  Minneapolis, that type of size.	24
She puts a lot of financial.	24
Well, El Paso won't be cold.	32
Okay,	36
I think that's regressive	9
See you later.	38
today was pretty,	24
<Noise>.	20
{D Well } thank you for calling.	38
I know the systems have been  real strong out.	24
{C But } I also heard, for instance, {D like, } {F uh, } my friend's daughter was on it through Texas Instruments,	24
<ugh> [ they, + they  ] need to stay outside, far away from me.	9
we have that too. #	24
I'm -	26
{D Well, } it was nice talking to you,	38
you've got some people could be arrested for, {F uh, } drug use,  drug dealings and things like that,	9
Right,	15
they, really are.	9
{E I mean } if you ever walked into  E D S -s health, corner court health clubs on site -- -- and you walk into Spring Creek,  {D well, } Spring Creek's better than the one on Dallas Parkway #	9
{F Oh, } yeah,	15
--  [ but the qua-, +  but actually  have a truer standard ] of living.	9
I guess I've had some good experience and some bad experience with them.	24
if you've ever been to {D like } New York City	26
{E I mean, } {F oh, }  if something happens to her.	24
they pop up pretty fast.	24
{C and } that's the only reason, {D you know, }  I go to him -- -- because I know him	24
-- {C so } I have three children, {F um, } [ fifteen, + ages fifteen, ] seventeen and  twenty --	24
{C and } he ran into the motorcycle.	24
{C and } I know that they're going to use, {D you know, } the money for that to build some kind of multipurpose field and  that type of thing. (( Put lights ))  and stuff	24
If you did not want to do it. -	25
Not right now,	5
{C And } that's, {D you know, } -	26
They did,	36
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah.	15
{D well } thanks.	38
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
A jar or something	8
it's like transporting stuff and things like  that, # before, {D you # know, } it's {D like } -	24
She's done a lot of things that I never thought she would do, {D you know, } [ with, + <laughter> with ] the family because she was [ m-, + ] the one that said she was never getting married and never going to have any children.	24
{C but } I was with my wife	24
{F Uh, } yeah,	4
that sounds good.	21
Colorado Springs.	13
{C and } I'm going to have to stop and explain,	24
Yeah,	15
# {C and } # also, [ it w-, + it ] produces [  [ a, + a  waste, ] + [ a, + {F um, } a, ] liquid waste ] that they don't know what to do with <noise>  yet.	24
Yeah.	15
{C And, } {F uh. } -	26
{D Well, } [ I don't, + I don't ] know if you got to see WEEKEND, {F um, } AT BERNIE'S -- -- # that # was out a couple of year's ago.	8
they learn a lot,	24
[ We, + we're ] over in the western edge in the mountains.	24
Uh-huh.	15
it's both of us then were really just adolescents [ when, +  when, ] -	24
{C And, then } it has little rooms off of it where, {D you know, } you'd go and sleep at night time.	24
That'd be neat.	24
{C and, } [ the-, + there's ] quite a few boys	24
{C So, } yeah,	36
{C so } <child_yelling>, our time is scarce.	24
{F Um. }	26
{F Oh, } that sounds good --	21
{C And, } {F uh, } north African cooking is good -- -- when you use something called couscous.	24
{C And so } I don't know how it can change to where the mother can get back into the home again.	24
{C but, } -	26
Right.	15
and they raise champion cats.	24
Yeah.	15
(( {F Oh } )) , I like all kinds of books.	24
[ I, + I ] don't know [ what amount of, + what amount of, ] our hardware would stop some fanatic, I guess, from doing anything, {F uh, } that would be irrational.	24
{C and } they, -	26
Uh-huh.	4
[ And as, + and did some, ] {D you know, } instructions at the country club for a while.	24
it would have been, I think, much more fun to do it {D like } in the van, with a bunch of people.	9
[ I'm, + I, ] -	26
I know.	36
Uh-huh.	15
[ The, + the ]  learning of it and the, -	9
I can't really complain.	9
{C and } your money comes out, {D you know, } every once in a while, for however much poundage you've got.	24
{C But. } -	26
{C But, }  {F uh, } he didn't carry any  ties or anything  because [ he, + he ] just went over there with [ the + that ] attitude, {D well }  if I don't take it then they won't make me wear it <laughter>.	24
I'm going to do it again.	24
Bye-bye <Noise>	38
[ th-, + that ] [ lea-, + led ] to that.	9
Yeah,	15
((   ))  return anything. -	13
{C And } I had frozen it	24
So would I <laughter>.	24
Yeah,	15
Yeah.	36
{C but, }  {F uh, }  the watching, -	26
# Yeah. #	15
{D Well, } [ we've, + {F uh, } we've ] been fortunate enough to take a couple of trips over to Europe	24
{C And } I was thinking, {D well, } {D you know, } I know why your God damn bill is so high,	24
I know a guy that upgrades, {F uh, } for a reasonable cost.	24
Yeah,	15
<Laughter>.	20
Grass,	30
{C and } I couldn't get over, -	24
I live in an apartment <laughter>.	24
Yeah.	15
{C But } {D anyway. } -	26
{C so. } -	26
Surely do.	36
currently, I think they are a little restrictive.    {F Uh, } particularly for, {F uh, } certain ethnic groups or from certain countries.	9
They're the best kind.	9
{D well } actually I lived  there,	24
-- [ {C so, } +  {C but } ]  everyone [ seems, + {F uh, } has seem   to ] relocated down that area.	24
{C and } it is probably going to be six to eight years before they go to college.	24
Right.	15
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
-- [ {C and, } +  {C and, } ] a big percentage of that was expended, as well,	24
{D well } then she could go if she  were interested.	24
That's what I think, because I see what my  grandmother puts me through,	24
Sure.	36
<Laughter>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
[ [ the, +  they   s-, ] +  {F uh, } it's sold ] in the hobby stores and nurseries.	24
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{F oh, } I've been through five of those <laughter>.	24
{C or } would that be more fair or less fair.	16
It's just nice and green right now <laughter>.	24
{C and } I get a lot of pressure from [ people that, + {D you know, }  my colleagues  ]	24
Huh-uh.	15
{C but, }  {F uh, } to me their not that big enough   for a pool,	9
{C and } our kids loved it and everything	24
I'm in Dallas.	24
<Laughter>  Okay.	15
{D Well, } not very well.	24
{C But, }  {F uh, } they make it as hard as possible,	9
uh-huh.	15
I would think so,	21
{C and, } {F uh, } of course, we kind of concentrate on  ((   )) ,	9
yeah,  {D you know, }	26
They didn't care about what went on.	24
Yeah,	15
[ I, + I, ] -	26
{F Uh, } yeah,	15
{C or } are you, -	35
{E I mean, } {D you know, } in retrospect, {F um, } [ was it, + was it  ] Mondale or  Dukakis that said, {D you know, } [ I'll, + I'll  ] tell you right now I'm going to raise taxes?	7
Yeah.	15
I see.	29
{C But } # [ we, + we ] see, # -	26
I just started doing this	24
let's see, at this point on, I don't run out of money.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } I like suspense.	24
It's high dollar.	9
<Laughter>.	20
<Child_talking>.	20
(( Since they'll ))  be going back at the end of the month.	24
{D Well, } sounds like you're from up north.	9
Uh-huh.	15
there were apparently voters who just threw up their hands after the last voters pamphlet because they were [ asked, + being asked  ] to make decisions on topics that would have three different competing proposals	24
{D Well, } the insurance companies and all that [ tried to, + tried to ] go after him	24
Yeah.	15
{E I mean, } there, if you don't live in a house that's at least seventy-five to hundred years old, {D you know, } you're just nobody, practically <laughter>.	24
I know.	24
I find the one I use mostly, {F uh, } -	24
I like those.	24
{C So } he's out for good.	21
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] they get, {D you know, } -	26
{C And, } she's got two day cares within {D like } three blocks of each other.	24
Yeah,	36
{C and, } {F uh, } it was all from taking the right vitamins and things [ that, + that ] give you the strength,	9
{C so. } -	26
I don't get into the -- -	24
{C but, }  I'm not sure.	24
{C and } I said, adios,  [ I'm, + {D you know, } I'm  ] not paying you,	24
{C And } that's the type of something that whatever you mix with it this couscous, {F uh, } absorbs the taste of whatever else you put in it where that makes a very delicious dish.	24
you kind of try # and buy bigger quantities.	22
# Yeah. #	15
When do they assume this is going to be proposed or mandatory?	39
[ I have, + I can ] [ gi-, + get ] it within {D like, } {D you know, } four or five feet or something	24
All right.	38
of course, Texas Rangers being  one of them,	24
Right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
I see.	38
{C but } then, {D you know, } like I said, I came in backwards.	24
Yes,	36
{C and } we don't see it,	24
{C and } I couldn't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just everybody [ was, + <breathing> was ] waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but, } {F uh, } -	26
maybe there ought to be some kind [ of, + of, ] {F uh, }  ((   )) -	9
Uh-huh.	15
Mostly, I think in a place where  it's really cold they do it in the fall,	24
the experience that I've had is that, {F um, } <breathing> whatever time he [ gave, +  said, ] {F Oh, } it would take me [ about, + just about ] four hours, because it was only about like eleven or twelve hundred square feet over there, <breathing>	24
[ It's, + it's ] kind of hard to <<pause>> <lipsmack> -	9
Yeah.	15
{C and } I think they put it like eleven o'clock, {F um, } California time, {D like } in California	24
we try to [ limit, + look ] at that also,	24
{C Because } they just finished cleaning up from the last flood.	24
No.	33
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } that is really super kind of stuff, too. [ Take, + ] if you like Continental at all -- -- that kind of stuff --	24
Ouch.	21
# Uh-huh. #	15
{E I mean } do you  stay not in one place too long?	7
{C but } that's how long it is.	24
{C and, } {D you know, } they had this park where they were letting anybody use drugs as long as they stayed in the park	24
{F Oh, } that's good,	21
Yeah. #	26
It was kind of getting to me, [ where, + where ] I'm doing the same thing <laughter>.	24
{C And then, } {F um, } for most people I know it would be day care	24
directly after the trial they found out he really was guilty	24
I'll go do that <laughter>.	24
Usually catch it going to work on the radio.  Or when I drag the paper in from the  front and [ it + ]  ((   ))  catch the head lines, which is normal what you see the night  before on the evening news.	24
That's good for the clothes budget, I #would imagine.#	8
Oh.	15
{C but } I guess overall, because I guess I'm not associated with what ghetto schools, [ [ and, + and, ] + {F uh, } and, ] {F uh, } rural school systems are like,  [ I, + I ] should imagine that would take an enormous expenditure.	9
yet. # -	26
{C so } you're still young.	9
-- {C and, } {F uh, } one of the things that probably would have been better [ if, + ] is if the entire county [ had had, + had ] just one school system.	9
Yeah,	4
{C And, } we would watch the first fifteen minutes	13
{C and then, } of course, one thing  I think, too, is with tele-, -	9
{D Well, } <breathing> [ I ju-, + I just ] feel like there's a lot of murderers and  rapists, and everything else, just walking the streets.  {D You know? }	9
get out of my cabinets.	22
I think that is a stigma  [ and an  I, + and an ] impression that has come  from some few bad experiences.	9
{F Uh, } Mercury Topaz.	24
yeah.	15
{D Well, } the topic's about government.	24
you're, # -	26
{C And, }  just [ kind of, +  kind of ] go out and,  {F uh, } rent all the movies and, {F uh, } {F uh, } {D you know, } just kind of go, -	24
Uh-huh.	15
-- {C and, } {F uh, } they keep hitting [ it, + the tree  ] with the lawn mower.	24
No.	32
{C And } when you walked into their room, they had brought all their furniture from their house  --	24
You're down there on,  {D you know, } twentieth and eighteenth and -- -- # F G. #	22
{C and then } I transferred to a very large school.	24
{C but } I don't know if you can afford the insurance,	8
I'd say [ it's, + it's  ] probably in the [ top, + top  ] ten in terms of crime.	11
{C and }  I just don't think there is [ a day, + a good daycare ] system.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Ooh.	21
{C And } that's why I said that's it,	24
[ Saw it was, + saw where it  was ] coming from.	24
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh,	15
{D So } it's -	26
{C and } they were talking about, {F uh, } mass murderers --	24
{C So } do you have a family too?	7
<Laughter> {D Well, } [ you don't, + {F uh, } you don't ] like the Skins?	8
{C and } my kids wanted to learn how to play it	24
Uh-huh.	15
By this time of the year they'd had enough rainfall for the whole year,	24
# It does, #	36
# Uh-huh. #	15
I was, {F uh, } watching T V yesterday	24
Oh <<very faintly>>.	15
{C and so } -- -- we're usually outside,	24
Uh-huh,	15
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } this is in Plano.	24
That's awful.	21
I agree.	36
{C and } that had to dry.	24
there was more gore than I was interested in seeing.	24
Definitely <talking>.	36
# I don't get too many. #	24
{C and } they daily have problems [ with, + with ] whoever is taking care of the child,	24
You don't have to stretch.	2
# Uh-huh. #	15
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C But, }  {F uh, } I don't know,	19
{F Oh, } that's right.	36
it was more of a relief -- -- for her.	9
Uh-huh.	15
The only one that [ we, + we ]  have that we kept was the Discover card,	24
{C But, } I stay from that crap.	24
That's good.	21
{D Well, } how long did it take you all?	39
[ Our, + our ] kids are grown up.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I keep hearing that, {D you know, } the government [ and, + and ] the crime rates pretty high too,	24
Okay,	29
{D Well, } yeah,	4
{F Uh, } I don't think, -	26
No.	33
{C but } the whole group  goes out hunting	24
isn't that weird?	7
{C but } I guess [ every [ [ [ one, + one ] + <laughter> one, ] + one ] of them, + {E or } every once in a while, ] you get one that's not so <laughter> intelligent -- -- because this one, it. -	9
if I have, -	26
{C And } [ he, + he ] writes the same thing, though.	24
{F uh, } my, {F uh, } fiancee's family's from Wisconsin --	24
{D Well, } I think that's all I have.	24
{C and then } I did most of my camping in the mountains.	24
Never saw the bass?	8
Didn't mean to cut you off there.	41
{C and } the people that go to my Church,  {D you know } -	24
{C And } I looked at the credit card agreement one day,	24
Uh-huh.	15
The only problem is that now, {F uh, } originally when we had them, {F uh, } they were mainly <sigh> my mother's <sigh>,	24
[ [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] +  {F uh, } {C and } ]  [ [ it's, +  it's, ] +  it's ] certainly accepted [ more places than, +  the places, ]   {D you know, } -	24
She had no help?	7
very true.	21
it depends on the subject {D actually. }	24
-- the most important years of my life {D you know } <laughter>.	24
not being able to put it off for fifteen years. -	9
[ That's, + that's  ] pretty low that there's -- -- forty-eight countries ahead of us that have [ more peop-, +  more citizens  ] percentage wise   that can read and write,	9
Yeah,	15
{C and } I don't have a lot of background knowledge in, {F uh, } military strategy [ and, + and ] weaponry, [ and, + and ] all that kind of stuff.	24
Didn't they just have an article, {F oh, } on, {F uh, } -	7
Not really.	9
{F Uh, } the first of Amy Grant # before # -- -	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } [ they have, + they have ] K C R W, which [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] saw a thing recently, they may be trying to start their own, {F uh, } cable TV outlet, <clanking> I guess.	24
{F Uh, } [ does, + does ] the WALL STREET JOURNAL, {F uh, } -	7
now we get channel fifty-five, although we do not have cable, we do get channel fifty-five.	24
That was pretty good	9
{D You know, } they <noise> <<dishes rattling>> go	24
{C so } -- -- they ask all kinds of wild questions.	9
{D see } yeah.	26
# {C but } # I don't think that [ they're going, + they're going ] to change that,	9
{C and } it lasts along time.  *[[along -> a long]]	24
I think [ it's + now,  [ is what, + {F uh, } from what ] I understand it's  ] air conditioning units	9
{C And } I'm sure you enjoyed every minute of it.	9
{C or } let me see,	17
-- {C and then } there was a big  climactic fight scene,	24
In fact, at one time I worked as a second shift,	24
Where they may have just had a teaching major and then had some social studies courses	9
{F Uh, } [ we, + we ] really didn't go that route and didn't look.	24
<Laughter>.	20
Really?	12
{D You know, } I remember when I was  working in high school, {D you know, } I was working in an office,  right after I got out of high school	24
{D You know } I would [ rather +  much rather ] get on a  plane and get there -- -- and then enjoy myself.	24
we have one of those, # too. #	24
Bye-bye.	38
[ It's, + it's ]  amazing the way, -	9
Yeah,	15
we've had it, -	24
{C But } then I didn't need all that  anymore, so I finally sold that,	24
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
I tape it.	24
Yeah,	4
yes.	26
# Bye-bye. #	38
# {E I mean } # back then -	26
Part of it is technology, yeah.	22
{D Well, } [ I enj-, + I enjoy ] fiddling around.	24
{F Huh. }	26
we didn't necessarily have a lot of things <laughter>,	24
Right.	15
{C But, } {F uh, } I do not know,	19
{C but, }   {F um, } -	26
uh-huh.	4
[ Anything, + anything ] can go.	24
{C and } I went, {F oh, }   I can do that	24
-- {C and } also the, {F uh, } <lipsmack> -	26
{C and } it, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
that's good,	21
In the winter time there was [ no  smell at all, +  no odor at all ] to it.	24
Right.	15
It may be a much reduced force than what we used to have over there.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } sure.	21
#  ((   )) . #	20
right.	36
{F Huh. }   That seems like you've thought this through quite a bit before.	9
{C But, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } you learn something every time you use it.	24
Yeah,	15
{D Well, } when we first moved here, we moved here from Lubbock --	24
{C and } [ a lot of them were, + I think there was a couple that were ] schizophrenic	24
[ [ I'm, + I'm, ] + I'm ] a photographer now.	24
I'd say I camp quite a bit.	9
I agree, because it's not fair to those of us [ that, + that ] deserve a safe, {D you know, } life to have to, -	9
I teach at a public school, actually,	24
{C and } good talking with you.	38
Yeah,	15
INVISIBLE MAN by Ralph Ellison.	8
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } I read, {F uh, } -	24
{C and } I've only been there for lunch,	24
{C and, } {F uh, } I wish I had more time to do it.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } seems like we're always working on it, as I'm sure, it is with your house.	24
{F Uh, } my daughter lives in Arlington,	24
I was going to say.	24
# To be violent. #	9
{F Uh, }	15
I agree.	24
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } I know, we're saving our grocery bags now.	24
No.	36
I'm sure within those people's minds, it's quite justified.	24
{F Uh, }	26
{C and } we ski and swim in the summer	24
{C and } [ it's, + it's ] really [ not, + {D you know, } not ] that far.	24
Did she know that she was going to a nursing home?	7
{F Oh, } it's {D you know, } really weird stuff,   he likes,	24
I think, {D well, } [ it's, +   it's ] definitely a problem,	9
I think the Cowboys probably have [ a, + a ] better team.	9
exactly. #	36
I'm not saying that they were, a couple of years ago.	24
Huh.	15
Mostly for word processing type things?	7
{C so, } {F uh, } he's been retired for three years now.	24
That sounds great.	21
To get over a, -	26
If it's not making money, then we'll do away with it.	24
Okay.	29
Uh-huh.	15
That's the best way to shop.	9
{C and } I have a real problem with anything like pesticides or anything like that,	24
{C and } when he was younger I think he started them,	24
-- the house explodes?	7
{C and } I try to be an optimist  and say, well [ that, + that's ] one way is to help any problem whether it be crime, or certainly poverty obviously [ is to, + is to ] get some business going between each other.	9
# {F Oh } my goodness,	21
I just have found everything I've read of his to be fabulous, # {F um, }	9
[ I, + I ] tell you sometimes I worry  about things over seas because we have such problems right here in our own country.	24
{C and } my folks gave it to me,	24
Thanks,	38
It sounds like you'd have lots of shading -- -- on that particular piece.	22
I really think it ought to be s-, -	9
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
yeah.	15
[ I, + I ] don't either.	24
We never really, <pounding>  {D you know, } have to program money for that or make choices, {D you know. }	24
it's in the forties.	24
What type of job do you have?	39
Uh-huh.	15
{C so, } if you want them to stay in prison  for fifteen years, don't sentence them to fifteen years, sentence them to a hundred.	9
Which is, -	26
Yeah --	15
Uh-huh.	15
I usually start in the fall.	24
I'm not a people person.	24
Yeah.	4
Absolutely.	36
Yeah,	15
even though I live further out in the suburbs, the crime follows you anywhere,	9
I didn't want to go camping with diapers, {D you know. }	24
{C But, } {F uh, } as far as income tax is  concerned, I can't complain too much about it.	9
{F Uh, } I can begin this, {F um, }	24
# {C But, } # -	26
seems to be to easy to get busy with other things.	24
Definitely.	36
It's amazing that people actually, -	9
Kids learn at different rates	9
{D So } [ [ that, + is that, ] + is that ] kind of your  child right now?	8
I can't take all these shows on because next semester I'm not going to be able to watch hardly any television.	24
[ It's, +  it's ] really [ hard, +  hard ]  to find time to spend together when you both work full time and, {F uh, } you both have hobbies that are different.	9
{C So, }  I netted it,	24
You mean they don't have [ the, + {F uh, } the ] smog alerts?	7
As you start putting lots of little kids together, the infection rates that go around <hum>. -	24
I've been to, been to Salvador	24
{C so } why make fun of mine?	25
Uh-huh.	38
Yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
It's far beyond me.	9
rent a beach house or something,  *[[slash error]] {D yeah, }  [ that's, + that's ] my idea of camping.   *[[looks like the 'yeah' should be an independent slash unit ]]	22
exactly.  #	36
{C because }  [ s-, + San ] Antonio isn't that close to you, are they?	7
{C but, } -	26
There's more people in jail right now for child support,  okay -- -- then there are for people doing drugs.	9
Uh-huh.	15
((   )) . -	20
{C and } I seen [ a, + a ] magazine for, {D you know, } -	24
Uh-huh.	15
Okay.	29
Uh-huh.	15
# {D Well, } [ not, + # not ] all of us.	32
{F Oh. }	15
<Laughter>.	20
{C and } I'd have to go load it up the next day.	24
{C and } they said it was okay.	24
{C and } when you opened up the bank deregulation without any controls, I thought, {D well, } that was the philosophy, {D you know. }	9
I think some, -	26
When I married, I thought I'd be married the rest of my life.	24
A lot of stuff, -	9
Yeah.	15
{C and }  after three years of working at it, [ I've, + I've ] been amazed at just  what a little bit of doing <<pause>> help out things to the lawn has really brought it back.	24
Yeah.	15
Right.	15
I, {F uh, } -	26
Okay,	13
yeah,	36
<Laughter>.	20
{D Well, } if I were look-, -	26
that's true.	21
{C but } I # -- -- do have children to think about, # {D you know. } #	24
It's like any other symphony.	24
{F Oh, } my <laughter>.	21
Good.	21
{C and } <<voices fade off>> ... -	26
{F Uh, } [ our, + our  ] <noise> van, which is [ a, + a  ] delight to drive, does not have, -	24
{C But } I think, -	26
# Uh-huh.	15
[ [ I, + {F um, } I had a, ] + for many years I had a ] dog that was part Springer Spaniel.	24
That's something that, {F uh, } people have seen.	24
Yeah.	15
{C And, } they seem to do fine.	24
{C but } I do {D like, } {F uh, } {D like }  [ a seafood bar, +  {D like } a [ raw, +  raw ]  bar ] {D like } oysters and  things like that, {F uh } --	24
She is.	36
Yeah,	15
# Uh-huh.  #	15
so, you know, -	26
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
We have the same thing.	24
Yeah,	15
#  ((   )) . #	13
They make a decision based on [ consti-, + constituency ] -- -- instead of a decision based on what they really believe.	9
{F Oh, } great.	21
Yeah.	15
uh-huh.	15
<Laughter>  {F Uh, } [ I've, + I've ]  got one at home too.	24
Uh-huh.	15
it's great,	21
Whether -	26
there's something going on there, and that I would have discernment by the holy spirit to deal with pride over that.	24
# Yeah. #	36
{C But } that's only fair.	9
{C and then }  somebody got injured	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } he's a [ computer programmer, +  {E or }  computer engineer. ]	24
{F Um. }	15
then he buys the pieces that have that person. {D You know, } on it.	24
Yeah,	36
{C so } that's nice,	21
{F Oh, } and there's a phone in  here that's hilarious.	24
[ {C And } something else that I would, + {C And } something else that I would ] like to see  [ is, + is, ] {F uh, } victim reimbursement, {D you know, } because they, {D you know, } like  you say these guys are in jail	24
they, uh, the ones that have, uh, families, uh,	24
Right.	15
I think [ football is, + football is ] kind of [ a, + a ] sport that I think you kind of, it's hard not to like it.	9
Somehow it just doesn't,	9
{C And then, } {F um, } as my kids got older and started, {D you know, } recognizing what was going on, I thought, this isn't really very good <laughter>.	24
{C so, } -	26
Which really was not the attitude with Vietnam.	9
{C so } you have the sash windows in?	8
-- {C and, }  {F um, } aside from the, {F uh, } -	26
{C and so } [ [ we, + we were thinking we wanted to do, ] + {D you know, } we were going to try doing ] it ourselves,	24
{C and } it's a great place.	24
uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	36
Sort of.	11
Uh-huh.	15
I lived in France for a year and a half	24
yeah. #	15
-- {C and } she sends her taxes to me	24
Right,	15
{C and, }  {F um, } I'll turn it on every once in awhile	24
-- {C and, } {D you know, } good doctors in Boston.	24
Yeah.	15
they, {F um, } {F um, } -	26
at our house, as soon as you touch a vine, it's like it completely dies.	24
{C and } if it was done  quickly and done swiftly -	9
taken some electronics classes, and  one class [ in, + ] {F um, } with computer logic.	24
{C and } I happened to be  with her and managed to get her to the other side of the road because  it was dark and all,	24
# {D Well, } today # it's not bad out there.	9
He either hits home run  or strike out.	24
I got my Mustang this time [ was + ]  by myself, because I got on my own, or whatever,	24
What do you do Georgeanne?	39
{F Uh, } have you seen any of the behind the scenes, {F uh, } [ of, + of ] that movie.	8
{C So } we took him up there	24
{C And } [ [ it does, + {E I mean, } it is, ] + it is ] not a reason.	9
I just tell the credit card company, don't pay the charge, # even though # they've already paid it.	24
Yeah.	15
it was just fabulous.	9
{C And } I think that's sort of unfortunate, # because # [ it doesn't, + it doesn't ] really help the cause in the long run <laughter>.	9
Uh-huh.	15
actually they're from Canada.	24
LITTLE MERMAID and PETER PAN -- -- I think [ are, + are  ] his two favorites that we've got <breathing>.	24
{C and } now we're looking at serious, -	26
{C and } I just, -	26
All right,	26
{C and } they had a real good time	24
{C And, } {F uh, } {D you know } we could learn  to talk about things	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } over there, {D you know, } every time we'd go [ and, + and  ] eat dinner or lunch or whatever we'd always have to ask for the check -- -- {D you know } <laughter> --	24
I don't think as far as the kids [ and, + and ] the house and everything -- -- are concerned, not from what I see --	9
{C So } the, -	26
I've heard, -	24
Uh-huh.	15
They did Johnny Elway to that.	24
{C But, } {F uh, } I still have elderly parents alive.	24
[ it's, + it's ] a different perspective on everything, too.	9
{C And } I think, personally, the drastic step has to be [ that, + {F um, } that ] you can't work if you continue taking drugs.	9
{C so. } -	26
We were talking about that just today.	24
yeah,	36
[ I, + I ] just think, {D you know } Marino will get better	9
{C and } the first thing [ the, + the ] old guy there  at the stand asked is what part of town we lived in because he said, {F uh, } [ I've got, + I've got ]  a dozen different varieties	24
{D see } I don't know if they were necessarily behind,	24
{D You know } {C and } now [ [ it's, + it's, ] + it's ] okay	9
Uh-huh.	15
it would be to our benefit to strengthen that country. Right on our borders.	9
{C and } they're trying to sell something	24
I find a lot of the cookbooks   [ that, +  I don't know, that ] you buy over the counter ask for really strange ingredients, or things I don't keep on hand all the time --	24
It was the network.	13
{D Well, } I go to school	24
I know [ it's, + it's ] a lot, {D you know } <clicking>, [ that, + {F uh, } that ] I feel [ like, + {D you know, } just like ] you said, that, there's just so much that you can do yourself.  That you take care of your own self that you don't need the money for -	9
{D Well, } I considered it last year	24
{D now } was that [ the, {F um, } {F uh, } green, + ] {F oh, }  {A I don't know, } some guy that was attacking women jogging?	7
[ Let's, +  let's ] make them pay as much as possible. Things like that.	24
you know, what are we doing for them,	12
{C and } I know, {F uh, }  in my children's case it was one where, {F uh, } pretty much up until the older of two was  [ in, + ] {F uh, } let's see, I guess basically starting junior high	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } after that, we either, -	24
new ones, {E I mean, } [ they, + they ] tend [ to, + to ]  be real tiny,  [ but that + ] {F uh, } especially in newer neighborhoods,	9
{C and. } -	26
{C so, }  other than, {F uh, } -	26
Yeah.	15
[ All that th-, +  most of the ] ones on the  list, I checked off stuff like football [ and, + and  stuff that [ I can, +   [ I, +  I ] would ] enjoy talking about	24
[ People, + people's ] personal schedules are so busy.	9
Are you familiar with that?	7
{C and } I assumed it was T I wide, {F uh, }	9
it looks like it's come close to that as it is.	9
I'm always amazed [ at + ] [ that, + that ] each candidate thinks it's going to be the people that come out that will vote for him, {D you know. }	24
{C and } I'm, -	24
{F Oh, } at least once a week.	24
Yeah,	36
Yeah.	15
<Talking>.	20
sure. #	15
Uh-huh,	15
{C And, } {F uh, } [ I've, + I've ]  really enjoyed that one since it came on.	24
<<Very faint>> Uh-huh.	15
That's right.	36
Yeah	15
what would you recommend?	39
{C and } [ you can, +  you can ]  flip through the commercials	24
{F Oh, } yes.	15
It's like this train.	24
Is it?	7
{D well, } I know they will,	38
it seems to me that you [ talk  longer from wh-, + ] you kind of yell into it.	9
I am not a member of the National Rifle Association	24
Uh-huh.	15
# I # [ say +  agree ] with you a hundred percent there <laughter>.	36
I have a, {F um, } -	24
Many more deaths have occurred in and dealing with coal plants then ever around nuclear plants.	24
{C and, } even though they do a lot of the work themself [ then + ] just buying the parts  and everything [ is, + is ]  pretty expensive.	24
Yeah,	15
yeah,	15
Yeah,	15
Yeah.	15
{D You know. } {C Because } it's not a person's fault that, {D you know, } people not buying or businesses [ are, + are ] not on the up and up all the time, {D you know. }	9
the man always gets that chore,	24
Yeah.	15
They refund the deposit which is anywhere from five to fifteen cents a container	24
Okay,	15
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
That's not really invading my privacy <laughter>.	24
# {D Well } good. #	21
[ I don't, + {F uh, } I would like ] to see the greatest improvement in management.	24
Yeah.	15
-- {C but, } I do feel like it's [ a, + an ] invasion of my space.	24
[ [ they, +  {F uh, } women ] +   {C because } they ] [ have choice +  are having ] children much later in life.	24
{C because } they had so many power lines down --	24
<Laughter> golf,	15
{F Um, } [ I, + I ] might buy the mother boards from Utah but then still have to pay Pennsylvania sales tax.	24
it's sor-, it's semireligious in some respects.	24
{C but } the guy that they messed over to get there or they stole something from, or beat to death	9
{C but } she's still on her own, {E I mean. }	24
{C so } I hate to spray them with anything.	24
-- {C but } -- -- I have an aunt who lived on her own until she was well in her nineties --	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but. }  What hobbies do you have?	39
I put mine in probably in November.	24
I have four sons scattered all over the country, and a [ f-, + few ] grandchildren.	24
{F Huh. }	15
{C and } even these buses, {F oh } lord, it real bad.    These buses in Raleigh,	9
Okay <laughter>.	29
[ [ That, +  that's, ] +  that's ] Julia Roberts'   new movie.	24
{F Oh, } I haven't seen that one yet.	24
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } I would have no idea <laughter>.	24
[  I, + I'm ] constantly going back and  forth.	24
Huh-uh.	15
you can go over there and lay on the beach	24
{C And, }  {F uh, } then it usually breaks back off again the next morning.	24
In some ways I don't like it because it's like  they're playing God.	9
Right.	15
We have a brick house	24
they came out with  a European racing, green, {F uh, } Miata that's a limited edition,	24
# {F Oh, } yeah.  #	15
{F uh, } things that you don't know -- -- {F uh, } [[ d-, + do, ] + do ] not worm their way around and influence other people or perhaps lead other people astray.	9
# What's, # -	26
[ that, + that's ] where your absolutely right is we've got to do something in that region to encourage, {F uh, } or [ [ to make, + to make ] him growing bananas profitable again, {E I mean. }	9
Uh-huh.	15
I'm really looking forward to it.	24
<Inhaling> {F Uh, } I'm not really sure how bad it is.	34
Yeah.	15
How do you spell that?	39
That's right.	36
{C but, } I'm up at my daughter's,	24
{C and } it was like, when our ancestors first came over.	24
{F Um. }	26
Yeah.	15
{C and so } the opinion of this career thing isn't all that it is cracked up to be	9
All the developers don't know what to do <laughter>.	24
{F uh, } I think his name was Bachman.	24
{C but } [ I, +  I ] don't know.	19
# [ {C but, } + {C but } ] # [ it's, + {D you know, } it's ] like where he was before I was only paying sixty three,	24
{C and } no one could make heads or tails out of some of them	24
we got that.	24
# Yeah. #	15
Yeah.	15
We didn't do all that -- -- {D you know. }	24
{F Oh, } yeah,	21
it's, we're doing it at N C State,	24
I don't read the Bible as much as I should	24
It seems that progressive, -	24
{D So. } <laughter> -	26
{D Well, } that's exactly what happens in government <laughter> all the time.	9
{C so. } Yeah --	26
{C and, } {F uh, } if you can find some place where those little sunfish are right around the shore where they can just pull in a line.	24
[ it's, + it's  ] no ones f-,	26
Yeah,	36
I've got a stack next to my bed <laughter>.	24
{E I mean, } it's either guilty or not guilty.	9
Okay,	15
[ I, + I ] know a lot of people around here sometimes have, {D like, } mothers or grandmothers -- -- that take care of their kids	24
Uh-huh.	15
-- it's what you do every day.	24
I think he did an excellent job in not being too much of a cop.	24
They get dominated by the Corvettes that are also in their class.	24
In fact, my problem, -	26
Yeah.	15
I talked to this old woman that was a retired administrator in Ohio one night about education.	24
{D now } this one was purebred	24
I think it's out of Dallas,	24
{C and } you watch them at home,	24
# Oh # .	15
{C and } for some strange reason those people think they need to get paid.	9
I hope it's  recording <laughter>.	24
what types of music do you like to listen to?	39
he's, {F uh, } {F uh, } south of Renner [ on, + on ] Custer.	24
They have one area in town where the people, -	24
[ It, + it ] is scary though, isn't it?	7
Yeah,	36
the premise of the story is that, {F uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, } [ you go to a pla-, + ] after you die you go to a place called Judgment City.	24
Do you all just start planning real far ahead of time?	7
[ {C or, } +  {C or } ]  they don't serve very much of the time	9
{C so, } {F uh, } -	26
# Uh-huh. #	15
they voluntarily give up their right to continue on with their happy life,	9
# Uh-huh. #	15
{F Um, } I guess there's been a lot of pressure  to, {F um, } do away with the C F C's in these spray bottles which, # has # been a real problem.	24
Do people actually pick the fruit and things?	7
Yeah,	15
-- {C but } then I just thought the food was  over priced for what it was.	24
it's probably going to be a very old used one.	24
{D Now } the interior,	24
{C So, } {F uh, } -	26
<Breathing> {C So } I think a person could work, <breathing> {F uh, } into the seventies, eighties, even nineties for that matter,	9
{C and } she didn't eat.	24
I went there looking at a used car	24
You mean in cable?	7
[ [ they, +   {F uh, } <lipsmack> {C and } they, ] +   they ] talk about too, the gangs spreading, {D you know, }	24
[ {C so, } + {D you know, } {C so } ] [ it's supposed to wash, + you're supposed to be able to wash ] it --	24
It is.	36
{F Uh, } you just, -	26
{C but, } {F uh, } {D you know, } I try to use that money for food [ mo-, + ]	24
# {C and } was, -	26
[ it, + it, ] -	26
{C and, } {F uh, } yeah,	26
I'll # take care of that <laughter>. #	24
{C So } that was, Dry,  but pretty even climate, wasn't it? Year round, fairly, Not wide fluctuations.	7
-- I don't remember.	34
{C and } I don't want them [ to, + {F uh, } to ] cut funding for welfare programs or anything.	24
I don't have the patience to read <laughter>.	24
{D you know. }  [ I did not, + I did not  ] go see FIELD OF DREAMS when it was in the theatre because I did not know it was any good.	24
{D well } is your, -	7
It seems like every year my employer just gives back, {D you know, } a little bit your tuition reimbursement.	9
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
it's on, {F uh, } -	24
Uh-huh,	15
{F Um, } September really was,	36
{C So, } I wish I could.	24
Yeah,	15
{C and, } they <laughter> {D you know, } -	26
{F Uh, } # {C and, } # -	26
<Sigh> {D Well, } I have, {F uh, } two kids,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
I think probably when I get system seven I may have to do that [ and, + and ] get [ another, + possibly another ] hard disk.	24
{F Uh, } {C and } you can, {F uh, } move them around and  stuff	24
{C But, }  {F um, } [ it's a real, + it's a real ] nice place to go and  camp,	24
# What an experience. #	21
I know it.	36
I think then that a life sentence to restitution is appropriate.	9
{F Oh, } {D well, } {D see, } now we need, -	24
{C and } you have to be there right after school or something like that,	9
I guess that's what concerns me the most.   Is [ they're, + they're ] so  unstable that somebody like that could make, {F uh, } decisions that would jeopardize a lot of people.	9
<<There are many breaks in the tape.>>	20
Oh.	15
They need to get a new photography method.	9
#Go ahead.#	18
[ That's a, + that's a ] good suggestion.	9
Yeah.	36
{E I mean, } people, {D like, } -	26
That's right.	36
Right.	36
No,	33
I do,	11
Uh-huh.	15
that's right.	36
{C So, }  he gets to go in and out whenever he wants to.	24
[ what, + {F uh, } what's ]  your experience been like?	31
Yeah,	15
{C and, } {F um, } I teach, {F uh, }  in a college,	24
I always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough, {E I mean, } to be doing what they're doing, {F uh. }	9
{D Well, } maybe it would.	34
{D Well, } see we have the testing already here.	24
[ I, + {D well, } I ] don't, because I work all day.	5
Uh-huh.	15
you can't really unload all your stuff.	24
How about you?	31
Yeah,	15
{D Well, } -	26
this man turned around and said, Could you all please save that for later.	24
No.	13
well [ [ t-, + {D see } that's, ] + that's ] why I'm glad my wife did too,	24
{D You know. }  It really  is,	9
{F Uh, } okay.	38
I think the automobile  definitely is an area and [ any, + any ] industry that burns, {D you know, }	9
They're probably picking up about half of it.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and then } he goes out for the day.	24
{C and } watch the cats tear it up.	24
{F Oh, } okay.	15
Doesn't matter where the boundaries are.   {F Um, } {D you know, }	9
this is the way of let's make fun of the teachers those are the people who can't do anything.	9
{F Uh, } [ how, + how, ] -	26
Pardon me?	14
I'm from here originally,	24
{F Um, } I guess I see overall beneficial, [ if, + if ] we're going from that point of view.	24
{D yeah, }  hopefully you have a lot to talk about in this one,	24
Okay.	38
Yeah.	36
{C And, } yeah,	15
{F Oh, } that's what I'm majoring in.	24
let's see.	17
{C and } it was redone before we moved in, which, -	24
{E I mean } [ they, + they're ] in school,	24
{D Like, } what is a book on your list,	39
Uh-huh.	15
{C But } yeah,	15
{D Now } where does the source light go?	39
I go down to Austin,	24
{C but } if it's, -	26
{C So } we're expecting our local economy to <breathing>, {D Well, } maybe not a boom,  but, {F uh, }  at least, recover to where we can all hold regular forty hour jobs still.	24
{C because } [ I, + when I ] make this chicken casserole [ [ I, + it, ] + it ] makes a real big casserole and then another one that I freeze.	24
Yes.	15
{C and } one of those was to Buffalo.	24
# Yeah.  #	15
<Breathing>  We were gone <laughter>.	3
I don't, -	26
are you a T I -er?	7
Yeah.	36
seems like he went to school at {D like } DeVry.	24
uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	4
{C And so } one thing that I'm very concerned with now is first of all health benefits	24
you go to visit them?	8
I made some of them with that hair	24
((   ))  {C So } we talked about the  Cowboys a little bit.	24
Right.	15
Yeah.	15
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] that it is [ a + <inhaling> a ] [ l-, + loss. ] [ I, + I ] think is that the Federal government will try to establish a mechanism [ [ ju-, + just ] to do + just [ that + ] [ in or-, + in order ] to ] gain the revenue that's being lost.	9
{C and } if you look outside, you would like  to go out and mow your lawn, if you could go out and buy a new spark plug,  or something along those lines,	24
Catch you later.	38
Yeah.	36
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Have a good day.	38
{C and } you have to try and take out some of that money.	9
then, {D so } {D like } your  pay, what kind of a percentage do you basically keep out that you think that, {D you know, }  will cover all of the expenses, kind of thing?	39
Bye.	38
[  I, + I ] wouldn't if I didn't have this car time ability probably -- -- because at night if I sit down, I'm doing something with the kids or -- -- just not sitting down at all <laughter>.	9
{F Oh, } yeah.	36
{F Um, } [ I've, + I've ] probably talked maybe to five people.	11
A boy and a girl?	7
{C So } they have to watch out who comes in,	24
Same [ as, +  as ] # any other part of the world, #	9
I guess it had been going on, maybe almost a year, # before # I retired,	24
it's one of those things where, if you're a grad student you can appreciate the statistics on -- -	24
[ {C and, } + {F um, } {C but } ] it's hard for him on Saturdays.	24
{C but } you, [ use, + {F uh, } thin ] it out a little bit. {F Uh, } or make it a little fluffier	24
{C And } until then I never paid attention to soap operas.	24
Yeah.	15
that has got to be a challenge sometimes.	9
{D You know, } {C and } that's kind of like today.	24
Now she's married to some guy in New York,	24
{F Um, } the only exercise program  I'm doing right now is walking.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And, } {F uh, } [ I, + as far as a high school course, I ] could see it as, {F uh, } maybe a [ social, + {F uh, } sociology ] course -- -- to where a student would get credits if they were to be involved with some kind of community type of program	9
[ We don't, + we don't ] usually cover ours.	24
Right,	36
{C So, }  we enjoy that,	24
[ {C So, } + {C so, } ] it was, {D you know, } two miles a day <laughter> to and from work.	24
And it would save the U S money in -- -- in the long run in how much they're trying to do,	9
At least you got a chance to out run them that way.	9
{F Oh, } on a lake,	22
{C So. } -	26
{D well, } actually, I had [ a, + {F uh, } a ] Dodge Omni at one point --	24
Where'd you get the car?	39
Yeah.	15
right <laughter>.	15
I don't know what,	24
I know.	21
# To use you mean,	22
They're expecting more or, uh, or just, uh, you know, -	9
{C and }  [ was to the point, + ] he was on probation,	24
huh-uh.	33
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } there was only one computer that had forty-eight K on it at the time.	24
What do you think about it?	31
You bet,	21
{E I mean, } {D you know, } our lives are on computers.	9
{C but } they're making money --	9
{C and } I miss the  ((   ))  seasons [ that, + {D you know, } that ] we used to get up there that you just don't have down here.	24
{F Uh, } okay.	29
{C So } first thing I think of is how easy would this, thing be to clean.	24
[ [ [ I, + I, ] + {F um, } I ha-, ] + I was ] on an H M O, {F uh, } up until last year -- -- [ and, + ] {F uh, } through work.	24
{F uh, } I notice in some of the sexual cases they've held up a great deal of privacy, which I support of course,	24
Yeah,	26
Uh-huh.	15
{D well } I do not like them	24
{C But, } {F uh, } it's kind of different.	9
{C But } [ tha-, + there's, ] -	26
{E I mean, }  [ they -- + -- I think they  ] give me a hard time,	24
{D Well, } really I'm supposed to hear today	24
# I think #  we have to accept the fact that whatever happens, we're going to have to bite the bullet.	9
You weren't sure exactly how it would get there,	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C and so, } that of course means that when it comes to the American League my favorite team is the Red Sox -- -- by default, because I went to college also in Boston.	24
{D Well, } do you use your computer for, {F um, } just things around the house, or in the  ((   )) . -	7
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } they're dangerous.	9
{C and, }  {F uh, } quite honestly, I, I have some little children	24
Yeah,	38
Right.	15
[ I, +  I'm, ]  {D you know, } -	26
{C but } it was satisfying.	24
Thanks a lot.	42
even # [ that, + that ] really, I think, I don't, -	26
Yeah,	15
{C and, }  {F uh, } [ we, + we ] dabble in it just enough to make both sides angry at us some how, some times,	9
Yeah	15
yeah	15
Yeah.	15
I think we just have to, -	9
[ there was no, + there was no ] comparison.  {F Uh, }	24
# {C so } # this isn't for her,	24
{C And } one, {F uh, } <lipsmack> -	26
just beca-, {D you know, } -	26
{F Um, } <lipsmack> {D you know, } when I first was applying for graduate schools, I applied to some big programs, {D you know, } in this area, like Stevens Institute of Technology, which is recognized in the Northeast [ as, + as, ] {D you know, } one step below M I T in a sense, {D you know, }	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C So } [ h-, +  he ] hasn't really gotten  into, {F um, } that yet.	24
[ we, + {F uh, } we ] lived out of state for a while and came back	24
[ I soon, +  I need ] a lot of repairs done [ on, +  on ]  this one	24
it wasn't a creek bed,	24
yeah.	15
[ I, + I ] feel foolish sometimes  because [ I, + I ] don't speak another language fluently	24
I work for the school district here,	24
Wow.	21
I have never been camping <laughter>.	5
{C but } we could find one.	24
{C and } the game started at seven	24
You can't afford to give more than a couple of seconds here and there.	9
{F Oh, } that would be great.	21
<whistling> I think it was, somebody was [ [ just (( scarcely )) + just, ] + just ] ripping the hell out of # [ someo-, + another person. ] #	24
{C But } we don't have a C D yet, do you?	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
{C and } the other one [ is, + the boy is, ] {F um, } guitar [ and, + and ] percussion,	24
Let me see if that clears this up.	37
{F Um, } is that typical, to only breed them once?	7
Yeah,	15
{C Because } I think what they often get used as is, {F uh, } almost like a very high level or long-term care [ for, + ] {F uh, } similar to a hospital.	9
<Laughter>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I have not gone back about it.	24
<Laughter>  Yeah,	36
Right.	15
{E I mean } the stuff I've read recently in Technology Review basically indicates that acid rain may be a little bit, {F uh, } overstated.  That a lot of the die off they've seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all.	24
Uh-huh.	15
it comes on {D like } at nine o'clock, at night	24
{C and } I think it's important,	9
{C and } it has a lot of muscle in it and a lot of, gristle where it attaches to the ribs,	24
{C Because } you can't see a car ahead of you,	24
[ {C And, } +  {F uh, } {C and, } ] true,	13
there's only one problem I have with the whole  thing though, [ th-, + ] is, {D you know, } when they do it, I think our biggest problem  is, {D yes, } [ the, + the ] crooks and what have you are going to get weapons  if the weapons are available.	24
Uh-huh.	15
I have a recipe that's <dishes> pretty good for that <noise>.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I have my house,	24
Yeah.	15
{C But } most of mine that I use is strictly gasoline.	24
Right.	15
{F Oh, } yeah.	36
{F Oh, } that's true,	36
[ {C And, } +  {C and. } ] Right.	26
{C but } we don't really use them a lot.	24
Uh-huh,	15
{F um, } up here some of the  state parks are really nice	24
Sure.	15
{C But, } yeah,	15
[ I, +  I ]  almost want to start a business doing it,	24
Yeah,	15
{C So, } -	26
{E I mean, } [ I, + I ] can see that research is needed	9
[ we don't, + we don't ] usually mix.	24
{C And, } it's a very complicated problem.	9
{C but, } {F um, } up until, {D gee, } maybe five or six years ago, I did a lot of it <throat_clearing> --	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } they, {D you know, } -	26
Yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
it's one that's, -	26
{C And } it was [ a, +  a ] cultural shock to me. # {F Uh, } in # terms of what I went through.	24
The devastation,	21
Was that Arnold Schwarzenegger?	7
Uh-huh.	15
<Noise> Not often.	40
[ I, + I ] think most employers would probably rather hire, {D you know, } [ a, + a ] three six [ in, + {F um, } <lipsmack> in ] history, {F uh, } to be a salesman than someone with a two oh in business administration.	9
{D Well } I'm going to try to  ((   ))  clean up the house after my two children for about an hour see if we can walk around.	24
I don't know.	19
We won't allow this in our neighborhood.	24
{C and, } -	26
{E I mean, } it seems like [ [ our, + our, ] + the ] prison systems, we can't seem to decide whether or not it's a reform system or penal system.	9
{C or, }  s-, {F uh, } -	26
# [ It, + it's  ] a small town.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } they show it in slow motion.	24
-- so she doesn't remember anybody --	24
No,	29
nobody, # wants to make the, nobody wants # to make the unpopular decision of going in and invading,	9
# It was just # the teachers themselves.	24
{F Oh, } yeah	26
{C and } it's kind of cold in the mornings	9
{F Oh, } that's pretty good size.	21
Are you there?	7
{F Uh, } {D see, } {E I mean, } my mom taught English as a second language	24
I read an article recently that, {F uh, } you have to  be very careful on the kind of paint you put on the ceiling in your bathroom because it does  tend [ to, + to ] peel or come off because of the [ moisture, + high moisture ]  content in your [ bath, + bathroom. ]	24
{E I mean } I realize that they are popular now,	9
They have the commercial on TV where  [ you can, + you can ] pull some seats out,	24
Yes.	15
It's a lot of fun.	9
Yeah.	15
that's terrible	21
Yeah,	36
{C And, }  of course, we always read a bedtime story at night,	24
{F Oh, } I didn't realize, -	21
{D You know, } {C so } I guess [ I, +  I ]  wish the companies like T I and a lot of others were more progressive -- -- in that respect #	9
# Sure. #	15
{C and, } -	26
Yeah.	15
{C and, }  {F uh, } really need a faster system.	24
{C but } I didn't care for it.	24
Yeah.	15
But, uh, that's really my only experience in the past year where I've had to take a product back because of a defect.	24
{C or, } -	26
Be interesting to see when, as Mexico develops industrially whether, you know, without, -	9
as much as I didn't like school when I was going through it, from my perspective now I can see that it's a lot better than what we have now.	9
Uh-huh.	15
I'll probably talk to you again.	9
{C and, } {F uh, } yeah,  {D you know, }	36
one of his favorite things is, {F uh, } -	24
I think, {F uh, } what I would like to see is, number one, completely getting rid of these victimless crimes.  {F Uh, } {A there's no reason to enforce those and spend time and money doing it -- } -- [ and, + and ] worry about these things where people are getting hurt.	9
[ [ I, + I, ] + I ] [ fi-, + find ]  myself going to work knowing [ that, + that ] there's a job about half done at home,	24
Uh-huh.	15
you'd have,	9
{D You know, } they leave themselves wide open so they can't be sued.	9
{C And, }  {F uh, }  it, -	26
I don't know.	19
Yeah.	15
I know,	21
maybe if they ever get to the point [ the biggest, + {D you know, } the biggest ]  (( outlaid )) expense has always been {C either } wars or defense.	24
{E I mean } we've got loads of foreign students --	9
I have to watch MURPHY BROWN	24
it depends.	24
I think it's good for kids to grow up around pets, [ as, + as ] long as they don't have any allergies to them or anything.	9
{F Oh, } I would imagine [ [ in, + {F uh, } {D you know, } in, ] + in ] Dallas they have plenty happening in Dallas to cover, that it gets hard covering all of the [ sub-, + suburbs ]	24
I wasn't really wa-, -	26
yeah.	36
It's like anywhere else.	9
{C and, } -	26
In the past we didn't have that problem	24
{D Well, } I am hoping one of these days I'll have the opportunity to catch a big catfish like that on, {F uh, } a rod and reel	24
-- {C and } [ it's, + it's ] interesting that a lot of the shows are that way,	9
Uh-huh.	15
because those things I think would just snap -- -- {D you know. }	9
I don't think most of our teachers, -	9
Have you?	7
# Uh-huh. #	15
{C and } he would just dance around  the floor	24
{D Well, } it's, {F uh, } it was sixteen inches long.	24
Boy, that sounds like, {F uh, } -	26
{C and } I'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn English and a second language.	24
{C but } yet they were having to deal directly [ with, + {F uh, } {D you know, } with ] [ the, + {F uh, } the ] local people.	24
Right.	15
{C But } my mother has really high cholesterol,	24
Yeah.	15
{C so } I'm <laughter> -- -- waiting for mine.	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ I, + I ] was trying to remember, there was a court case, {F uh, } here where I live, just a few months ago.	24
{C so } I imagine [ the, + the ] type of houses and, {F uh, } things like that are truly  different from area to area <laughter>.	9
I think it's so beautiful.	9
It's not necessarily prestige,	9
{D So, }  {F um, }  {D well } I guess that's about all we need to do, isn't it.	7
{C But } [ we both, + we both  ] feel much healthier, # much # healthier.	24
Oh.	29
Right.	15
{C but } we're real happy with them.	24
I love the class,	24
yeah.	15
There's always been a certain amount of crime in [ your, + {D you know, } your ] urban areas,	9
{C But, } {F uh, }  [ no, + no ] real association with T I other than being in the same [ industry, +  electronics industry. ]	24
Yeah.	15
It's God's country.	9
{C because } I know of somebody that tested for an airline  and  didn't get the job	24
[ {C and, } + {F uh. } {C And } ] she was like {F oh } God,  he does this all the time, {D you know, } where are you <<imitates yelling>>. {D you know, } screaming, J D	24
{C And then } gradually they started switching over to, {F uh, } plain rice, {F uh, } no gravy.	24
A lot of people don't even like to carpool.	9
{D Anyway, }  {C so } the kitchen was one of the rooms that got hit with that color.	24
Anytime I can honestly say no, or, throw the paper away, or, -	24
Understand.	21
At least we found something different <laughter>.	9
, [ I was in, + I was in ] Iowa awhile ago, and noticed that everything was an hour earlier,	24
-- that would be wonderful in these times <laughter>.	21
There was  cartoon in COSMO about a year or two ago	24
{C But } you knew when you moved in, you'd have to pay that, didn't you?	7
that they -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } never yet have I met anybody on the golf course that wouldn't allow me to join their twosome or threesome.	24
That's horrible.	21
[ Is that, + is that  ] what -	26
{D You know, } you can't roll around and tussle around with it like you can a dog or a cat	24
They were eight and a half by eleven	24
We've always measured things in the English system <noise> -- -- and, {D you know, } everything,  {D you know, }	24
<noise>.	20
Right,	36
that's officially.	36
you know, {D like, } how, {F uh, } [ these two, + there was {D like } three ] continents that were always fighting with each other -- -- right,	24
Yeah,	15
I'm pretty sure I did.	24
{C So } I go outside the area for that.	24
I think it's usually this time of year when we get some, just torrential down pours.	9
We're from San Antonio	24
[ [ it was +  {D like, } {F uh, } it was   a, ] +  it was a ] mystery.	24
Apparently the trucks that they had, {F um, } lined up, they needed the parts for, Saudi Arabia <laughter>.	24
It just keeps growing and growing	24
Why,	16
Yeah.	15
{C and } their (( belief ))  system and [ [ a-, + all ] their structured of theirs, + all the structures of their  ] society are gone, essentially.	24
Yeah.	15
{C but } [ I was, + I was ] able to convince him that it  would be cost effective and that our board presentations would be much better	24
that day, {F uh, } I was saying now [ he, + he's ] sick.	24
{C But, }  {F uh, }  {D you know, } once again, those things are not that accurate	9
{C And, } {F uh, } {C so } [ I'm, + I'm ] hoping I can  get her talked into it soon.	24
{C but } I'm going to vote each time.	24
{C and } he's been transferred to Germany for a while --	24
in -	26
For example, {F uh, } <lipsmack> {F oh, } -	26
# [ {C So  } + # -- -- {C but } ] that was a long time ago.	24
{C and } -- --  it's a [ real, + real,  ] -	26
[ [ [ I, + I, ] + I, ] + I ]  would be committed to that, becau-, -	9
somebody else answered the phone  and put my number in.	24
yeah	36
Right.	15
I didn't <noise>  know that.	24
{C So, }  I don't know,	19
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] she won't do it in the summer  because her kids are home from school.	24
I don't think you can get dual side air bags.	24
When we were, -	26
{C but } a little bit [ from  three, +   {D you know, } from thirty ] million dollars or  thirty-five mil-, <breathing> -	24
Okay.	29
# {C but } # you don't feel stuffed and miserable.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Are you still there?	7
{F Um, }	26
I really do.	11
{C but, } as far as, {D you know, } {F uh, } -	26
{D well, } no,	32
{E I mean, } {F uh, } -	26
{D Well, } it was good to talk to you.	38
# {D you # know, } we don't make a [ trip, sixty-five, eighty, + {D you know, } sixty-five to eighty  ] <<sound fading>> miles.  Depending how far in Dallas it is.	24
I've always thought, {D you know, } it would be really tough.	24
Uh-huh.	15
I'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask <laughter>.	24
Uh-huh.	15
okay,	17
{C But, }  {F uh. } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C so. } -	26
They're, {F uh } -- --  (( speci-, )) -	26
Give an incentive.	24
Yeah,	15
You just couldn't get out there.	9
I think, {F uh, } {D you know, } -	26
That's the major thing.	9
what else for catering.  {F Uh, }	17
that'd work for me,	21
{C and, } *[[slash error]] {F Oh, } okay.	13
{C And so, } one day I got up and thought {D well } I will just go casual and you know that I called on a guy wearing exactly that, bib overalls,	24
Wow.	21
or do they.	7
{C and } the dog [ never, + {D you know, } he treated ] it like a milk bone	24
Yeah.	36
Uh-huh,	36
Right.	15
they don't have the history of breaking down or things like that, that would go wrong  would definitely not be considered disposable.	24
I take it you live in the Dallas area.	8
Right.	15
I thought that might be kind of fun to do.	9
Yes,	15
that's what it was.	24
I may have referred to a  couple of them,	24
Uh-huh.	15
we played Christmas about an hour out in this mall.	24
{C But } they showed  these rooms [ on, +  {F uh, } {D you know, } on ] the news	24
{D well, [ } that's, + that's, ] -	26
{C but, } # {F uh, } # -	26
{D Well, } more or less.	3
Unfortunately that kind of thing is not limited to <lipsmack> a big city like Los Angeles.	9
{C But } now I think there are tests that can be conducted, {F uh, } to tell whether or not the puppies [ have the, + have it. ]	24
Nice talking to you too.	38
You know, -	26
{C but, } {F uh } -- -- [ they, + they ] put her at the end of a hallway,	24
No,	33
I think some of the tones of [ the, + the ] daily prime time is questionable,	9
{F Oh, } I know,	24
{C And } the A C L U is going to get after them and have a lawsuit. Which is going to take twenty years to resolve, {D you know. }	9
<Breathing> Yes.	36
{F Uh, } she's not here anymore --	24
{C so } I better not do it.	25
Yeah.	15
those are good products also.	9
{C but } it's just on my mind,	24
# {F Oh, } # is that right?	12
y-, -	26
<Laughter> Yeah.	15
[ It, +  it ] astound,	9
Oh.	15
{C and } it was, {F oh, } something.	24
Right.	15
[ That's, + {F uh, } it's ] interesting.	21
{C but } she took them all down to that Dallas Shelter place.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } we're hardly ever at home,	24
{D Well, } you know why, because I grew up in North Carolina,	24
Yeah.	15
# What # would you start cutting f-,	39
# {F Oh, } Mother Macree.  #	21
{F Oh, } we've had eleven days in a row over ninety.	24
you have, -	26
yeah,	26
The only way I can see it is that if they really suspect a person of using it, then they have the right to go ahead and prove it	9
That's the type of thing you cross your fingers and are glad when that happens.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } yeah.	36
[ I'd, + {D you know, } I, ] -	26
{F Uh, } {D you know, } to, -	26
Yeah,	15
-- [ {C and, } + {C and } ] probably you're right.	9
-- {C and, } {D you know, } [ we h-, +   we had ] a neighbor in Nebraska when we lived there that had, {F uh, } Brittany Spaniels	24
[ {C And, } +  {C but } ] as you pointed out, [ I, + I ] think the real problem is the low pay child facilities	9
I'm in Richardson.	24
It's worse than a rose bush.	9
Yeah,	15
{C and } we moved here from Houston [ in, + in, ] {F uh, } July	24
{D you know. } [ [ What's, + {F uh, } what's, ] +  what's ] really happening here.	16
She was inaugurated in January,	24
{C and then } I usually end up flipping through  C N N and HEADLINE NEWS during the evening.	24
<Static>.	20
do you work for Texas Instruments?	7
Real good idea.	21
they sing songs on there	24
Uh-huh.	15
# I # think that's mostly, -	9
{F Oh, } uh-huh.	15
I think news today, {F um, } it's kind of losing its importance.	9
# It really is a great place. #	9
What are your hobbies?	39
Yes,	15
[ I, + I ] actually take both newspapers on the weekends.	24
most of the courses have a, {F uh, } two day advance tee time you have to call,	24
{D Well, } I think so.	9
{C and } one's an hour	24
{C But, } -	26
Yes <laughter>.	4
{C And, } I think a great number of students who got word of it and participated in general and voiced who heard about the program.	9
have you seen all those pictures that they're going to put out there?	7
Yeah.	15
{C And } the parents are saying, Hey, wait a minute,	9
# Right,	15
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
[ I don-, + I don't ] know how people do it with one,	24
{F Uh, } {C and } [ I've, + I've ]  said this very often	24
{C but } Massachusetts [ wasn't, + {A when Dukakis was there, anyway, } wasn't ] in that great shape financially.	9
Right. #	13
{D Well, } it just depends on where you go,	24
I absolutely loved it.	24
especially in large corporations.  You can really, {D you know, }  wind up [ getting, + ] having, {D you know, } real problems I've found out.	24
{C but } whether it's something that they can put [ to, + to ]  economic use later on is a different subject.	9
{C And } I made a necklace that I saw in a gallery for three hundred twenty dollars <noise> <swallowing>.	24
Really.	15
I had not heard anybody talk about it.	24
Right.	15
# <laughter>. #	20
Yeah.	4
{C And } they all seem to go together.	9
pretty much.	11
{C but, } not only don't kill them, bless them.	25
Yeah,	36
Uh, we're, our, our, we won't have any more licensed drivers for about thirteen years.	24
# Uh-huh.  #	15
{C So, } {F um, } I'll be able to keep that up a little bit.	24
I think it's a little bit  late in the season for them to assign us -	9
they are.	36
Really.	12
{C And, so. } -	26
No,	13
Neighborhoods aren't neighborhoods any more.	9
{C And } I was told you don't need as much pay as I have because your children are older than my children,	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
{D like, } {E I mean } they  have, {F um, }  (( better )) , -	24
I'm an engineer,	24
{C And } I think it's great,  but if [ you, + you  ] have a family, I think you owe the family a responsibility.	24
Yeah,	36
that's not the tools of your trade,	24
{C and } I can call them back <laughter>.	24
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] cultural diversity is just something we really don't understand	9
Yes.   *[[slash error]] Yeah    *[[aa]]	36
-- {C and } you just -- -- go out, and do the entire yard,	24
Yeah.	15
It, {F uh, } really is [ very, + very  ] interesting.	9
Some place south, and warm,	24
<Sniffing>.	20
are you willing to compromise a little [ and, + and ]  [ [ pay, + pay ] some, + take some  ] of that money out of your pocket  and pay for good quality education.	16
Yeah	15
{C and, } you usually  notice, {F uh, } a lot of problems at the beginning and then things kind of iron out, to where, there's fewer problems.	24
{C and } the, -	26
# {C And, } {F uh, } # -	26
Boy [ they d-, + they really don't ] want to come out of the water	9
{D like, } [ if, + if ] [ our, + our ] generation, -	9
<Laughter>.	20
<Laughter>.	20
{C But } like you, unless you have a pool in your backyard, it is kind of hard to get to do that -- -- very often.	24
Yeah.	15
[ I, +  I ] didn't do that thank goodness,	24
{F Uh, } I've got, {F uh, } five stickers here from T I,	38
# They raise them.  #	2
{C and } that sort of  makes [ a, + {F uh, } a ] glaze, that sticks to [ the, + the ] vegetables,	24
{D Well } the one that we had just didn't want any part of that.	24
{C and } I saw that, it didn't stop crime in that state.	24
I like [ your, + ] up there in Plano, that, {F uh, } Country Steak House.	24
{D Well, }  [ [ I + {D like, } I, ] + [ I just, + I just ] ] bogused on all my homework	24
{C So } I don't think that they deserve anything less <laughter>.	9
[ [ what do, + what do, ] + what do ] you think we can do to solve the crime in America?	31
Yeah.	4
# Yeah,	15
{D You know, } it happens a lot of times	24
It's human rights in the sense,	9
# {C Or, } # {F uh, } sometimes there's, {F uh, } letter to the editor about me	24
[ Don't, + don't ] ask me <laughter>.	34
[ It's actually, + it's  ] about sixteen and a half percent, which is pretty good, <talking> as far as credit cards go.	24
Okay	15
Bye.	38
{C and } the little kids would have nothing.	9
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	36
it starts on Friday and  goes through Sunday,	24
Yeah,	15
{D Well, }  ((   ))  the Chernobyl accident, {F uh, } -	24
Thank you very much.	38
# {F Oh, } sure.  #	36
Oh.	15
I know that's kind of old,	9
an, -	26
{E I mean, } {F uh, } I think [ that, + {F uh, } that ] a player ought to hit a home run if he's  got the pitch to do it,	9
Uh-huh.	15
{D well, } it's not really late into the summer,	24
{C and } they do the same old things they did in high school  and,*[[needs slash because following utt by B repeats utt of A; is not necessarily the intended end of this utt]] Same patterns of behavior, [ same, +  {F uh, } same ] socializing,  same exact crowd that they hang with	24
{F Oh, } really.	15
{C and } [ if they're, + {D you know, } if they're ]  on some kind of, {D you know, } [ contol-, +  controlled ] substance then, {D you know, } it  kinds of takes away from the job of, {D you know, } the supervisor or manager type person,  {D you know, } who is able to evaluate them.	9
{C But } we like our area.	24
I know I don't.	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } generally it paid everything,	24
next year I, -	26
I saw that,	24
[ if, + if ] somebody's about [ to, + to ] clobber you, the first thing they do is sort of say, {D well, } {D you know, } [ we're, + we're ] ashamed, we're not going to do that anymore.	9
We didn't do the sentencing.	24
{C but } it's probably not advertised as such, is it?	7
{C And then } as they got older, they went to, {F uh, } I preferred to call them schools	24
Yeah,	26
{F Oh, } right,	15
{C and } if that doesn't work, to take it to the whole church.	25
Right.	36
<Children>.	20
<Throat_clearing> Uh-huh,	15
Exactly.	36
{F Uh, } {D so, } -	26
Yeah,	15
{C and } she's got [ a, + {F uh, } a ] live out nanny.  {F Um, }	24
# [ I thought you were going to say there # -- + -- I thought you were going to say there ]  was a snake <laughter> in the weeds <laughter>.	24
I'm trying to think of his name and, {F uh, } what they put, {F uh, } him through in # regards to, # -	9
We just, {F oh, } just do various things, nothing really.	24
{C And } now I see -	17
{D actually, } [ I, + I ] agree that <laughter> that's an interesting thing.	24
<Laughter>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
[ [ [ [ I'm not, + I'm, ] + I'm, ] + I'm just, ] + I'm north ]  of Addison actually.	24
I'm trying to think the last actual book I read that wasn't, -	24
Yeah	15
{C And } that's mostly flat.	24
I like watching the T V for things that are interesting,	24
it's like sixteen hundred days or  something.	24
[ Mainly because, I, + a lot of it has to do, I ] think with more women working --	9
Wow.  That's [ a, + a ] big job.	21
{C And, }  {F uh, } that, basically, is the extent to which [ our, + our ] family has been directly, {D you know, }	24
Uh-huh.	15
it helps mature them a little bit, and helps them understand the world, the way it really is.	9
# [ They're not, # + they're not  ] my favorite totally.	24
If you compare [ the, + {D like } the ] people [ that could have, + that could have ] sent their kids to private schools and [ the people that, + {D you know, } the people that, ] {F uh, } did send their kids # to private # -- -- schools.	24
{C and, } {F uh, } I live in motor home,	24
Right now I'm busy chasing my kids.	24
[ I don't, + I don't ] really know if some of the poor judges that are trying to decide how it should be divided.	24
{C but } he goes, {F um, } [ every, + every  ] day,	24
-- you've got to have something to -- -- add to it or something --	9
{C but } I don't know who it was.	24
in our case where we knew we were buying a copy -	24
{C so } anything like manuscripts or computer paper or  so-, things like that goes in those boxes,	24
We haven't quite decided if I'm going to, -	24
{C and, } -	26
{F Uh, } that's true.	36
{C and } usually they are the four bedroom, {F um, }	24
[ [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C or, } ] +   {C or, } ] {F uh, } if it's a corporation,  that was, {F uh, } {D you know, } [ har-, +  harming ] some individual or something like that,  they get very much, {D well, } {D you know, } -	24
it's probably a half a dozen companies around the world that are making those mother boards, the main computer, the circuit board.	24
That sounds nice.	21
{C But, } <laughter> that was our experience	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ I want to, + the next car I get I want it to ] be automatic.	24
exactly. #	36
Nursing is.	9
{D well, } nice to talk to you.	38
# No # .	33
Uh-huh.	15
[ They, + they ] say it's what makes him happy is to give us D A D -ers grief,	24
{C And } I saw incidences in the hotel where I just wanted to go  over and crawl in the corner and say, {F oh, } my God	24
<Chiming> Yeah,	15
[ [ I, +   I guess, ] +  I, ] -	26
{C And } we get each other down the street.	24
{F Um, } let's see now	17
[ {C And then, } + {C and then, } ] {F uh, } <lipsmack>, {F uh, } the blond headed girl that used to be on NEWHART.	24
{C and } have a happy Thanksgiving.	38
It made no sense.	9
Uh-huh.	15
No,	36
# Yeah,	36
{C and } she's, {F uh, } sedentary all day long -- -- so when she gets home she likes to mow.	24
I was seeing what they was banging on.	24
Yes.	36
It's really <laughter>, -	24
yeah,	36
{D [ You, + you ] know } Magic was a  franchise for the Lakers -- -- and, {D you know, } {F uh, } Bird  [ for the, + for the, ] {F uh, } Celtics	24
I don't think there's any clear pick, {D you know. }	9
it's just, -	26
{F Uh, } through Nancy Dahlgren.	24
{C And }  ((   )) . -	26
that's true.	36
(( {D Well, } the ))  ROAD and TRACK was talking about that [ this, + ] apparently General Motors has some, {F uh, } -	24
I do not know if you listen to him or not,	8
I wasn't quite sure of it,	24
[ Really, + {E I mean, } he really ] has become [ a, + a ] very decent fielder.	24
# Something.  #	2
I don't play any.	24
Yeah,	15
{E I mean, } the thing [ is + is ] that, {D you know, } it's like  you might be standing somewhere, right,	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } Gorbachev seems to be going back on some of the things that he's been trying to push.	9
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
{C and } it is easier to raise a family as translators.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } they would tell the parents what they did that day.	24
Uh-huh.	15
-- that's where we always go,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } just an amateur singer.	11
uh-huh,	36
In I B M, you can get certain points --	24
{C or, } -	26
# Yeah. #	15
Yeah,	15
{C and, }  {F uh, } I liked the smaller cars,	24
{C and } I was waiting for the  whole house to collapse, and, {F uh, } I was reading DUNE. Which seeming rather ironic.	24
Did you have any  dealings with the, {F uh, } underwater sound reference laboratory in Orlando, Florida?	7
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Not anything, {D you know. }	24
[ I, + I ] really like that concept.	9
Yeah,	15
{C and } my husband even was kind of woozy after that because I'm sure he breathed it <laughter> --	24
# yeah. #	26
Television, -	26
Right.	15
{C and, }  {F uh, }  we stripped it all the way down and  refinished it	24
Right.	15
Yeah.	4
My fiancee is down there <laughter>.	24
I have three left in the house.	24
{C But } the thing about the child care [ I, + {D you know, } I ] have friends that struggle financially [ {C and, } + {C and } ] they both do have to work.	24
{F Oh, } there are a couple of Newberry Award winners.	24
what do I do now?	38
{D Well, } good for you.	21
It is,	36
{E I mean, } [ the, + the ] northern colleges are very different  than the southern colleges, I think.	9
That's not real.	9
all that began back there,	24
[ there, + there's  ] a lot of times though, {F uh, } you get those calls [ and, + ]  {D you know, } when you're sitting at home wanting to relax [ or, + or ] whatnot	24
Yeah.	15
I have probably planted <sigh>, {F oh, } around here,  {F um, } maybe six hundred bulbs.	24
{D well, } -	26
Uh-huh,	15
{C And } that [ would result in some, + {F uh, } could result in more ] equitable distribution of money	9
Yeah.	15
{C and } he was so funny.	24
# Don't want to admit it yet.  #	2
yeah,	38
{C And, } {F uh, } we live near Coit and Legacy in a relatively new development that just has gone in about two years ago.	24
It's good to talk to you.	38
-- yeah,	36
{F Huh, } {D well, } I suppose you were surprised.	22
{C and } Mom said it was absolutely just a wonderful experience.	24
{C And then } there is wild blackberries there too.	24
# Yeah	15
{F Uh, } <laughter> {E I mean } [ I, + I ]  live in a nice area	24
I think, I was watching something the other day about that {D actually } on, {F uh, } a news special or something like that	24
# {F Uh, } #	26
thank you,	42
{C but, } {F uh, } I think that they have [ a, + a ] lower  [ (( racial ))  of injuries, + ratio of injuries ] in baseball.	9
Yeah,	15
make them do civic duty whatever,	18
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] you know what?	16
in fact, we put in [ some, + {F uh, } some ]  more roses yesterday.	24
{C and } the other one, of course can't do the same thing.	24
You do the same.	38
{D Well, } I, -	26
{C so } [ I, + <laughter>  I ] should get all [ I  (( can )) + ] , my news [ from the new-, + from the ] T V.	24
{C but } {F um } I think that -	26
{C but } I'm still going to college.	24
No.	15
(( Hit ))  the bags.	15
I get # in, # from work	24
{F Uh, } communications.	24
{C And, }  {F uh, } [ they have a, + we have a, ] {F uh, } I think it's three bedroom or two bedroom, {F uh, } condominium, which will sleep, <inhaling> I do not know, quite a few  (( about )) , six or eight.   {C And, }  {F uh, } cause it's got, {D you know, } pull out couches and  all that,	24
{F Oh, } that's neat.	21
Uh-huh.	15
Wow.	21
{F Oh, } boy.	21
{D You know, } once [ they, + they ] have been arrested	9
We don't get a, {D you know. } -	26
[ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C so } ] I try to spend as much time as possible with them.	24
[ I don't, + I don't ] like Stephen King.	24
{E I mean} there are other things that you could go do.	9
{C So, } [ [ it is like, + I, ] + I ] lift weights with about the same curl weight as I do the squats with.	24
{C And } [ I'd, + I ] think when I was real little I probably had a finger in on that every time he did it -- -- and had to be out there and watch and that type of stuff.	24
{C and, } {C and } they look real pretty after the rain.	24
{C And } I would probably bring something in showing that I had been to such and such hospital for help or, {D you know, } # Whatever # the twelve month program.	24
{F Uh, } {C so } I manage to fit in my gardening chores afterward,	24
-- {C and } it really did seem to be a worthwhile organization,	24
You don't have any kids you want to send over here?  <Laughter>.	7
{D well, } [ I'm, + I'm ]  working for T I, Texas Instruments, down here.	24
you'll have a bud the evening before,	24
{C But, } -	26
{C But } they should not have a one-on-one relationship with the people making the decisions that affect them.	9
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	4
However, they could not tell [ the jud-, + the jury ] that during the trial because all three of them were in appeal.	24
--  i-, -	26
that's not too far from were we live,	24
They may have improved it considerably.	24
{C but, } {F uh, } I'm saying certainly at work I have no problem with it.	24
{D Well, } [ you, + you ] should have a lot of information on a budget, then, if you're, {F uh, } -	8
{C And so, } {D you know, } you could also apply the  magazines toward that.	9
{C but } [ the, +  the ] house is real small --	24
{C and } of course while I'm doing it I feel pretty good,	24
Yeah.	15
I have never gone to a restaurant, and not just been  so full,	24
{C So } it's kind of,  {F uh, } -	26
I see.	15
{C and } it would never sell for three hundred forty thousand dollars.	9
{C And, } -	26
Okay,	15
Yeah,	36
((   ))  <<very faint>>.    *[[slash error]] Uh-huh.    *[[slash error]]	20
Right.	36
-- and, uh, that was a great little car.	24
Yeah.	15
It's mostly, {D you know, } -	9
Yes,	36
{D Well, } [ it, + it ] all paid off.	24
Funny thing is [ the news, + the national news ] how they covered it. {F Uh, } <lipsmack>	24
# {F uh, } I # think, [ [ given, + {F uh, } given, ] + {D well } given ] that there are so many people who don't have health insurance.  It's probably a real smart thing, # at # least to have some basic coverage for everyone.	9
Yeah,	15
Up until, -	26
{C but } I don't know who won,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
What about your family.	31
allergy medicine's really, {F uh, } expensive	24
{F Oh, } my goodness.	21
We don't really have enough plastic to mess with,	24
{D Well, } speaking of pets, I'll tell you, [  my, +  my ] kids are older now,	24
{C but, }  {F uh, } this dog, Dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like  what do I do now,  as he's floating down the river then finally discovered  that he could swim and, {F uh, } actually paddled up against the current  and, {F uh, } made it back to the shore and  climbed up	24
{C or, } -	26
Sure.	15
-- {C and, }  {F um, } I don't like them as well except, it wasn't really a fair comparison because those were automatics,	24
[ [ I, + I, ] + I ] like  that,  (( because [ there's, + there ] are )) , -	24
<Throat_clearing> Right,	36
I think, {F uh, } they do the whole with, {D you know, } paying,	24
they're a lot of fun.	24
I know our children mostly are scattered out at a distance,  so we really don't have that even.	24
yes,	15
But, -	26
{C and } when she <laughter> heard the topic, she said, capital punishment,	24
{C And } it's [ [ n-, + o-, ] + one ] of the things that it's used for, primarily, is for demographic, {F uh, } research.	24
{C so } -- -- the DECORATIVE WOODWORKING has just been a  great, great help.	24
Yeah,	15
You might want to, -	18
{C but } it's a place in Arlington,	24
{C and, }  {F uh, } the cost of living here in California is, {F uh, } I would say rather pathological <laughter>.	24
{D you know, } they'll show you [ tho-, + ] [ to encourage + <sniffing>,  to encourage ] recycling.	24
I just, {D you know, } -	26
Uh-huh <<faint>>.	15
{F Uh, } it's got an office down here [ [ in, +   {F uh, } in, ] +  near ] Duncanville	24
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] my projects had to do with acrylic painting,	24
by the time you've finally got down to it, -	9
Right.	15
Philadelphia was, {F uh, } favored by one point over Chicago and  the Lakers one point over Golden State, and Detroit by five over, {F uh, } Boston <<pause>>.	24
[ I think, + I think ]  capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for the kind of people where we say, {D you know, } this sort of person is just not acceptable to our society	9
{D you know, } [ when they thought, + {F uh, } they thought ] that Nicaragua, if you gave them a free election, they would vote for the, -	9
[ It was, + there was ] too many children per person.	24
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] there's some, {F um, } -	26
# yeah. #	15
{D you know, } like the A -s [ [ had, + they had, ] + they just had ] it all that one year.	24
it, {F uh, } -	26
{F Oh, } <laughter> [ I am, +   after our last summer's vacation I am ] antibeach.	24
I'll bet it is.	21
I'm looking forward to it.	24
{C And } I believe if you don't have a punishment befitting the crime, there's -- -- not any deterrent <laughter>.	9
Uh-huh.	15
[ I, + I ] just turned twenty-three, {F uh, } # April # twentieth,	24
again I  don't watch T V news that much now.	24
{C but } I think they should still go back	9
I use to play soccer a lot in high school,	24
Right.	15
-- {C and } [ I, + I ] think they burn a lot there, too.	9
{C But } I'm now in Palo Alto, California which is, I think, the recycling capital of the world.	24
{C And } I think that more and more the attitude's getting that [ a + ] way.	9
She never had to worry about taking anybody to child care because there was always somebody there older to deal with them,	24
We've got all these boxes in our garage for, {D you know, } green glass and  clear glass and plastic and  everything.	24
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } they saw the husband, # get, # -	8
I think mostly, we would want to receive it.	9
{C And } if we do that, -	26
you know what I'm saying?	7
Yeah.	15
It sure is.	36
{C and } [ it's -- + -- it's ] like, {F uh, }  yes,	24
uh-huh.	15
[ {C and } if, + {C and } ] they lay on these little mats,	24
What kind of cats are they?	39
# As equals. #	2
{C and, } I think that [ that's a, +   that's a ] symptom of our society,	9
We're {D like } in the bottom of the fourth year of drought, # up # here	24
{C and } the public schools here are, pretty good.	24
What a nightmare <laughter>.	21
uh-huh.	15
[ {C And, } + {C And } ] [ I just, + I'm ] not a women's libber.	24
{D Well, } preceding criminal record,  according to the judicial process has nothing to do with the current crime.	24
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } it does.	36
Yeah,	15
Sometimes called the dismal science.	24
Oh.	29
{C and } we can put full size cards in there.	24
{C and } -- -- {D you know, } when they had [ that, + the ] Elvis Presley music # and stuff like that. # And that kind of rock and roll	24
Yeah.	36
{F Um. }	15
<Laughter>.	20
it's hard to follow.	9
or do they both get served?	7
Yeah.	36
# {F Oh, } # you don't get to see any of # yours very often. #	22
# Yeah. #	15
I'm just a weekend cyclist.	24
{E I mean, } the, {F uh, } car air conditioners is -- -- one of the major leaking sources of, {F uh, } the, {F uh, } freon. Which is one of the major [ [ flor-, + chlorofar-, ] + fluorocarbons. ]	24
No.	33
Anything that I could be put aside into savings is going for interest on those cards.	24
I enjoy softball,	24
okay.	15
Yeah.	15
I can't remember what food it was	24
P E R E T T I.	24
That's  [ a, + why it ] hasn't made all that much difference is because [ the, + with the ] civil service, that [ you could take, + you could take ] your vacation in increments of one hour --	24
Yeah,	4
-- Madison has one of the nicest, {F uh, } bike, {F uh, } road, {F uh, } sharing programs [ of, + of  ] any city in Wisconsin --	24
{F Uh, } we're supposed to talk about the elderly now, I guess, {F uh, }	18
{F Oh, } that's a good school.	9
Fast <laughter>.	22
[ He, + he's ] liking this free time {D actually } <noise>.	24
{F uh, } <lipsmack> {D golly. } What's this white powder [ [ that, + that, ] + {F uh, } that ] you mix with water -- -- and gives a thick sauce?	39
they have one character on there	24
Yeah.	15
# you can't always get in when you want too	9
# Yeah,	15
{C So } that's what they need, {D well, } [ it, +  {F uh, } they ] said something to improve voting.	9
# Maybe not, {F huh. } #	2
I agree you. -	36
Yeah.	15
{C and, }  {F uh, } -	26
[ He, + he ] remembers lots of snow <laughter>.	24
{C and, } {F uh, } he knows where our yard is	24
<Throat_clearing>.	20
[ {C So, } + {F uh, } {C but } ] [ I, + I ] am ready for a little bit of the cooler weather and not so much in the nineties -- -- but something like, -	24
a lot of times I think it's our own fault.	9
# We don't either. #	5
# Yes.  #	15
I really just started.	24
{C and, } {F uh, } I had opportunities in high school, to work in some programs, {F um } --	24
they're hospitals that  they're, {F uh, } # agreeing with, {F uh, } T I that they'll be a certain rate, {D you know, }  for rooms and care and all that kind of stuff to keep [ co-, + {D you know, } costs ] down.	24
# {F Oh, } yeah. #	15
Yeah.	15
{C But } I would definitely do it, -	9
{F Uh, } I really don't have a routine.	24
Right.	15
{C So } you just moved away a year ago?	7
{F Uh, } {C and then } of course another hour to get back home.	24
Yeah,	15
Some of them are just really rough.	9
you don't just make the dinner,	9
Right.	15
No.	33
# <Laughter>. #	20
{C And } we have a lot of trees in our yard	24
{C and } I would really hate to be in a position to have to find child care <laughter>.	24
Software design engineer, [ so, + ] as they call it,	24
{C and } we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough to buy whatever we wanted -- -- for the day <laughter>	24
Where is, -	26
my husband would love to have more.	24
we need to discuss the voters. On a national and a local level.	18
{C so } that's nice.	21
[ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C but } ] it's unusual.	9
Uh-huh.	15
-- [ it hurts, + it hurts ] real bad.	24
I didn't see it,	24
That's right.	21
{F Oh, } oh.	15
{C so, } -	26
{C and } [ I still +  even then I was  [ so, + so ] disgusted with it [ I, + I ] ] tried to read, I don't remember which other  one it was,	24
[ She's, +  [ o-, + ] {E I mean } she's ]  [ that, + this ] young	24
I don't know.	19
yeah.	4
I think  a lot of the commentators on, {D like } the major networks, {D like } right, it's kind of appropriate  right now because of the election stuff going on,	9
{C So, }  {F uh, } what kind of home repair work have you done?	39
{F Oh, } really.	15
[ you're, + you're  ] certainly in the majority -- -- {F uh, } at least in this country.	24
yeah.	26
Yeah,	4
If they didn't have to, {D you know, } go into a kitchen -- -	9
{C And }  we <breathing>, -	26
{C And } only now they're getting that put in cars.	24
{C and then } it's got {D like } a trough underneath her --	24
Yeah,	36
High schools, I'm not too sure.	24
# I was # twenty-seven when I got married	24
Gee.	21
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } you'd have to. -	24
Uh-huh.	15
and then I went back and got the other one and put that in the, passenger seat and drove that one home.	24
{C But } I would love to, {F uh, } go into the space shuttle some day and, {F uh, } just see, {F uh, } {D you know, } the earth and the different planets and  things like that.	24
-- we buy it,	24
<Breathing> {D Well, } you know what's going to happen there,	9
{C but } my husband  and I have different hobbies.	24
I don't know.	24
{C and so } many of the people, even the professional people [ were, +  boy, they were ]  so against them doing that, {D you know, }	24
{C So, } [ it, + it  ] is like dance,	9
{D well, } maybe,	40
I just ended up using it.	24
It's, -	26
<Laughter> Who wins?	39
{C Or } if they've sent you [ a, + {F uh, } a ] number that you can use.  {D You know, } [ a, + a ] personal identification number -- -- that you can use in the, {F uh, } impact machines or whatever, [ you, + # you ] can do # that.	24
I need to go help my daughter do something,	38
{D Well, } you just have to ban the smoking [ to their + -- -- to their ] little room that they want to, -	9
# {C and, }  # {F uh, } I didn't have kids for four and a half years	24
Right,	36
{C and, } I'd like to think that it's quite low, at least in this country.	9
{C But } they are amazing.	9
{D Well, } [ I'm, +  I'm ] happy we got through.	24
We're talking -- -- these kids are fourteen years old.	24
<laughter>  No,	36
{C And } very often we'll, find a place that we like	24
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ]  {D you know, } if you're going to be jogging on the side of the road, [ that's, +  that's ] even more miserable.	9
{F Um. }	15
Yeah,	15
{C and. } {F Oh, } I do too.	13
Yeah,	4
#Right.#	15
He's a laborer.	24
my only consideration [ were, +  were, ]  {D you know, } buying another car just to tool around town in and make,  {D you know, } brief trips and things like  that,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D well, } I live in a suburb of Dallas --	24
<Laughter>  {D Actually, } it's Gin two.	24
{C but } we had a hell of a lot of fun doing it.	24
-- they never know when they want to run out and  do an errand at noon, {D you know, } they just feel they need their car.	24
Yeah,	15
{F Huh. }  It really is.	21
in fact, I want to, {F uh, } rent it when it comes out for my husband to see,	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
uh-huh. #	15
{D Well, } that's what my wife really wanted	24
{C so, }  it does get rather interesting trying to survive on one salary, {F uh, }	24
bye-bye.	38
{C but } that was back before -- -- air-conditioning was so [ p-, +  {D you know, } prevalent ] -- -- and all.	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C But } then she keeps repeating it, practice makes perfect,	24
Isn't that interesting?	12
{C but, }  I don't want to take the  chance	24
{C but, } {F uh, } at the same time, I think [ there are a lot of, +   there is a lot of ] good that the United States and other countries can do, as far as example	9
{C But } we do love to eat out,	24
yeah,	4
I just, {F uh, } don't think that I need them, {D you know. }	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } it is so good.	9
That's fun.	21
[ {C A-, } +  {C and } ] good luck,	38
Yeah.	15
{C but } it's the other way around.	24
Uh-huh,	36
{F Oh, } you agree with Schwartzkopf who says, {F uh, }  Drive on into Baghdad.	8
When you're young, [ you, + <noise> you ] can abuse  [ [ your, + your, ] + all your ] systems	9
{C And } I think, {F uh, } it's becoming,  {F uh, } more popular then it has been for a while, I think.	9
Right.	15
{C and } -- -- we turned everything we could,	24
Have you tried it yet?	7
Yeah,	15
Yeah,	36
We have one.	11
Huh.	15
[ I, + I  ] know of a couple of people at least who would be arguing with that.  Or arguing against that pretty vehemently.	24
that's, -	26
{F Oh, } that's fascinating.	21
They're cooperative rather than competitive,	9
{C And, } -	26
{C But, } {F um, } the effect that it's had on this young man's life is so dramatic that it's heartbreaking --	24
My mom's an L V N.	24
# {C and } # you knew this,	16
{C and } what you could expect, they said, {D you know, } a five percent over cost -- -- and then options at cost and everything.	24
{C but } -- -	26
Yeah.	36
{C but, } <sigh> {D well, } {F uh, } I, -	26
That's really awful,	21
fees [ that, + that ] fund these things, I guess that's trickled down to the states	9
<Breathing> <laughter>  And they'r-, -	26
<Laughter> Yeah.	15
sure.	15
some do horrible, {D you know, } until they get to {D like } tenth grade,	9
-- I just don't like the cold.	24
Yeah.	15
That's right.	36
You'd have to say that.	9
{C And then } they proved it,	24
{C and, } {F uh, } her mother stays home	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D You know, } # you don't # just add one plus one	13
{F Um, } it wasn't until late,  I guess in the summer,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D You know, } {C and } I, -	26
# {C And } [ they feel # -- + -- they feel ] pretty helpless.	9
{D Well, } that's great.	21
{C and, } course, we have a large garden here that we grow a lot of our own stuff	24
<Laughter>.	20
yeah.	26
# on some days, {F uh, } <laughter>  it's, {F uh, } I don't know -	24
How long would you be there?	39
I live in Mesquite --	24
I have two,	24
{C and, } {F uh, } everything is covered --	9
Okay,	13
People have commented how, {F uh, } they were surprised at how small they were.	24
{E I mean, } here it is,	26
Bye-bye.	38
the time that I've studied in Mexico, {F uh, } [ se-, + ] {A Spanish was one of my majors in college, } [ that, + ] {F uh, } there was a kind of a lot of resentment there towards America,	24
there was a high error rate in the analysis of drug results.	24
[ [  I, + I  like a, ] + I saw ] [ [ [ the, + {F uh, } the, ] + {F uh, } the, ] + the ] tapes [ that were, + that were ] run of Marion Berry's drug bust	24
(( I don't know if [ they've, + they did something about ] )) -	24
{C And, }  {F uh, } sometimes we'll go, {D you know, }	24
{C and } [ I, +  I ] just couldn't get over the fact that Reagan beat him.	24
It is the big events, not the little events.	24
Yeah.	15
{D Actually, } I'm real close to being in the market to buy a car.	24
# <Laughter>  ((   ))  I don't think [ we've, + # we've ]  missed a fish store on the entire [ east, + northeast  ] coast of the United States <laughter>.	24
Uh-huh.	15
<Laughter>.	20
Me, too.	24
{C and } I like [ the, +  the ] driver's air bag,	24
Okay.	15
{F Huh? }	14
instead of throwing out the window, [ they, + they ] keep the bottle	24
{C And } we would see him, {F uh, } several miles from our house,	24
{C so } I wasn't using them too much --	24
it, -	26
maybe they just need everybody to tell them they can't do it.	24
Yes.	15
uh-huh --	15
Okay,	13
{D Well, } now my daddy's mother, {F uh, }  lived in [ a, + a ] retirement village	24
[ [ that's, + that's ] + the telephone is ] not the only invasion of privacy.	9
[ We're, +  we're ] in Dallas.	24
Yeah,	36
{F Oh, } really?	12
-- {C and } you don't think about the pain of it.	24
Uh-huh.	36
{C And } you only get one of them?	7
{C But, }  {F uh, } I just think that, {D you know, } when there's two year olds running around, [ the, + [ whoever is taking care of, + the care givers ] ] are going to pay attention to the two year olds.	9
We're kind of out of, {F uh, } the natural tree area.	24
{F Oh, } I see.	15
{D Anyway, } {D well, } it's, {F uh, } nice talking to you.	38
{C And } they pay cash for everything they buy.	24
<Laughter>.	20
yeah,	26
{C And, } {F um, } it scares me a little bit to think that they would begin restricting gun control to the point where, {F um, } eventually we may not be able to have that right any more.	24
{D You know, } the high school games, {E I mean, } that seems to be the big attraction, and college.	9
{C and, } {F uh, } one of these days it's going to all be full.	24
Yeah.	15
{C And } they're also looking at, {F uh, } other, {D you know, } ways of monitoring this [ and, + ] cause they've found out something basically that, {F uh, } -	24
{C and } we've had it for a while,	24
Right,	36
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
uh-huh.	15
The reason that I ask is the two conversations  I've had, have been out of state.	24
We have, {F uh, } a news thing on the  computer [ that, + {F uh, } that ] [ I'll, + I'll ] try to look at every day.	24
[ what, + what ] is their location,	39
{E I mean, } there's no dental or vision.	24
# Find a place. #	2
We snow ski at Mount Bachelor mostly -- -- in Oregon,	24
{C But, } {F uh, } that seems rather unlikely at this point, unfortunately.	24
{D Well, } {D you know, } [ T I, + {D you know, } T I ] offers some good stuff	9
Wow,  that's large <laughter>.	21
that's true.	9
Yeah.	15
{C and } I put paper all over the floor.	24
{D Well, } there is a woman in our choir, who is nearly famous for her apple pies,	24
I don't know,	19
I -	26
((   ))  {D you know, } I don't want to pay more than I have to,	24
Yeah.	15
-- {D so. }	26
There are more things to work out.	9
{C but } maybe they are.	24
this is our side [ a-, + allow ] to have certain emissions up to a  certain tonnage.	24
in March.	24
You have a computer at home?	8
{C But } he can't say anything.	24
{C so. } # -	26
# Uh-huh. #	15
# {C but } # I've never seen either [ [ of the first, + {D you know, } of the, ] + of the ] GODFATHER movies	24
If you're not available on the hour or half hour, then you lose out on an awful lot.	9
I often, -	24
{D Well, } I think it's a good idea.	9
Yes,	15
[ If, + if ] they have complications and, -	9
<Laughter> Unless you, -	26
{C Because } [ our, + our ] medical coverage has gotten increasingly worse over, let's see, the past five years, to the point now where even if we need surgery, our insurance only covers eighty percent of it.	24
{D Well, } I think we've accomplished five minutes	9
uh-huh.	15
I'm so much for it.	24
{F Oh, } you have got, {F uh, } young children then.	8
That sounds fun.	21
I've never been on a cruise.	24
She works in these, {F um, } <lipsmack> Trump type casinos,	24
What about, {F oh, } -	26
{C but } they had a lot of, {F uh, } {F uh, }  counseling groups that use some of the episodes [ as, + # as ] examples # of things that were going on	24
U N L V,	30
{D Actually } I think we have talked  about football for five minutes.	24
[  I, + I, ] -	26
that's, -	26
Yeah,	4
we're into baseball,	24
As long as there was a bathroom there and some clean showers and  things like that, then it was fine.	24
I don't either.	24
{C So, } it's another thing.	24
{F uh, } [ it, + we ] might also be helped, though, because [ it, + it ] will be easier to do business over there, too.	9
-- {C so } that's close, {D you know, }	24
{F Uh, } I [ got to s-, + get to see ] a lot of crimes,	24
[ {C and } -- + -- {C and, } ]  {D well, } of course, another one of their mistakes, I think, is they have a tendency to change characters, or to change the characters', {F uh, } {F uh, } personalities -- -- {D well, } especially after they get married.	9
# At least, # on the jury.	22
She always lived here in the south,	24
{F Oh, } [ g-, + where have I gone ] that's anywhere.	16
{F Oh, } that's Wednesday at, {F uh, } seven thirty.	24
good luck in your car hunting.	38
I'm finding out now that what I'm needing the most now is not smarts, not what I can do on paper,  it's stamina, courage, {F uh, }  ((   )) , -	24
{C so. } -	26
the warranty on the refrigerator, {F uh, } -	24
{C and, }  {F uh, } one thing that is a big concern in the evening, at night, {F uh, } is, {F uh, } make sure that all the food's put away and so forth -- -- because, {F uh, } we have, {F uh, } armadillos.	24
that's similar to Georgia.	24
{F Uh, } oh.	15
{F Oh, } boy.	21
Eighty-three,	24
# {D Well, } like # they say, {D like } nobody can  get enough, {D you know. }	9
-- {C and, } {F uh, } I'm kind of semi retired.	24
Uh-huh,	15
-- wasn't that something of him.	16
# I think it will. #	9
Uh-huh.	15
{F uh, }	26
{C But } that's all right.	24
{F Uh, } I'm a native Texan.	24
Georgia.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Read the story and just found it so incredibly watered down	24
[ [ it's, + it's, ] + it's ] getting, -	9
[ I, + <laughter> I'm ] glad (( that )) she was able to pull out of it (( that way )) and so cheaply the second time.	24
My first one was the toughest,	24
if you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to some channel for it	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } I spend a lot of time	24
{C and } you frame them and stuff,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } for example, I used to like old Phil Collins.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Huh. }	15
Yeah.	15
It doesn't hurt, {F uh, } {D you know, }	9
Yeah,	15
{C And, }  {F um, } {D you know, }  every now and then the file gets so big, that, {D you know, }  it moves slower than I'd like --	24
Yes. Uh-huh.	15
<laughter>.	20
Yes.	15
<Talking>.	20
{C and } anybody who's contributed  toxic waste, no matter if you were somebody that eventually, {D you know, } {F uh, }  damaged the ground or not.	24
her only problem is trash.	24
That's right.	36
All right.	36
{D Well, } that's pretty much the same way here.	24
Yeah <noise>.	15
{F Oh, } uh-huh.	15
[ it's, + {F uh, } it's ] only {D like }  eleven hundred square feet.	24
they're pretty young.	22
I enjoy playing basketball [ and, +  and ] basically all kinds of sports.	24
I don't seem to get, {D you know, } as much variety these days lately -- -- as I used to.	24
{E I mean, } [ they get, + they got  ] everything tuned up right, {D you know. }	24
The brown haze that you see if you look down Central towards downtown -- -- a lot of that is, {F uh, } tied up with the oxides or nitrogen although some of the kind of bluish gray stuff we see sometimes is tied up with particulates.	24
it was a big thing going on there	24
{C and } I'm on my, -	24
-- {C so } all she's paying is interest on hers every month.	24
Where he defines [ dep-, + democracy  ] as everyone votes for the issues and republic is people who vote for someone who then in turn votes for the issues.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } [ she, + she ] got pregnant	24
Uh-huh.	15
# {C So } I # think that's good.	9
the season started about a week and a half ago	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I go to school during the day and work at night.	24
Bye.	38
{C and } I've been through Dallas, Texas.	24
It's always had it's own unique look.	9
{C and } whether, -	26
# {F Uh, } # what most annoys me are  all sorts of phone calls trying to sell me things.	24
# {C so } # [ it, + it ] got into the carpeting, got into the floor.	24
That's a long time.	9
{F Uh, } [ [ [ no, + no ] + not, ] + no, ]	33
now [ that's, + that's, ] -	26
<Laughter> That's good, you know,	9
{D Well } I could have,	11
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh,	15
{C and, }  {F um, } that's why, {E I mean, } I was so tickled  with my Honda	24
Right.	15
the children love them,	24
{C and }  this candidate tells # you # -- -- some things.	9
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
# Uh-huh. #	15
-- {C but } he's doing them within the bounds of what a normal person would do --	9
We used to live in  Oakland,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Very good.	21
Yeah.	15
I used to live in Georgia	24
{C But } they are still bars <laughter>.	9
When you're saying as far as the appeal, {F uh, } procedure was concerned.	24
<Noise> <swallowing> <<sounds like she is drinking something>> I do too,	36
{D well, } {F uh, } some of the books I've read lately have to do with crafty type things [ where I've, + where I've, ] {F um, } learned things that I'm going to do for my children for Christmas --	24
I had a Cocker Spaniel.	24
I played flute for, almost ten years	24
{C but } then, -	26
Is she of Alzheimer's or something like that?	35
Okay,	29
I didn't realize that.	24
{C And } that softens it up, huh.	22
Okay,	15
Yeah	36
uh-huh.	36
{C so } I see a lot of, {F uh, } verdicts that are <breathing> pretty crazily decided.  {F Um, } by juries particularly,	24
I even find now {D like } with the automatic tellers, I'll go take money out of that --	24
Yeah.	15
I let my wife take the checkbook,	24
{F Oh, } yeah,	36
{C And so } [ we, + we ] went quite often	24
great,	21
That's for sure,	21
{D Well } not only that,  needing the room, {D you know, } we finally ended up buying a Dodge Caravan here about two and a half years ago, because I too, have very small kids.	24
{C But, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } that's basically just about <breathing>, -	24
[ [ he, + he,  ] + he's  ] from Ireland isn't he?	7
Really,	15
{C and } there's just an awful brown haze all the time --	9
what happened was that [ some of [ the, + the ] wa-, + a lot of water ] settled on the top	24
The money's not available.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Um. }	15
Right.	15
when I was single and again when I'm retired, I will not mind paying, {F uh, }  what it takes to keep the schools good.	24
I think it's much nicer when you can really get out far enough away where, # that # you can't see people -- -- <Laughter> right out the window.	9
{D You know, } [ they, +  they ] stripped her of everything, practically besides [ the, +  the ]  clothes on her back.	24
They wouldn't.	24
{C and } it just seemed like it would be a fun place to go.	24
I get off on strange little  details of food, I guess.	24
Yeah,	15
{C but } in any event, {F uh, } I'm in favor of national health. If I had -- -- to vote for it.	24
# Oh. #	29
{C but } they didn't appear to belong to anyone.	24
the elderly are very, {D you know, } complaining because they remember the way that things used to be. And remember being able to do things for themselves which, {D you know, } they no longer can.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C and so } my don't change dramatically over the years.	24
Africa,	24
{C And } I don't think she's ever touched it -- -- {D you know. }	24
Okay,	38
-- there's all sorts of systems where suicide, {F uh, } predisposition. -	24
Huh-uh.	15
{F Uh, } in fact, one of the incidents I was thinking of that my son had.  {F Uh, } he was struggling with senior English	24
{D well, } they match four  percent which is the same, # {D You know, } fifty # percent or four percent. *[[listen; particularly nonsensical]]	24
{C and } we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it.	24
-- {C but } if it's a class of fifteen -- -- and you need help, you know that it's much  easier to do it and  especially in the large schools they have lectures --	25
{C but } really, {E I mean, } when you stop and think about it, Anthony Perkins didn't have that big a role in the movie --	9
{C and } he'd already been paid by a cashing firm.	24
no.	30
Does it taste a lot like shrimp	7
Just when I get some spare time here and there I'll work on it,	24
# {D So, } {D so } {D you know, } [ I, +   I ] would just # as soon, -	24
-- {C but } then after that, I was on my own, working and, {D you know, } trying to go to school on my own.	24
like half the members are really expert	24
{C But } getting the baby to day care, getting the kids off to school, I still did everything I always do,  {D you know, }	24
{D Well, } [ that, + that's ] a system too.	9
Yeah	15
The story of my life <breathing>.	24
[  I, + I ] can probably go on,	38
{C and } how you have to, {F uh, } be aggressive and, {D you know, } really want something for yourself and that type of stuff.	24
Uh-huh.	4
Uh-huh.	15
it would just come off in the rake, down to the dirt.	24
{D Well, } okay,	15
{C and } he just brought this Norwegian elkhound an, home	24
Yeah,	36
{C And } we've been down in Texas eighteen years,	24
use it as [ a, +  just a, ] -	26
{C and } that is it.	24
{C and, } # -	26
Uh-huh,	38
the U S policy, {F uh, } towards Central America as far as, {F uh, } -	26
[ Me, +  I ] figure if it's something really  important, somebody will tell me about it.	9
{C And } # I went # -- -- to college for four years and got out, {D you know, }	24
we don't have a big problem with it.	24
{C so } -- -- that's a pretty good deal.	9
They have one under my first name  and  [ initial + -- -- middle initial, ]	24
{D well } that's right.	36
{C but, } I've been trying all different times,	24
they, {F uh, } make the mistake of, #  (( pushing all their cards )) . #	9
{F uh, } {F oh, } shoot,	21
{C but } -- -- {F um, } <smack> <<sound made with mouth>>  I just enjoy reading about the resorts and where you can go [ and, + and ] new equipment that's come out and so forth.	24
Uh-huh,	15
I guess, {F uh, } [ when you, + when you ] count all the little things that people do like, -	9
{F Uh, } I have, {F uh, } been know to keep trucks or cars for {F oh, } ten or twelve years,	24
[ {C And, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } we have a very active nursing home here in Plano [ that, + that ] has, {F uh, }  activities going all the time	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well } {D see, } I guess it's  because you lived with, {D you know, } him [ {C an, } + {C and } ] overcame some fears to get used to him.	9
-- {C and, } {F uh, } [ that was a very, + {F uh, } [ that, + that  ] was   an awful ] three years afterwards.  {D You know, } of recovery -- -- and the difficulties and, {F uh, } everything we did	24
{C and } I know that my <breathing> future  husband will be {D You know } -	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } I'd say, -	24
{D Well, } we did too.	24
Very much so.	11
-- [ they, + they're ] caught dead to rights.	24
I buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail --	24
That's been a real big plus.	9
I don't, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
# {C And, } # -	26
{C and } you put it in there,	25
{F Um, } it's pretty fun.	24
We really only know of one, {F uh, } young man [ who, + {F uh, } who's ] a fam-, -	24
{C and } I know everyone  {D like } in the high schools in Dallas,	24
Yeah,	15
[  Is it, + is it, ] {F uh, } -	26
Have you, {F um, } found in talking to your neighbors that your utilities are quite a bit higher with those high ceilings?	7
{C so } do  you have any pets now?	7
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
{C and then, } {C so } if she ever does become ill, {F uh, } it will be like family around her.	24
{C and then } you get to their life story,	24
{C and } they have a total ban on guns	24
<noise> he does half	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Now, } {D see, } we don't have that here, yet.	24
Yes.	15
{C So, } [ that's + I think, that is ] good that they're like that.	9
She drives and everything,	24
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] she was telling me all her problems, {D you know, }	24
it's, -	26
[ he says, + he said, ] {F uh, } you're at thirty something,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Okay,	36
{C And } I keep the radio on quite a bit when I'm home.	24
yeah.	26
{talking to someone in background}, they're downstairs ((Aaron)), {resumes talking to A}	10
now [ I, +  somehow I ] feel we're living in an impartial society as far as people seeing something happen,  {D you know, } across the street, or seeing someone get mugged, or unfortunately, raped,	9
Yeah,	15
{C and } -- -- I even liked Jim Reeves -- -- {D you know } --	24
I do almost all my purchasing on credit cards.	24
[ That's, + that's  ] right	36
I would think so, too <noise>.	36
I don't, -	26
uh-huh.	15
I am also in the travel business,	24
Uh-huh.	15
# You lived in Africa? #	8
if I was looking at a U S map, I would say it [ was +  sort of reminds ] me  [ of, + of ] a, {F uh, } -	24
{F uh, } {C so } let's see.	17
{D well, } I'm sitting here on  the ninth floor of an office building on the north side of Dallas, Texas.	24
-- {C and } I thought {D well, } {D now } [ that's, + that's ] close enough to being several, {D you know, } -	9
you'll say to him, spell cat,	24
Yeah.	36
{F Oh, }  {C and } every year, of course, the phone books -- -- {F um, } they tell everybody across the city to,  {F uh, } put all their phone books in, {F uh, } the, {F uh, } recycle bins.	24
and he'll put you in touch with a certain guy, a certain person at that dealer's place.	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ I, + I ] worked four years one time,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{E I # mean } (( )) # -- -- burned out.	9
yeah,	38
[ {C but, }  + {F uh, } {C but } ]  then again, who, {D you know, } -	26
{D So } then I'm, {F uh, } {F uh, } probably a poor example, although, {D you know, } I was an administrator and could still be I suppose.	9
since my parents [ are, +  are, ]  {D well, } -	26
{C but } -- -- <Inhaling> I haven't really been taking it out, recreationally too much lately <laughter>.	24
I know when my friend's mother-in-law first went in, {E I mean, } very antisocial.	24
{F Oh, } wow.	21
what?	39
{C and } someday, maybe, we might even own it,	24
Ten dollars is for vacation fund whatever.	24
[ Why, + why ] you even telling me this?	39
{F Oh, } what's that about?	39
# Okay. #	36
I think people need to understand more {D like } what a meter is, instead of how many feet in a meter or something. Just get used to using all the terms.	9
I've been around for quite a few years and  worked for a lot of different companies,	24
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] I think about it more often because my husband's parents [ are, + they're ] very active right now,	24
{F Um, } {C and } I haven't even decided as far as, {F um, } what kind of paint to buy.	24
-- {C and } [ [ it's really, + {D you know, } it's, ] + it ] gets to be [ a r-, + a big ] problem.	9
Yeah.	15
right.	15
Yep.	15
{D Actually, } there was, {F um, } a small country or small city, I think, [ or even, + ] not actually in Saudi Arabia or anything, but a little bit off to the, {F um, } east of it, I think.	24
I love it.	24
{C and } yo-, -	26
that's true.	36
{C But } you could put them in  one of these cribs and then roll the crib out I guess.	22
{C and } there's a lot of crime there,  {F um, } migrant Hispanic farm workers, people that are down and out,	24
{F Um. }   (( Yeah ))	15
{C And, }  {F uh, } it seems like it's just [ a, + an ] added tack on.	9
It would be nice to know [ what's, + what was, ] -	24
[ I, + I'm ]  kind of biased, too, because I don't do drugs	24
{C So, } what's the temperature up today over there?	39
# Yeah. #  # {D Well. } #	15
[ It, + {F uh, } it ] probably was a lot warmer up high.	9
# {C But, }  # -	26
Right.	15
{D So, } I've enjoyed talking to you.	38
{F Oh, } it is delicious.	24
Yeah.	15
{C and then } he finally, {D you know, } moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have.	24
yeah.	15
{C and } [ the show, + did you see the show ] where she lost all of that fat?	7
Oh.	15
the winter hasn't been bad this winter.	24
{C so } [ I, + I've ] been away from there too long <laughter>.	24
{C so } we bought, {F um, } a Chevy Nova about three years ago.	24
Yeah.	15
{C And } they go to college, etcetera.	24
or go into [ the, + the ] more depressed areas and help repair the houses.	24
uh-huh.	36
{C But, } {F uh, } yeah,	26
That is we also have blue bins.	24
{C and, }  {F uh } # -- -- [ the, + {F uh, } the ] blade they sent me at first that went into the machine, it looked, {D you know, } perfectly okay	24
[ It, + it ]  would be nice if more communities could do that,	9
That's true.	36
((   ))  we are supposed to talk, -	24
{C and } he  went there to go to the bathroom.	24
<laughter>.	20
yeah. #	15
{C and, } {F uh, } [ we seem, + we seem ] to have, {F um, } -	24
-- {C but, } {F uh, } it's quite time consuming, by the way.	24
Uh-huh.	15
# {C And } I think, {D you know, }  that's an excellent idea.	36
<Laughter>.	20
I'm not.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	4
I just shoot around by myself.	24
{C but } they only [ w-, + {D you know, }   would ] cover [ fif-, +  forty-nine ] percent of the decision or fifty percent	9
{C But } I guess to get back to the main topic, I don't know whether I pay too much taxes.	24
{D Well, } {F uh, } it's kind of early f-, -	26
# yeah.  #	15
{D So } it's <laughter>, -	26
I know what you mean.	21
What's that?	39
{C and } my husband's working	24
{D you know, } {C and } it's the same way with, -	24
Gives you sympathy for the vigilantes.	9
{C and } most of them joined the Red  Cross	24
I usually only go about a mile or two.	24
-- {C and } I think it's such a valuable thing for our elderly.	9
[ We just, + my wife and I just ] recently moved into our house.	24
{F Uh, } number one is [ [ I, + I'm, ] + I'm ] kind of, -	24
Also, {D you know, } a couple of years ago, [ ten, [ fif-, + fifteen, ] + ten, fifteen ] years ago, an individual going into a career could expect to have that career basically throughout their whole life,	9
<laughter>.	20
[ there's + ] not too many basements in Texas.	24
{E I mean, } why should we push English,	16
Yeah,	36
[ [ [ I, + I, ] + {F uh, } I, ] + I ] really liked it.	24
{F Oh, } okay <laughter>.	29
Mine is Gin.	24
We, -	26
[ they have, + they have ]  convertibles now in the Cadillac, field	24
{C and } that is true for Ellison.	24
No.	33
Gosh.	21
[ What kind of, + what kind of ] work do you do?	39
# Pants, shoes.	24
{C and } she had this fantastic, {F um, } family effort [  in, + in  ] recycling,	24
[ {C but, } + {C but } ] supposedly once you have an office in D C, [ or, + ] {D you know, } [ and, + and ] staff it with people, it's really tough to close it down	9
{D Well, } they're not c-, -	26
{C and } they recycle the fuel	24
[ I, +  I ] guess [ today # -- + -- today's ] my first day that I # could # -- -- even do it.	24
{C So, } -	26
[ It <laughter> was true, + it was truly awful. ]	9
Uh-huh.	15
no,	33
{C So, } [ g-, + ] having your, -	26
I don't, -	26
Maybe  they're going to arrest us both.	24
Uh-huh.	15
# Right. #	36
Uh-huh.	15
I haven't ever called.	24
It is.	36
{C and, } {F uh, } the other thing that I always notice is that whenever they write about something that I'm an expert in, I find their descriptions to be wrong --	24
[ I, + I, ] -	26
{C and } one's about to be in high school.	24
Uh-huh.	15
my brother's a trim carpenter,	24
[ your, + your, ] -	26
You know what, [ we read, + we read ] the, {F uh, } D MAGAZINE --	24
Are you aware at all, [ of, + of ] [ what they would, + what they cost? ]	7
And, uh, uh, so I called back the guy in Dallas	24
{C But } I don't know.	34
{C but } it was [ out, + {D you know, } out  ] at the State Fair Music Hall	24
yeah.	26
{C and } the State still can't bring itself [ to, + to ] [ ex-, + execute, ] this guy.	24
Mostly it's been at lunch time --	24
{F Uh, } [ I d-, + I just don't ] seem to have time to sit down and read the paper.	24
{D Well, } not really.	3
if it had, the seat belts on the door now -- -- I wouldn't get it.	24
# I guess it's a combination. #	9
# {F Um. }  #	15
Yeah,	4
-- {F oh, } sure,	21
Don't you.	26
# [ {C and } were officially, + # yeah,	24
Uh-huh.	15
-- {C but. }  {D Well, } [ I don't, + I don't ] know.	19
we live in north of Dallas.	24
It was something like that <laughter>.	19
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] I think it's moved in the right direction.	9
{D You know, } it's funny,	9
{C but, } {F um, } I don't know,	19
Just hang up.	38
I've, {F uh, } -	26
{F Oh, } okay.	29
One was {D like, } environmental protection	24
[ It, + it ] didn't help me that much <laughter>.	24
{D Well, } [ if you don't, +  with some of the movies, if you don't ] go to them within the first four weeks, the movie may have, {F uh, } left town, never to show up again until it comes back in video.	9
{D Well, } [ that's, + that's ] a really good idea, because, {F um, } {D like } our, {F uh, } fruit juices for some reason when they're in a can don't come with a deposit.	24
# That's # right.	36
What do you think?	31
{C so } -- -- I don't have to, -	26
# It was nice. #	38
that's true.	36
{D Well, } I shouldn't say they are not going to be a good parent.	19
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh,	15
okay.	29
{C and } [ it was, + [ it w-, + ] it was ] a drama.	24
I said, now you better get out of the habit of watching those.	24
-- [ [ the, + the ] social, + the other social ] problems [ wouldn't, + wouldn't ] go away.	9
they're both different people, too.	24
{C so } they can sit down -- -- and all that good kind of stuff.	24
{D Well, } so you don't kill people on the road.	24
righ-, -	15
{C But } [ I, + I ] do think it needs to be shaken up a little bit.	9
{C Because } people have to vote in different  areas	9
[ It's, + it's ] kind of a strange topic [ [ to, + to try to, ] + for two people who don't really have a budget to ] talk about budgeting  and how they manage their money.	9
That's, -	26
Right,	36
I'm not a real car fan.	24
Yeah,	15
{F Uh, } did you like it?	7
Yeah,	36
--  it's a, -	26
Okay.	38
((   )) .   *[[slash error]] Barney Fife, I guess.   *[[slash error should be 'bf']]	13
Uh-huh.	15
There's a German word for it that's elegant,	24
<<Asks someone in the background>> What's the name of that restaurant?	10
{C so. } -	26
Yeah,	36
We don't have really a Spring or a Fall --	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
{D Well } is that a good indicator?	7
{D Hey } look bucko,	25
{C but, } -	26
<Throat_clearing>.	20
{C so. } -	26
{D Well, } [ [ isn't that a, + that's a, ] +  that's ] pretty, {F uh, } upscale, {F uh, } trash, {F uh, } {F uh, } situation.	9
Do you consider her country?	7
uh-huh.	4
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } you almost assume if you're going to have problems with it,  it's usually [ bef-,  + before ] that warranty would expire	9
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
{C and } I could take all my stuff home, because I didn't have a bed or a couch or  [ any, + any ] of that,	24
[ I don't, + I don't particularly, ] -	26
Yeah,	15
that's [ one of, + the one ]  great  thing about it <laughter>.	9
{C and } I went out in the back yard to get Brian	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } I guess we have reunions about once a year or so.	24
Oh.	15
{F Oh, } you're, -	26
{C But, } [ it's, +  {F uh, } {D you know, }  I guess, it, ] {F uh, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C But } let me ask you this, since you  (( use ))  Texans,	37
{C And so, } when Iraq, {D you know, }  saw this, they said let's take over the country, which is a good idea,	24
{F Uh, } it's the toughest job in the world to do.	9
Anyway, it's a tough question.	9
Well, it's been nice chatting with you.	38
{C and } I liked it better <noise>	24
{D like } whenever we go on trips, we always, {D you know, } use [ our, + our ] Visa or our Mastercard or whatever.	24
{C And } sometimes movies are here that [ I did not, + I  ] am not even aware that I could have seen, {D you know. }	24
Okay,	15
Yeah.	15
<Laughter> {D Well, } [ I, + I ] just last Friday got off a capital murder case.	24
all they have, -	26
{C and, } {F uh, } she stayed there for one day	24
{C And so } I'd like to do that.	24
We love fresh vegetables in the summer,	24
Uh-huh.	15
that's fun.	9
I don't have one at home,	24
I have friends that live in the other, the less fortunate or whatever you want to call it part of town	24
the [ hou-, + {D you know, } housing ] there is extremely affordable,  [ and, + ] {F uh, } compared to other parts of the country, {D you know, }	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but, } {D you know, } I'm sure you're familiar with that living, # here.  #	9
Or are they, -	26
# {F Oh, } okay. #	15
and she'd been, -	24
Uh-huh.	15
Do you think the jury should have a dollar figure for losing an arm, a dollar figure for losing different body parts?	7
Yeah,	4
{C and } did you see, -	25
Yeah.	15
{F Oh } I thought you, -	24
I, -	26
Killing lots of fire ants.	24
You, -	26
{C So } then we were not only paying  those bills regular like we were before,  but also adding the lower payment for all  of them, <laughter>.	24
{C but } now it's like, {F uh, } {D well } if he doesn't come home, can we get another dog <laughter>.	24
<Laughter>.	20
the only thing I've had problems with is,  {F um, } -	24
{C and } the guitar is set {D like, }  really low,	24
{F uh, } {D well, } [ I ha-, + I had ] an eighty-eight  that I really liked	24
You didn't have to mix paint then, right.	7
{F Um, } {C and } {D now, } [ I, + I ] did like  THIRTY SOMETHING --	24
Bye-bye.	38
I guess that's my call.	24
{C because } they'd go in and they'd win something.	9
Yeah,	4
[  The, + the ] last book I picked up was a book by Judy Bloom,	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
{C and } that was so much fun.	24
# Do # -- -- you think that the individual has as much time as they did,  let's say, ten, twenty years ago?	7
doesn't look good.	9
Yeah.	15
The other thing that we've done, [ that, + that ]  was really nice to see, we had one of the financial companies, {F um, }	24
Yeah.	15
Right.	15
Uh, go ahead.	18
Seems like it wasn't anything but bad news <laughter>.	9
It's, -	26
Even with the very tailored look of a suit, sometimes I like to have [ someth-, +  [ a lit-, + just a little ] something ] that's feminine.	24
Hang on just a second.	18
Yeah,	36
{C but, }  {F oh, } gosh, I can't even walk by Central Park  (( {D yeah } ))  when summertime,	24
Okay.	29
Yeah,	36
# Rome, New York, #	2
[ They brought, +  {F uh, }  the week after Christmas  they left ] a plastic bag on everybody's front doorknob with a little note on it saying, we're trying something new next week only, if you have any, {F uh, }  of those little, {F uh, } Styrofoam peanuts that, any of your Christmas presents were packed in,  put them in this bag and  leave it out with your recycling	24
Right.	15
{C and then } she was delivered the next day.	24
{F Uh, } {C so } budget is not a problem for us.	24
Yeah,	15
{C and <breathing> then } [ you, + you're ] either challenged which is, -	24
[ The other, + the other ] group that we had was kind of interesting.	24
{D Well, } the, {D you know, } -	26
{D so } [ how'd you all, + how do you, ] -	26
all my relatives my m-, -	24
{F Um, } I've never noticed that.	34
{C and } [ I'm, + I'm ] beginning to get a little bored with cross stitch.	24
{C And } I would get  another one in a minute.	24
Right.	15
{C And, } {F uh, } everything, -	26
{C but } in the Summer, like right now, my mom, {D well, } {D like } she doesn't let us watch T V until like eight o'clock at night, {D you know, }	24
#  (( No )) . #	15
# Yeah,	15
{D Well, } where do you think we ought to go with it?	31
{C But, } we do get together for [ wh-, + fellowships ] at our church,	24
I would be tempted to do it again.	24
I substitute a lot.	24
{E I mean } it's a very good movie	24
<laughter>.	20
Good luck to you.	38
I hope you get into camping some day, just slowly.	24
Right.	15
{C And } it is, -	36
There are shows [ th-, + that ] I like.	24
I know the hospital that I work in is a big hospital	24
Right.	15
{F Uh, } {D actually } I'm a Red Sox fan more than anything.	34
{C but } mostly, {F uh, } just -- -- do more, -	24
I really miss them. # {D You know. } #	24
I have a brother-in-law that lives  in Minnesota	24
Yeah,	15
{C and } it's fun, too, I think.	9
# <Laughter> #  # You just go hunting? #	16
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
{E I mean } I thought for sure I'd been raised properly	24
[ {C but } -- + -- {C but } ] [ that is, + that's ] a tough deal,	9
Because you'd probably be, {F uh, } too puritanical	22
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
You can't really get away.	8
Uh-huh.	15
[ those, + those ] are, -	26
what can we do?	16
"{C and } she said, ""You can't do that."""	24
Yeah,	15
Yeah,	36
Right.	36
Yeah.	15
That's about, that as far as any other everyday occurrences,	26
I, {F uh, } -	26
{C and } another day I'll come in	24
{C And } my husband had a lot of heartburn with that.	24
{F Oh, } yes.	21
{C So, } I don't know.	19
Yeah,	15
# Yes,	15
this Dodge Aries is the first car we've ever gotten that had anything.	24
{C But } I don't think the vines.	24
No,	36
We # had three, # in college, plus my wife,	24
Yeah.	15
Yes.	4
That is awful high.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } thank you.	42
[ You have to, + you have to ] do it correctly, {D you know, }	24
{C And, } also, [ we, + we ] dine at home a lot.	24
{C And } I thought it was a good sacrifice to make, because, {F um, } it was important to me [ to, + to ] spend some time with kids.	24
{C and } I went skiing	24
{E I mean, } the kids sit there	9
Right.	15
{D You know, } I think it's kind of coming back around to that, don't you,	9
P-, -	26
are there cases where you think [ that, + that, ] {F uh, } [ the capital, + the capital ] punishment shouldn't be, {F uh, } {F uh, } sentenced?	7
{C and } we bought a house.	24
right.	15
I don't even know if there's any other shows that I watch  or else.	24
It's really weird.	9
<Talking> Yeah.	15
{C and } they're all spiritually, {F uh, } oriented,	24
{E I mean } I, -	26
there's no bugs.	24
It's in their culture.	9
{C so } maybe I'll figure it out.	24
{C and } you're driving back home	9
It can only hurt the deficit picture.	9
He said, {F uh, } there's no way I'm getting in that machine.	24
Yes.	36
It used to be in Georgetown, years ago.	24
{E I mean } it just just looked like they, got a bunch of retirees and put them in leather jackets and blue jeans.	9
{C but, } for some reason a mini skirt is, to me a little more unprofessional to wear to work than jeans	9
{C and } they have a driving range and weight room	24
{C And } nobody had any idea what a liter was,	24
{C So, } -	26
{C And so } the Sherman deal [ is, + ] {F um, } {F uh, } <laughter>  lost a lot of hair over that project.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } really.	12
Do you still keep up with them,  or someth-,	7
I've always wondered how he gets around.	28
{D actually } I haven't.	24
[ {C but, } + {C And, } ] {F uh, } the dealership I dealt with, they order them all with the, {F uh, } moon roof and, {F uh } -- -- {D you know, } nice floor mats and everything in there.	24
Nothing.	30
[ [ they're just, + [ they're,  + they're ] just, ] +  {F uh, } they're ] wonderful, {F uh. }	9
{F Oh } is it ten minutes.	7
{C and } {F uh, } it depends, because I don't like to sell what we're trading in to an individual -- -- {F uh, } unless [ we, + we ] have done that when we had a really good one that we wanted to sell --	24
let's see,	17
{D Well, } [ the, + {F uh, } the ] Lexus, {F uh, } really, -	26
Bye-bye.	38
[ A lot of, +  a lot of ]  American servicemen are involved,	24
yes.	4
sometimes I think a religion has a lot to do with that.	9
Yeah,	4
{C and then } every now and then [ they'd DAYS, + they taped DAYS, ] {D you know, } # and # watch it like four or five times a day.	24
I don't know.	19
Um.	15
Sure.	36
that sounds like something  a little kid would do. {D You know. }	9
<Laughter> I just have a hard time  finding any spare time lately.	24
{C but } we use to take all of the kids tobogganing and ice skating, and all of that kind of stuff --	24
A little boy that had died of leukemia, I think,	24
{C because } that's all there is to it.	24
Yeah.	15
Like my husband is not  musical at all,	24
Kids in high school are just too young to be married.	9
# {F Uh, } # [ the, + one ] of my friend's parents who went in because she had largely lost her abilities -	24
I've still got babies.	24
They've been living there for about  three months now,	24
{C And } nowadays [ [ you, + you'll ] get, + you'll get ] a dog trainer to recommend a specific, {D you know, } breeder handler.	24
Uh-huh.	36
Right.	11
Yeah.	15
{C but } [ it is, + it does ] seem to be a big problem, {D you know.  }	9
# Uh-huh. #	15
<Doorbell> <breathing>.	20
[ Her, + her ] parents live by the public transportation.	24
Uh-huh,	29
I think I watched something last week, {F uh, } (( )) , {E I am sorry, } the  accused has the right to a speedy trial.	24
<Noise>.	20
# There will # be a lot of people who will not get even a menial education like in other countries of the world -- -- where they don't try to educate everyone.	9
<Throat_clearing>  Really,	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C So, } going out on a boat, never did  appeal to me simply because [ it, +  {D you know, } there was ] so much else to do.	24
it's still going to be a number one hit.	25
{F Uh, } I haven't really seen one since probably August because, {F uh, } every weekend [ in, + in ] the Fall we go to our high school football game on Friday -- -- then we go out with friends after,	24
{C and so }  the time we were {D like } visiting our father in the summer  time, {D you know, }	24
{C and then } we went up to Dallas	24
[ Rather, + rather ] odd personality,	24
You had to come home and # clean before you could # -- -- even do anything probably.	22
If you like doing  everything twice <breathing>.	9
Uh-huh.	15
What, -	26
{C or } -	26
<Laughter>  We had one of those two days ago. [ {C But } not, +  {F uh, } {C but, } {F uh, } no ]  rain at all yesterday and, {F uh, } no rain today.	24
{C but } a lot of schools had a lot of transient, {F uh, } families and a lot of families who were on the  poorer side	24
{C And } we did not know in August to put down the, {F uh, } whatever it is for grub worms.	24
{F Um. }	15
[ I, + I ] always that [ the, + the ] real question [ was + is, ] are we getting a reasonable return [ on, + on ] investment.	9
{D well, } -	26
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C but } ] I think when we were back at your age, we didn't have much of a budget --	9
{C So } [ I, + I ] really don't think [ it, + they ] can really do much of anything to change it.	9
{C and } I've always enjoyed dance.	24
they voted them in	24
that's pretty good.	21
{C So, } yeah,	36
{C and } most companies don't have, -	24
{C but } that one's an easy one.	24
What did she do with, -	26
[ I, + I ] don't know maybe other people, -	24
Uh-huh.	15
it was boneless --	24
{C but } that takes time,	9
keep going.	18
That's another story.	24
{C And so } the bas-, -	26
She likes to go out and stay in the woods.	24
I've seen some nice, nice sailboats.	24
{C But } I have such a big army outside of my place, that nobody can touch me.	9
he really should have hired people.	24
{F Oh, } yes, {F uh, }	36
Right,	15
and, since then I had ...	24
{F Uh, } what else.	17
Uh-huh.	15
She sent him to kindergarten.	24
{D See, } yeah,	26
We keep hearing well, we're going to receive, {F uh, } eight billion  dollars from Japan for [ [ [ the, +  {F uh, } uh-huh,  the, ] +  the, ] +  the ] big, war over there in the Mideast.	9
Do you read, -	7
-- it's supposed to be a huge problem  with truck drivers using drugs -- -- and alcohol,	24
I haven't bought it now for about eight years.	24
I don't have to wait until somebody calls me even though I have a feeling what's going to happen is I'll probably get tons of calls, {D you know, }  [ so, + ] sooner or later.	24
I know.	36
Exactly.	36
{C and } we, {F uh, } enter those [ into, + {F uh, } into ] a spread sheet <smack>	24
Um.	15
right,	15
Have you?	12
[ That's, + that's ] on our list of things to see <laughter>.	24
[ It, + it's ] good [ as, + ] [ in terms of, + in terms [ of, + {F uh, } of ] ] a contest.	9
Yeah.	15
# Oh. #	15
Yes.	36
I'm not,	24
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } that's good though, {D you know. }	9
Yeah,	36
{C But } right now I'm out in Provo, Utah going to B Y U	24
[ [ [ If, +  if, ] +  if, ] +  if, ] -	26
I'm reimbursed on insurance anyway,	24
<Laughter>.	20
{F Uh, } we do let them watch NINE ONE ONE,	24
That's right.	21
<Dishes>.	20
{D Well, } they need a schedule I think.	9
{D Like } one night	24
{C So } they were kind of insured with that hundred thousand dollars	24
Then she lived in an apartment	24
{C and } also, {D you know, } [ you, + you ]  feel more like, {D you know, } you're actually part of the community if you've done something, in it.	9
# {C and } # I think it's because they've gone since they were real little,	9
[ I, + I ] guess it's the stuff that comes out of automobile exhaust, {D you know, }	9
{C but } I wish it were	24
At that stage of life you only have so much money left	9
{D See, } we don't want anybody around here that says make me do it.	9
{D So } where do you live?	39
-- {C and } she has that up in her attic	24
settle down, -	26
{F Um. }	15
{C but } look at GONE WITH THE WIND, {D you know. }	18
Yeah.	15
yes,	4
what the heck was his name,	1
{C but } I'm not <laughter> going to one of those places.	25
{C but, } the little, thing etched  in it,	24
Yeah,	15
Oh.	15
#  [ I, + I ] us-, -	26
it's kind of depressing sometimes, I think.	9
{C but, } [  he, + he's ] too streaky it seems.	24
{C and } he signed it.	24
Uh-huh.	4
Uh-huh.	15
-- {C and } country seems to be the in thing out here -- -- {D you know, }	24
your imagination -- -	26
<Laughter>.	20
[ {C So, } + {C and so, } ] {D you know, } -	26
{F Uh, } the only thing you  have to do is cook the rice that goes [ in, + in ] it	24
no,	36
[ that's, + that's ] true too.	36
Glad to see y'all taken care of.	13
{C and } she said, yeah,	24
yeah.	15
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C so } ] since October then, they have been going there	24
{F Huh. }  {D Well, } there's a noticeable difference there.   *[[two utts?]]	9
I read that half where she was in her later years,	24
# Yeah,	36
I have, {F uh, } a stationary bike and, {F uh, }  a regular bike.	24
If they really wanted to vote Republican, they could go in the primary and say they were  voting Democrat and  then stack the ballot for someone that perhaps the Republican could beat.	9
{C and so } rather than just have one, we went ahead and got two.	24
Yeah,	15
Yes.	4
I got a degree from T W U,	24
it's not going to be so humid,	25
Yeah,	36
That's true,	36
{C and } {D now }  the young boy wants to know	24
[ that + that's ] a tough situation,	9
{C but } he plays wonderfully.	24
{C and then } you see them magnified in the children.	8
Okay.	29
{D Well, } it's real pretty,	9
<Laughter>.	20
They actually had to [ g-, +   take ]  a driving test on the tractor,	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	36
# Yeah. #	15
<Clicking> {D Well, } {F uh, } preferred benefits, {F uh, }	13
{C And } we, -	26
{F Oh, } that's wonderful.	21
He probably has an income of thirty-five thousand,	24
N C State.	24
just change our priorities -- -- a little bit.	22
{C and } it's our money that's cleaning this, # stuff up.  #	24
# {F Um. }  #	26
{C And, } I know my kids, {F um, } {D like } if they see litter on the ground they pick it up and say, {F Oh, } look at that. Somebody is not saving the earth, <laughter>  {D you know. }	24
No,	33
we would be ahead, {D you know, }	24
Right.	36
# {D Well, } # -	26
{D So, } -	26
I think it would be fairer	9
Uh-huh.	15
-- it causes the, {F uh, } <lipsmack>  {F uh } <noise>, # Saint Anthony's Fire Disease, where, # people fell into fits <noise>	24
{C so } we -- -- often buy it --	24
{C So } you're going to watch a game tonight?	7
It is delicious.	9
[ it doesn't, + it doesn't ] give you relaxation,	9
{C but } I wish I was more the other way.	24
{D Well, } you know, that, animals  are like that.	9
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
it doesn't.	24
You just rinse it off after the winter is over and -- -- done with it.	24
-- {C and } I know she's eating the right things,	24
Yeah.	15
{E I mean, } yeah.	30
{C So, } {D you know, } it was prime time,	24
Yeah,	15
Cool,	21
that, -	26
Oh.	15
{C And, } {F uh, } I keep those levels up above a certain minimum,	24
{D well, } that's the yankee way.	24
Such as?	7
{C and, } {D you know, } they don't  count that really,	24
<hum> Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
Plus I get in [ a lot, + an awful lot ] of good use of one at [ work, + where I work. ]	24
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah,	15
With every passing day we wonder if we will be.	24
It's pretty hot here during the Summer <laughter> -- -- gosh.	24
[ that, + that ] huge -	26
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
{C but } when I think of Texas, I think of nothing but, no trees and just grass <laughter>.	9
Not a good, not a good easy way to get in.	9
that is nice, {D you know, } to have that,	24
I don't typically feel intruded [ on, + on ]  the things, {F uh, } the sense of finding out information.	24
{C and } I guess [ it's, + it's  ] really disappearing a lot quicker than people realize	9
{C And } they had [ a, + a ] supervisory, {F um, } -	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ [ {C and, + } {F uh, } {C but } he, ] + {C but, } {D you know, } he ] likes to pick the grass up, too.	24
Let me turn off my stereo here <music>.	37
<Sniffing>.	20
{C and } those are really nice too.	24
He is bouncing around,	24
{C And } I mashed it wrong,  or I did something.	24
not us, -	26
-- {C and, }  {F uh, } I took sailing lessons when I was about six	24
cause with two we have a problem,	24
{C And } I know that's hard sometimes	24
{C And } one of the things we try to do is we try to avoid doing that as much as possible. Although it really is very easy to  do that type of thing.  Just plop them down in front of the T V and  let them be, {F uh, } entertained that way.	24
{C and so, } {F uh, } {D you know, } [ their, + their ]  success rate is very high.	9
{C but, } {F uh } it's real nice for carrying around our kids and others	9
The one in Florida is so cool because they pick up everything.	24
{C And } I'm, -	26
they get it at school and come home,	9
For instance, # one # thing that I did that might even be a  good suggestion for you -- -- {F uh, } was something I did on the outside.	24
I thought that was pretty n-, -	26
I cannot carry a tune in a basket.	24
Right,	15
{C And } it's real good.	24
No,	36
{C so, } -	26
{F Uh, } <throat_clearing> {C because, } we used to have two newspapers up until, {F uh, } last Sunday	24
In term of, {F uh, } -	24
They call it senior citizen day care.	24
{C but } it just seemed like, {D you know. } -	9
{C and }  [ [ I, + {D you know, } I ] don't wa-, + I don't like ] to give any at all --	24
{F Huh. }	15
-- yeah,	15
Sure it does.	36
{C and } we knew time wise, [ or, +  and ] money wise, too --	24
-- he went through surgery after surgery --	24
# <Laughter>. #	20
Did you go to Mexico City, {F uh, }  anywhere near when the earthquake hit.	7
Yeah.	15
Right.	15
They're certainly legal,	24
{C And } twenty years ago I was, {F uh, }  in graduate school pecking out a dissertation on a manual typewriter <laughter>.	24
{C And } he, -	26
Right <laughter>.	15
{F Um, } {D well } <static> {F um, } [ I'm a, + I'm a ]  [ counselor, + a therapist ] by trade,	17
[ [ {C and, } +  {C and } ]  you,  + {C so } you ] understand smog <laughter>.	8
{D So, } [ I don't, + I don't ] even know who your  favorite team is, {D actually. }	28
[ Do you work, + do you work ] for Texas Instruments then?	7
[ their, + the ] Mexican kids get a good education along the way,	24
Yep.	36
No,	33
{C and } she travels	24
{C so } I understand what you are saying there --	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ I, + I, ] -	26
{F Uh, } the kids couldn't handle him	24
{D You know, } I'm not really that big on watching what I eat,	24
{D You know, } {C and } these guys, they come to work  every morning	24
{C and } he had a very sophisticated taste.	24
No --	36
{F Oh } really?	12
Right <noise>.#	15
Okay.	29
Uh-huh.	15
I really don't see that that's a [ very, + very ] valid, {F uh, } thing for a company to say,	9
you're just saying it's common.	22
{C and, }  {F uh, }  [ I'm an a, + I'm an ] environmental engineer,	24
Okay.	13
I have forgotten what the question was exactly.	24
in high school.	30
{F Huh. }  See I got mine in, -	24
[  I'm, + I'm ] a -- -- news reporter.	24
{C so, }  it isn't, not at all, -	26
The cans [ do, + ] are worth something.	24
I'm so anti drunk driving,	24
I am, {F uh, } {D like } a Catholic	24
let's start up a Target.	24
{C So, } I know that's my personal viewpoint of things.	24
<Cough>.	20
Yeah.	15
{C or } is it? -	35
right  here, Bambi <laughter>.	30
# {C But, } I # have a problem.	24
[ I like, + {F um, } I have ] a lot of plants in my apartment,	24
Yeah,	36
{C and } I'll do the same.	38
A good well, though, I think is very healthy ...	9
<child_talking> It's, {F um, } -	26
<Laughter>.	20
It used to be [ you could go, + if you had a company you had to go ] through certain people	9
One thing is they don't have mosquitoes	24
{C and } [ we, + we ] took him in	24
{C and, } I used to put all the stuff in my basement,	24
Right.	36
{C And then } I saw recycling on tires between, {F uh, } -	24
we've had a real nice mild Spring.	24
A-, -	26
Yeah.	15
-- {C but } I know the Green card was like thirty-five, forty- five dollars a year.	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
uh-huh.	15
I have one of them.  {F Um, }	24
that's something do to, [ you + ] {D like } to get up in mountains    *[[two utts]]	7
{F Uh, } I made scallops the other night,	24
{C But } the Explorer, {E I mean, }  you're sitting up on top of everything	24
some of them were even better behaved.	24
Uh-huh.	15
because we're talking about boy friends	24
I don't know.	19
It's fairly easy and fast.	24
No,	32
{C or } they,   I agree with the freedom of the press, {D you know, }   and all the amendments,	24
{C and } now I have two little kids,	24
[ They were glass, + they were the glass, ] {F uh, } -	11
Right.	36
Yeah.	15
That's funny.	21
-- good deal.	21
[ We, + we ] have, {F uh, } over here in Plano, a little recreation center that has got, {F uh, } a walking track,	24
# that's # been, -	26
{C And } the young people are overly impressed.	9
{C but } just like the computers.	9
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } often juries hear only a fraction [ of the, + of the ]  story when they have to decide guilt or innocence.	24
now we're in the southwestern part of, {F uh, } Ohio, # just # forty miles north,  due north of Cincinnati,	24
If you're going to go ahead and pay your bills on time and things like  that.	24
{C and } he completely, {D you know, } goes the other way.	24
It's amazing [ how, + {F uh, } how ] much, {F uh, } it changes,	24
[ a, + a ] little bit of background study has never made an expert in any field.	9
{E I mean, } just -- -- they, {D you know, } -	26
It's also got a full [ insid-, + inside ] basketball court,	24
uh-huh.	15
{C So } [ I, + I ] know the people at T I who are doing this	24
They both grew up on a farm,	24
That's okay.	15
{D So, }  {F uh, } have you seen any concerts lately?	7
{C but, } -	26
Yeah.	15
<Laughter> I thought that was really funny.	24
You don't like the cold.	30
{F Uh, } we've been lucky.	9
{C and } when they came back,  they'd have to serve [ this, +  this ] year,	24
{C but } now I just in the last couple of years.  I have gotten to the point where I am saying I just cannot afford to pay anymore, # to # help people out.	24
I agree <laughter>.	36
{C So, } there's a lot of, {D you know, } activities, a lot of pluses and common land.  <sigh>	24
{F Uh, } for instance, {F uh, } {D well, } {D you know, }  I am just not taken as seriously, {D you know, } at professions, [ as many of the wom-, + as many of the men ]  who are doing the same job I do.	24
they meet with all of the parents,	24
{C And } I think that is my biggest objection to anything as far as invading my privacy. If somebody wants personal information out of me,	24
not as early as it came. -	24
{F Uh, } {C and } in Texas [ there is, + there is ] a couple of questions you have to ask, {F uh, } in the punishment phase.	24
{C but, } -	26
<Noise>.	20
yeah.	15
It's easy,	22
{C and, } {D you know, } they mark it all down	24
I do too # <laughter>. #	36
{C But } my grandmother, {F uh, } later on got cancer and, {F uh, } could no longer, -	24
{D Well, } I enjoyed it.	38
Exactly <laughter>.	36
I like being able to go back into the mountains, or, {D you know, } where the trail didn't necessarily lead, and where you couldn't necessarily, pitch a tent <laughter>.	24
<Laughter>.	20
# Right.  #	15
Nothing.	24
I quit watching GENERAL HOSPITAL when Leslie got killed.	24
# I, # -	26
The Restaurant Hall of Fame inducted him tonight,	24
It really is.	24
-- {C and } the trees are changing color there.	24
Yeah,	36
{C And } those that aren't participating, they have the specific drop off sites where you can take glass and newspaper and aluminum.	24
Just to read them.	2
{D you know, } he  ((   )) . -	26
You can come and go as you please type thing.	24
Yeah,	15
[ I just, + I ] enjoy   working with them.	24
{C or } do you, {F uh, } have a lot of people come in and have to prepare for them?	35
I see.	21
Every, what?	14
# {D Well } # -- -- [ I, + I ] try and read to them	24
I like to think that I'm a very good cook.	24
Right,	36
yeah.	15
is [ she, + she ] happy at school	7
# {F um, } # one of fifty thousand, I was one of three thousand, # [ {C and, } + # {C and, } ] {D you know, } # different perspectives, # -	24
What are your favorite shows?	31
# He was ancient,	24
{F Oh, } [ do you live, +  where do you, ]	39
What.	14
[ [ [ one, + one, ] + one h-, ] +  one humorous ] retort I [ heard, + heard ] someone, {D you know, } who claimed that, {D you know, }  AIDS was, {D you know, } God's punishment -- -- was that, then lesbians must be God's chosen people.	24
{F oh, } I'm definitely going to be -- -- actively looking into that.	36
Right.	15
<<very faint>> uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{D So, } -	26
{D So, } {F uh. }	26
Huh.	15
Just have to live with it, I guess.	8
{C And } I told her when she had [ her, + her ] little girl.	24
{C And } you go crazy thinking it might be yours.	24
Yeah.	15
Oh.	15
{D You know, } she really didn't know my name or anything, {D you know, }	24
{C And } I find that for [ a normal, + {D you know, } everyday things. ] It's really very easy to work on	9
we live on a lesser budget so that we have -	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } it does.	36
# Yeah. #	15
{C and, } {F uh, } {D well } of course, Oldsmobile has got one,	24
<Laughter> {C and, } {F uh, } down here, we eat a lot more fried foods, I think.	24
My husband always says he earns it, and I have to spend only what he earns <laughter>.	24
she really is.	24
{F Oh, } he's interesting.	9
-- {C and } the barber got a call while I was there, {F uh, } from his son's school.	24
Yeah.	4
really	15
yeah,	26
Oh.	29
Yeah.	15
They've got catalytic converters,	24
Yeah.	15
Hello.	6
{C But, } -	26
{D Well, } I can't use that as an  excuse because I didn't do it before	9
Uh-huh.	15
it's  [ just a, + just a ] topic,	24
-- {C and then } # they could have done that well at home. #	9
{C But } I think, I'd like to see college athletes, -	9
Really.	15
{C but } -- -- <Talking> the federal one's the big one <laughter>.	9
I think we both agree [ it's, + it's ] one of those deals that, {F uh, } -	9
{F Oh, } is that right?	12
{C and } I think that would be great if they could get something organized along those lines.	9
{D Well, } course  ((   ))  <<inaudible mumbling>>  [ it, + it ] is a big factor in having an understanding of how much parents will pay and how much has to come from other sources and you're willingness, one, [ to, + to ]   work during the summer  [ or, + or ] -- -- part time. And [ two, +  {F uh, } [ to, + to ] ] take out loans to  assume, {F uh, } debt after college.	9
I have a girl and a boy,	24
{C So }  [ we just, + we try ] to spend as much time as we can.	24
{F uh, } just so we [ don't, + haven't ] been able to take really. -	24
Uh-huh,	15
I think, {D you know, } it's created by, -	9
Yeah.	15
{C And } we've taken, our tents though, loaded them up in car carrier <lipsmack> and decided we were going to tent most of the way.	24
{C But, } which [ that + ] doesn't make any sense to me either.	24
uh-huh. #	15
[ it's, + it's ] fun getting together with immediate family.	9
No,	27
Yeah.	15
it really is.	36
We don't too many major, {F um, } expenses at this point,	24
Right.	15
Right.	15
{D So, }  {F uh, } -	26
{C but } I wonder if they would take, -	24
Forty deaths.	24
{C and } that's, {D you know, } one reason that I did it -- -- # is [ because, + # because ] whenever you travel anywhere near the border, {D you know, } there more and more people speak Spanish.	9
{D You know, } it's just really weird,	9
Uh, I, I know I've seen like, uh, -	26
Right.	15
# {D Well } what # do y-, -	26
[ How, + how  ] do you look at  (( counting ))  credit cards?	31
Yeah,	15
[ An-, + {C and } ] usually [ it has been + when we have gone, it has been ] nice.	24
we have a C B S twenty-four hour station -- -- that I listen to on the way to and from work	24
Uh-huh.	15
In any of them since eighty-one.	24
# I love it down there. #	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C But, } {F uh, } right now our neighborhood is running about, {F uh, } eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed, sometime during [ their, +  their, ] {F uh, } existence in that neighborhood.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C so } you've been all through Europe.	8
it's very cheap to make a slapstick movie.	9
I don't know,	34
[ the three, + the three ]  Baltic, {F uh, } republics got out as quickly as they could.	24
{C so } it's actually tough this year,	24
That's the, -	26
{D Well, } that may be.	36
{C or, } as I say, [ th-, + ] I prefer the light movies that, {F uh, } -	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } <breathing> she really was good.	9
I was tur-, -	26
It's going to be really tough for them  to swallow,	9
{D Well, } it was around here last night,	11
{C and } I didn't feel   like talking about it,	24
Yeah,	15
{D so, } {D see, } [ there, +  there ] they would have a doubt about you, that, {D you know, } -	24
I'm not kidding you	24
{C but } men have to be convinced of that.	9
It's a little more convenient,	9
[ you're, + you're ] like a boat ride from, -	24
Uh-huh.	27
<Laughter>.	20
I just sleep better or something.	24
Okay,	15
{D Well, } we got it cleared up eventually.	24
Yeah,	30
if you don't like it, shoot, move on to something else.	18
{F Uh, } I don't know if we are particularly adventurous,	9
He's still out partying.	24
three hundred dollars.	24
{F Oh, } sure.	15
{C or } you would increase the length [ of the, + of each ] term of a Congressman.	9
I'm a computer scientist.	24
No professionals <squeak>.	24
And then, {F um, } whether, {D you know, } they're a foreign author or whatever, {F um, } or if it's their style [ or, + or ] just understanding the material.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } that's pretty much the way [ we do, + {F um, } {E or } we did ] in the past,	24
Are we tonight?	7
[ It was, + It was ] good talking to you.	38
it's coach pitch, until you get nine -- -- which my little boy will be nine in May.	24
Sure.	15
I'm glad.	24
<Laughter> I know,	36
{F Huh. }	15
# Yeah. #	15
Yeah,	15
We've, had just a few, {D you know, } that freezes a little here and there,	24
Have you ever done that,	7
<Sniffing>.	20
<Ringing> {C But } she actually killed the furrier.  Or someone,	24
Yeah,	36
Uh-huh,	38
{C but, }  {F uh, } {D well, } I'm right, -	26
Yeah.	15
It really is.	36
Uh-huh.	15
It's INFORMATION WEEK.	24
{D Well, } {D you know, } at three # years old # -- -- I don't find that to be a behavioral problem # <laughter>. # {D You know } <laughter>.	9
Uh-huh,	15
I know it <laughter>.	24
# {C But, }  # -	26
[  How, + how ] do you use it?  <Laughter>.	39
Uh-huh.	15
<Laughter> Fried chicken.	30
Yeah.	36
Yeah.	36
# Uh-huh. #	15
at least, [ I, + I ] just consider myself blessed that I can stay home <laughter>.	9
{F uh, }  my wife [ enj-, + she likes ] the suspense movies.	24
<Laughter>  Is he a meat and potato person?	7
Exactly.	36
{C and } I was, {F uh, } [ doing a language, + trying to learn their language, ] a little bit.	24
[ it, + it ] was {D like }  seven dollars and something.	24
of  course you're going to lose some that way --	24
Just leave them alone,	9
Oh.	15
{D You know, } I'm sorry,	41
Yeah.	15
We did a lot of different things.	24
{F Um, } <Laughter>.	15
# {C but } # -- -- {F uh, } # not to where she feels different,	24
{C and } their parents are constantly justify them rather then to, -	9
{D well, } [ it's a, + it's ] a Town Car,	24
{F Huh. }	26
{C And } by the end of February, the way they do it nowadays.	24
# {F Oh, } yeah,	36
I haven't seen it,	24
# Uh-huh.  #	15
{C and } he's about ready to put in a pool and things like that.	24
Yeah.	15
No,	36
I don't know,	19
I can remember my mother  getting in trouble if, {D you know, } one of was sick,	24
Uh-huh.	15
I see.	29
Yeah,	15
her dad was a doctor	24
{C And } I said I'll do it for three months	24
yeah.	15
Did puppy go to?	7
{D actually } I guess this summer [ I, + I ] wore some fairly nice jeans -- -- {F uh, } more than I have in previous seasons.	24
{C and then } [ when + ] I would come home	24
{F Uh, } they classify most of them as professionals.	11
{F Oh, } okay.	15
# Okay. #	15
{C and, } my husband and I have just elected that if that happens, I will go and just pay.	24
actually the sewing isn't the hard part,	24
[ we would be, + # we would # be ] able to keep it wherever we wanted to in space or the ocean research whatever we wanted to do,	9
[ {C and, } +  {C and } ] the summer [ we have a, + we have [ a, + a ] ] reunion [ in, + in ] Salt Lake area up by Park Cities. Where we're going to camp for a week with as many members [ of, + of ] a rather large reunion group [ that, + ] {F uh, } as we can get together	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Um, } we spend a lot of time at the playground	24
{C so, } {F uh, } [ I, + I  ] just as soon have all the slushy snow on the streets than have the ice on the streets	9
[  It is before one of the, + I think it is before the ] First Baptist in Sherman airs.	24
Up there, {F uh, } it was hardly ever heard of	24
That's one idea.	24
{C and } I have a twenty-two or a twelve gauge shotgun.	24
I had a recipe from that, {F um, } INTERNATIONAL COOKBOOK TWO, that's a great salad in summertime.	24
{D Well, } you too,	38
{E I mean } # -- -- she sort of went, {D you know, } bananas	24
Yeah.	15
[ it's just a real, +  I have a real ] problem with the whole system.	24
# Oh. #	15
[ he's, + he's ] from Dallas.	24
{F Oh, } very suspenseful.	24
no	32
# {C But } we enjoy # trying, {F uh, }  different kinds of chicken or, {F uh, } [ sh-, +  {D you know, } even, {F uh, } shrimp, ] {F uh, }  dishes that are fixed in a Chinese restaurant.	24
Yeah,	36
Yeah,	15
{C and } I know there's a lot of pollutants  we can't even see coming out of -- -- cars,	9
but at least we're, we're going to the source of the problem.	9
I just don't know if we would really use it that much.    {D You know. }	24
Yeah,	36
Total indifference, {D you know, }	9
<Laughter>.	20
driving for Thanksgiving,  that's going to be quite a drive for, -	9
{F Oh, } okay.	29
he didn't have anyone to play it.	24
{C So } I think that there's a great advantage to a credit card in those situations.	9
basically you're [ baking, + baking ] chicken [ in a, + in an  ] open pan, {F um, } having marinated it first	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
-- {C and } I'm sure when your children grew up you didn't, {D you know, } -	9
No,	33
[ that's, we, +  that's what we're ] searching, {F uh, }	24
Yeah.	15
You're a sophomore,	29
{E I mean, } I remember reading an article that said {D like, } it's, {F uh, } the older polluters,	24
Yeah.	4
They're more interested in, -	24
{D Well, } what do you  think about, -	31
they would just roll themselves around all over the place	24
{C And } it doesn't matter what restrictions you put on that type of weapon or a class three firearm.	9
I know it's probably late for you,	9
they use both.	24
Pardon?	14
<Laughter>.	20
Right.	15
{D Well, } let's see,	17
{C And } [ I, + I ] been praying that God would put a desire to read the Bible <laughter> in my heart	24
{F Um, } [ the, + the ] team I live and die with {D actually } is the Red Sox, mostly die,	5
[ What, + what ] does, -	39
Or, {D you know, } plead insanity.	22
{C but } then, afterward, we all wound up taking extra art history classes, because it just seemed like [ something, + something ] we didn't totally know nothing about, but just enjoyed very much doing, # and something I # would never would have done [ if, + if ] I wasn't forced to take it.	24
Do you have a chance to look through the WALL STREET JOURNAL?	7
{C and } if I want something, I will get it.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
How far away do they come from?	39
{F Oh, } is that right?	12
{C and then } I worked for Dragon Systems for a while.	24
Yeah.	36
{C and } that's it.	24
{C So } you eat all your meals out.	22
{F Uh, } gosh.	21
Uh-huh.	15
# {E I # mean, } it, -	26
{C so, } -	26
I think it's important that  everyone know, {D you know, } basically [ how, + how ] the darn engine works,	9
{F Oh, } me, too.	24
It isn't?	12
Okay.	38
# {C And } # I also notice that the children that come over here to play -- -- that go to daycare every day -- -- they don't like to be around adults.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } we're pleased with it in terms of comfort, and, {F uh, } driveability.	24
((   ))  we have lean-tos up here.	24
Is that right?	12
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } the grandchildren are in their seventies and eighties.	24
yeah	15
[ {C And, } + {C and so } [ [ [ [ [ I, + I, ] + I, ] + I ]  really, + I used ] to watch a fair number of foreign films.	24
{C But } then [ they're, + they're  ] also entitled to drag it through the courts -- -- for years and years -- -- and years on appeals.	9
Right,	36
{C and } we're try-, -	26
I think they're going in by choice.	9
We-, because I, she loves, she's one of those that loves th-, outside,	24
How do you get your news mostly?	39
{C And, } {F uh, } around here on the, {F uh, } east coast, {F uh, } we were heavy into affirmative action.	24
{C and } this year [ we're leaving, +  {F uh, } {F uh, } matter of fact we're leaving ]  next Saturday for New Orleans.	24
Bye.	38
[ {C And, } +  {C and } ] it, -	26
{F Huh. }	26
uh-huh,	4
I'm sure that virtually everybody in the neighborhood,  that's their first homes --	24
{C And } [ that's, + {D you know, } that's ] contributed,	9
{F Uh, } some things they do, [ w-,  w-, + ] one of them is they're using corn in fuel.	24
Yeah,	36
There's no doubt about that --	36
I know.	21
{F Oh, } uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } that's tough.	21
# What's that. #	39
{C But } I'm glad it's not too totally cheap, because if it was too cheap I would talk myself out of going more, probably.	24
how old, is your oldest?	39
Yeah,	36
Oh.	29
Great.	21
It's sad to think that we would do that to people,	9
Robert De Niro?	14
# That's right. #	36
that's fabulous.	9
let's talk about college basketball.	18
{C but } [ I don't think, + I honestly don't think ] that's the biggest part of it.	9
# Yeah. #	15
{D you know, } we lived in, {F uh, } Minneapolis when the Northwest Airlines pilot in the Dakotas, -	24
Yeah.	15
[ {C and, } +  {C and } ]  now I'm looking for a job before they have to send me back home --	24
Electronic mail.	9
Right.	15
Okay,	15
[ it, + it ] really is.	36
{F Um, } LIFE EXTENSIONS.	24
yeah,	26
-- {C and } it's a fun field.	24
Okay.	15
{D Well, } where do you take those things?	39
{F Uh, } {C but } it has to be not just at the national level  but at [ the, + {D you know, } the ] state and the local level, too.	9
I think it  backfired.	24
it, {F uh, } -	26
uh-huh.	36
<Laughter>  {D Well, }	3
for the most part.	24
Yeah.	36
{C and } <laughter>, kids loved him,	9
{F Huh. }	15
At the same time you think, {D God, } I hope I don't sound like  a stage mother because, # right now # if you ask my friends t-, put twenty  mothers in a room and ask them how many have gifted children, you're going to have twenty hands,  {D you know, } # up there. #	9
Yes,	36
I think that everybody is aware of that	9
{C and then } [ I could, + I could ] upgrade now if I wanted to	24
{C And, }  eventually I brought it up to [ a, + a  ] place called Just Brakes --	24
[ Is it, + is it ] this year they don't have a draft pick because of the Walker trade	7
{C and, } # {F uh, } # there are so many that  look like they would just be absolutely wonderful.	9
[ {C And, } not -- + -- {C and  then } again not ] everything,	24
[ he's, + {F uh, } he was  ] a real psycho in the movie.	24
I would have to say that, {F uh, } some of the ones that consistently put out good materials, {F uh, } {D you know, }	24
I think they're doing real good job.	36
I don't know.	19
yeah.	36
<Laughter>.	20
I would think that that's where it would come through.	24
just the other night on H B O we watched THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, # again	24
That's the N B A?	7
{C and } that's, -	26
Very definitely so.	36
that's it,	36
Yeah,	15
{F Oh, } a entertainment type center?	22
there's just so many, such variation	9
Was it, -	7
[ I just, + {D you know, } I can just ]  drift off into some other world just listening to that for hours if I ever have the time to do that,	24
{C but } {D you know, } it wasn't a bad movie.	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ [ That, + that, ] + that ] is a shame that we have this tremendous border of Mexico,	9
for a hobby or for, -	7
Uh-huh.	15
Um.	15
{D So, } I guess we're supposed to talk about foods today.	24
I know, I was,	24
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } {D see, } [ I'm not, + {F uh, } I'm not ] a dog  person at all <laughter>.	24
[ I, + I ] agree.	36
Huh,	15
hadn't thought about that.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } right now we don't have a girls'   league because I'm the one that's supposed to start one	24
{D Well, } {E I mean, } I think, -	9
uh-huh.	36
{C And } I'll [ get, + get ] stuff out of that.	24
(( )) so much more to learn now that it really makes it more difficult, I would think.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{D So, } {F oh, } well,	15
# {F Oh, } yeah.	36
that explains it doesn't it.	7
{C and } I can not remember the name of it, {F uh, }	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
which group are you saying #  is the one trying? #	39
Yeah <breathing>.	15
I think he should.	9
{C but } I'm concerned with who's going to have the power over this new  world order that they keep talking about, {D you know. }	24
Oh.	15
{C and } I tried even tying a pillow to it.	24
{C and, } {D you know, } [ it's a, + it's  a ] credit to them as far as how they're doing <laughter> things.	24
the back half is my garden.	11
# Uh-huh. #	15
Okay.	15
I did not need it.	24
That's right.	36
We were very heavy into that.	24
{E I mean } right next to us is such a pitiful country.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Two, -	24
I'm not too sure,	19
{C And so } I, th-, -	24
I went, what. {D You know, }	24
{C and } she just liked having kids	24
{F Uh, } nowadays it's not the case,	9
{F Uh, } I live in Texas now.	24
no,	33
I think that, {F uh, } Reagan and  Bush were up to their necks in that Iran Contra thing,	9
we grow those here, too,	24
{C And then } just like the glass bottles, that it says on the bottle I can get ten cents, but not in Texas.	24
(( )) [ [ It didn't, + it, ] + it ] took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans.	24
I think it's time we had a lady abuse the guys movie.  <laughter>	9
I get to here about Texas again a bit and get to talk to people all over the country,	24
{E I mean, } [ it's, + it's  ] not,	26
I kind of like having them for, {F uh, } gasoline purchases.	24
{D Well, } I have a V C R	24
{F Oh, } a little bit.	11
I think it's still, {D you know, } [ I + ] adding up,	9
{C and } it worked out pretty good.	24
Right.	11
You really can't get a pit bull from birth that's that way.	24
Okay.	38
{D Well, } I sit and design cards --	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } it just had a very good activities director.	24
I don't anymore,	24
{C and } now, # they're # throwing in a little news and a little bit of other stuff.	13
guy just <noise>, {D you know, } -	26
one doesn't go in July <laughter>.	24
<Laughter>.	20
right.	15
# I # don't know a judge might be a little more cold-blooded about it.	9
sure.	15
I wouldn't think so <laughter>.	9
It's, {F uh, } the logistics of the thing that, {F uh, } gets you going.	9
Yeah.	15
# yeah. #	4
And, and you have to, I guess you have to question too, why a lot of the men, especially, I think middle age and older men, why they feel that way	9
Yeah.	15
{F Uh, } I don't know, {F uh, } I suppose they also, not being a state are probably freer to determine their own, {F um, } ways of life than they would [ if, + if, ] -	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C But } these individuals, if they have a gun with them,  I think that [ the, + the ] sentence should be even longer than if they don't.	9
# After you retire,	22
# Uh-huh. #	15
{F Oh } [ it is, + it's ]  a candy,	25
Yeah,	15
{D Well, } [ [ [ are you ever, + are you, ] + [ b-, + ] are you, ] + are you ] married <laughter>?	7
[ E-, +  everyone ] I talk to, they says,  {D you know, } -	24
# Yeah. #	15
I think, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
What's the, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
# Uh-huh,	15
As though -- -	26
I don't have to worry about that	24
I think it was an especially good winter for fall colors.	24
Yeah.	15
Oh.	15
{C And, } {F uh, } now that was very competitive.	24
Why is it happening?	39
{C and } [ who, + ] all of us have weaknesses of one kind or another.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } that causes a lot of trouble.	9
Really.	15
{F Oh, } {F um, } have you seen THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY, PART TWO?	7
If you, if I were dying, I'm not sure I would care.	9
-- {C and, } {F uh, } kind of have, -	26
yeah.	26
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
You know a car I ran across recently  that has a tremendously large trunk is the Lincoln Continental.	24
Right,	15
Yeah,	15
{C and } I think he's mentioned <noise> {F uh, } the Oakland A -s a couple of times.	24
yeah.	26
Yeah,	4
Uh-huh.	15
Oh.	15
I have heard, -	24
{C but } you hear much of the same music, perhaps a new version of it,	24
# {F Oh, } is he?  #	12
Yeah.	15
# <Laughter>. #	20
I really like them,	24
Yeah.	15
Right.	38
he wanted  (( new one )) , -	22
There's where individuals will <swallowing> in one, primarily babysit -- -- children in their own home.	24
Bye.	38
I think a lot of people were, {F uh, } leaving Michigan all about the time I came here in the early eighties	9
uh-huh.	15
{C and } [ you ca-, + you can ] get to them.	9
<Inhaling> I've just never <breathing>, -	26
unless it's there and we're just not seeing it.	24
{D Well, } {F um, } {D so } it sounds like you keep your pets for pleasure.	9
<Laughter>.	20
{D Well, } [ [ [ I, + I, ] + i-, ] + we're ] at liberty [ to, + to ] talk [ and, + and ]  meander as long as it's all on the same theme.	34
{F Uh, } it's nine thirty here.	24
I don't care anything about that.	24
they didn't have a price on it, nor did they know had a it would cost,	24
Colorado.	24
Yeah,	4
"they're number one priority was that, {F um, } they're children didn't  have to leave their home <smack>.    *[[transcript error--spelling of initial ""they're"" should be ""their""]]"	24
{C or, } -	26
Yeah.	26
Yeah.	15
Really.	15
[ {C and } yet, + {C and } yet, ] I know [ that I, +   that, -	19
{C But } I teach school	24
{C so } I bought a couple of books about how to buy a house and what to look for, {D you know. } # [ And, + # or ] how to repair this or repair that in your own home.	24
{C and } now I have a little blanket	24
{C or, } -	26
{C And } crab, they don't bite like that,	24
[ [ it's, + it's, ] + {D you know, } she's ]  kept it up real well,	24
{C But } the one thing, my house is a little bit different	24
Yeah,	15
{D so. } -	26
{C but, } I'd like to have one.	24
I avoid the sun <laughter>.	24
{F oh, } yeah.	4
Uh-huh.	15
they're {C either } moonlighting {C or } else [ their, + their ] wife works, too.	9
<Noise> Okay <laughter>.	13
probably within a year I would like  to buy a new car.	24
{D Well, } yeah,	15
{C but, } a lot of the things that brought feminism, {E I mean } there are just  more women [ [ in, + in, ] + in ] the demographics, just generally, # in the # United States, in terms of being, -	9
Uh-huh.	15
well if you're off, off, of a, you know, away from a road, -	9
[ [ It's just, + it's, ] + it's ] ridiculous.	9
[ [ What, + what, ] + # what ]  are green fees run there?	39
Yeah,	36
{D Well, } did you go to college?	7
Uh-huh.	15
<Thumping>.	20
{D Well, } I was kind of hoping with, -	24
-- what it is.	26
# Yeah. #	15
-- {C so } [ even, + even ] into {D like } November and December I was still wearing the short sleeve dresses,	24
Okay.	29
Uh-huh.	15
it's also just [ I've, + I've ]  often pictured, {F uh, } in my mind, {D you know, } [ what it would be like to just, + what would you find if you just ] [ kept on going, + kept on going? ]	16
[ I, + {D well, } it, ] -	26
{C But. } -	26
Yeah,	15
yeah.	15
{D Well, } I have a ninety Honda Civic,	24
{F Uh, } [ I, + I ] don't see any problem [ with, + with ]  testing for random drugs.	9
Yeah.	15
I worry every now and then,	24
we suspect that he  [ was hurt in an accident, +  {D you know, } got away from somebody traveling through, and hurt in an accident ] -- -- because a dog that looks as good  as he does and is trained as well is someone that has lost him and  not have been able to locate him.	9
You, too,  (( Tonya )) .	38
Uh-huh.	15
What kinds of things have you done?	39
{C but } prices might go down lot more.	9
yeah.	26
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } <Laughter>  (( {C and } ] of course )) , -	26
Oh, goodness.	15
in my opinion, -	26
{C And then } a month later, I had to dispute it in writing,	24
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } he's probably playing himself.	9
{F Huh. }	26
[ It's a real, + it is a real ] nice facility.	24
{D Well, } that isn't too bad.  Just a couple of hours.	13
I can  imagine, {D you know, } if you're driving cross country, {D you know, } {F uh, } listening to a story.	24
{C And } we use that usually to buy gasoline,	24
{C So } [ there's, # +  I don't, # think there's ] any way to control the criminal element as far  as guns is concerned  because, -	9
Two babies,	22
{C But, }  if you're going to tell the kids they [ c-, + ] have to dress up, I guess you can tell the teachers that, too.	9
I'll talk to you later.	38
of the matter, -	26
Did we cover everything we need to?	38
Okay,	15
{C and } all this stuff is seeping through to the water,	24
{C and } I [ don't, + don't see ] it in them yet,	24
I think [ it's, + it's ] catching on  throughout the country <TV>.	9
<Laughter> Mama got run over by the train.	25
right,	15
I don't enjoy preparing three meals a day everyday <laughter>.	24
Okay.	38
{F Uh, } one of it's great slogans  is if you're not serving the customer, you better be serving someone who is.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
<Child_laughing>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
I know.	21
Yeah,	15
{C and, }  {F um, } [ they, + they ] may have gone down a little  bit	24
{C or } [ not, + not ] so much a toss up  but [ a, + a ] dilemma [ when, + when ] you want a country to have [ its, + its, ] {F um, } own, {F uh, } dominion, or its free rein over [ its, + its ] own people.	9
My husband worked at a gas station when he was a teenager.	24
Yeah,	15
{C and, }  {F um, } there's hardly, -	24
Yes.	15
{C but, } {F uh, } that stuff going on over there. -	9
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	36
I'm -- -- getting older and, {F uh, } not sure that's  something I want to do.	24
I have only {D like } two or three favorite television shows.	24
# Right. #	15
{C So, }  {F uh, } they got along great,	24
No kidding,	21
I guess they could call them that, but  [ they're, + they're ] more just a screened in, {F uh, } camping area -- -- whatever,	24
Uh-huh.	15
I am a real solid sleeper  though <laughter>	24
[ It, + it ] is when you do it that way.	21
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
{D You know, } we had prohibition for awhile	24
I was always, # just # more aware of her jer-, {D you know, } -	24
Maybe not as much as now	9
Okay.	13
[ they just,  + they ]  had a ball romping around,	24
{F Uh, } {C but } I think a person needs a way of defending themselves.	9
{F Uh, } basically I'm at home	24
when I had it, [ I, + I ]  watched it, {D you know, } religiously for half an hour	24
and I came back here	24
You know, what I mean?	7
{D You know, } {C but } I'm not  convinced, [ [ that's, + [ a-, + ] tha-, ] + that ] Social Security is doing as well as it should  [ [ [ [ [ [ {C and, } + {D you know, } {C and, } ] + {C and, } ] +  {C and, } {F uh, } ] +  {C and, } ] + {C and } ] that,  {D you know, } those people who need it for  welfare and so forth, who really need it for welfare, not the eighty-five to ninety  percent of them who don't need it.  But {E I mean } the real people who really  need it, {D you know, } should be getting it	24
You can't get away from it	9
Yeah,	36
{C But, } {F uh. }  It's gone pretty well.	24
{D Actually, } [ I, + {F uh, } I ] guess I am <laughter>.	24
[ [ I, + I've, ] + I've ] always prided myself <laughter>  on not being prejudiced and [ being, + ] {D you know, } {F uh, } [ welcome, + welcoming ] everyone -- -- that wants to come here.	9
You know what I'm saying	8
Okay <laughter>, {F uh, }	36
For the issues  [ that, + {D you know, } <child_yelling> that ] I felt really strong for, {F uh, } I think apathy has set in to a lot of # people # -- -- because of <child_yelling> the way  our politicians are and the way our country is being run.	24
{D Well, } {C and } that's an individual thing.	9
First, it was the airlines then it was banks [ and, +   and, ] {F uh, } {F um, } savings association, and whatnot.	9
<laughter>.  That's true.	15
Do you really?	12
Yes,	36
The problem there is that they've been let out jail.	9
Right.	15
That is, -	26
I'm sure your classes were a lot smaller, {F um, }  because {D like } we would have [ biology classes that did, + main courses that ]  everyone has to take, {E I mean, } hundreds of students in this class,	24
# Yeah, #	36
I am a missionary --	24
{C And  so } the kids in some ways [ [ are, + are, ] + are  ] suffering a little bit, in that, {F uh, } [ [ the model, + the role models  ] that get +  [ [ the, +  the, ] + the  ] family issues that get  ] discussed, and all these, I think are very important parts of them growing up,	9
{D Well } maybe that's something that needs to be worked on.	9
Yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } my apartment is three fifteen a month	24
Two cats,	30
{C And } we kept trying, {D you know, }	24
isn't # that funny? {F Uh, }  [ but,  just, + ] that they were able to do it, # {D you # know, }	7
<Laughter>.	20
{C or, } -	26
{F Uh, } can't afford it.	24
{D Well } the prizes are pretty nice.	24
{F Um, } I think about the only night that I really sit in front of the T V set all  night long probably is on Monday night.	24
{C So, } the thing [ is, + is ] basically that I spend, {D like, } maybe thirty-five, forty dollars every two weeks [ on, + on ] groceries	24
{D Well, } do you work in that C building?	7
{D Well, } tell me about it.	18
{C But } it's hard to find, {F uh, } an actual exercise regimen that work, for you, {D you know, } because {D like } I know a lot of people that cycle, they take their kids behind them on the bikes	24
Oh.	29
irregardless of what Soviet policy is, they're going to do what the general tells them.	9
{D Well, } I don't know,	19
And you didn't even, -	26
Right,	36
I sure do.	24
{D Well, } the armed forces did so much to, {D you know, }  Agent Orange,	9
They do.	36
right.	15
Yeah,	15
{C and } I'm real happy with that.	24
{C and } when you work hard and you're under  pressure and everything all week long, a boat can be a lot of relaxation, {F uh, }  [ to + ] especially with a group of friends and -- -- cook out or camp out or whatever, {F uh, } or a cabin or something, depending on how much you like to rough it.	9
Right.	36
that's something [ that, + that ] I guess I have not much of an image of other [ than, + than ] Puerto Rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something not in a  (( perjuritive )) sense but in a, in a carefree sense,  I guess.	24
[ I don't, + I don't ] drink,	24
it's a fairly new area.	24
It depends.	40
Yeah.	15
{C and then } I distributed them	24
Well, have we come up with a solution yet, Salina?	7
[ I really haven't, + I really haven't, ] {F uh, } <breathing> -	26
Yeah.	15
{F Uh, } {C but } occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher [ when, + when ] you start using more than a few --	9
I understand that.	24
Uh-huh.	15
right.	15
I agree.	36
Yeah.	15
{F Uh, } do you want to go ahead and start?	18
Yeah. #	4
I have worked outside of the home	24
# Yeah. #	15
That's right.	36
{C And } it really sounded like it was fun.	24
How neat.	21
I haven't thought about that.	24
{D Well, } I don't either	36
{D Well } you should of just ripped the whole thing out.	18
Seems I read, -	26
Free.	30
# Right. #	15
{C so, } -	26
{C and } [ I don't, + {D you know, } # I # don't ]  allow that when he's at home	24
Are you?	23
I'm a pediatrician {D actually. }	24
Yeah.	15
You still there?	7
exactly <laughter>.	36
{C And } {E I mean, } I still, unfortunately have to be very disciplined <laughter> in doing my work at five in the morning and ten o'clock at night,	24
[ My, + my ] grandmother is not in a nursing home	24
{C but } then I started school again,	24
Generally, I don't think they are.	5
I guess [ that's, + that's ]  primarily was one of my thoughts, {D you know, } because, you know how government is <laughter>.	9
{D Well, } listen I enjoyed speaking with you.	38
{C so } that's, {D you know, } -	26
Really?	12
Yeah,	36
that's not quite authentic,	24
{D See } how they'd like it under another flag.	9
She likes to spend on anything and everything <laughter>.  With body lotion, everything <laughter>.	24
Right.	15
I was think, -	26
#Yes.#	36
{C Because } we have just been looking all over for him.	24
{F Uh, } [ you, + you've ] got the question you can go first there, since I called.	18
# {D Well } I, # -	26
Uh-huh.	15
I was in Peru,	24
{F Uh, } I get in a rut with credit cards cause they get me kind of in a vicious cycle.  Where you use them a lot one month and then you have to use whatever money you have to pay those off --	24
Uh-huh.	15
That's true.	36
{C But }  [ [ it was, + it was,  ] + it was  ] one of those that kept you on the edge of your seat.	24
[ I, + I  ] really kind of did.	24
Yeah.	36
Yeah,	15
Okay,	29
You just have to. -	26
yeah. #	36
((   )) .	20
sad little things.  {F Uh, } I felt sorry for them.  Because their society isn't there anymore,	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	36
# Right,	36
well I guess they're intermediate.	9
I like this <laughter>.	24
I mean, these people can't, you know, #stay there till eight o'clock# -- -- because somebody has to work late	9
[ {C and, } +  {C and } ] they  really  (( seem ))  as wise	9
Yeah.	15
{C and, } {D you know, } the last I heard it was costing ten, twenty, thirty thousand dollars a year, <breathing> {F uh, } to keep these guys waiting.	24
I was driving a sixty-six Plymouth Fury.	24
He's not  [ a, +  the ] liability [ that he was, + that he used ] to be.	24
{C But } we always got that,	24
<Inhaling>.	20
{C And } the guy lives in with her, {D you know, }	24
{C and } they were offering [ a, + a ] walking class, where [ you, +  {D you know, } you ]  have to walk, {D you know, } [ that + ] like for every mile you walk and every so many  minutes, [ you get, +  you get ] points,  {D you know, }	24
There you go.	13
they don't learn the thought processes of other fields [ of, + of ] endeavor.	24
Yeah.	30
I think the world record is fifty some pounds.	24
Yeah.	15
now blacks --	30
that will not do.	24
Yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
the, -	26
overbuilding [ is, i-, + has ] been a real problem there.	24
[ Exa-, + Exactly, ]	36
Now we, -	26
-- {C and then } [ we, + {F uh, } we ]  swept sand in between,	24
{F Oh, } my.	21
{C And } I'm, -	26
I'd rather just be the student, <laughter>.	24
{F Oh, } great.	21
I have, {F uh, } [ a, +  a ] Chowperd myself.	24
# or # co-dependency, or, {D you know, }  fifty thousand things like John Bradshaw's books on, {F uh, } THE FAMILY and -- -- HOMECOMING and INNER CHILD, and so	24
{F Oh } --	26
They say I want to pay for this and this and this and this and this.	24
I felt like we roughed it then <laughter>.	24
{C but } there is one that's out in this big lake	24
Considering that  Spock was on [ an, + ] {F uh, } {D you know, } couple weeks ago -- -- and that [ the, + the ] very first episode of  NEXT GENERATION, they had McCoy.	24
Well what can we do about the, the, the, the air conditioning problem?	39
I think he's up in a attic, or some part of school.	24
and I'm like, ugh, you know.	24
Who takes care of that?	39
{C because } it -	26
{C And } {D like } in Pennsylvania for babies, that's what I work  with, there has to be a one to four ratio at the most. No more than four babies per care giver.	24
{C so } you can <laughter>  talk to them when they're out running around with friends <noise>.	9
Right,	36
We're becoming a service country.	9
{D Well, } {F um } probably the best one that  [ I, + I ] know of and I work with all the time is called SEARCH FOR SIGNIFICANCE -- -- by Robert McGee --	24
That is the WASHINGTON POST --	8
[ It's, + it's ] very, very good.  Very good.	24
[ what's, + what's ] the lady's name?	39
[ I, + although I ] think that, -	9
{D Well, } we have been drenched.	24
{C and } they have, some excellent programs right there on site.	24
{C and } not many things you can play [ that'll, +  {D you know, } people will ]  sit there and sing along to	24
{C so } when you turn in the cans unsmashed, you're just, {D like, }  reimbursed.	22
{C So } you definitely get to try before you buy.	24
we have some engineers that  still, on their, {F uh, } -	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ It's kind of, + it's kind of ] disappointing.	24
I float -- -- so that I have no benefits except higher pay -- -- for doing that.	24
my husband and I have been married twenty six years,	24
{C and } I have been to downtown Boston.	24
{C and } she can pick her hours	24
{C So } what we could  do is take all the retired people that are going around in their big mobile homes and they could do public service all over the country.	9
Sixty-six.	24
All you have to do is have a sharp mind,	9
{C but } when he graduated he had a five thousand dollar bank account	24
{C and } I,  {D you know, } -	26
All right,	13
A lot of people are eating healthier now a days.	9
{C and } I heard [ that there's, + {F uh, } that you ] can bid on that stadium	24
[ that's, + that's ] funny you said that.  Because [ we got a credit card, + {F uh, } my husband and I got credit cards ] in the mail one day that we hadn't even applied for.	24
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } I don't know	19
{C and } since it slept in the castle  with its master,  (( {E I mean } ))  [ it had, + it had ] to be of a disposition <breathing> to make  it, {D you know, } an animal you could keep around that closely.	24
Oh.	15
{D Well, } that's neat.	21
they really do, they have a great time,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
-- {C and } when I went to school that just wasn't put up with.	24
Are you saying to use {D like, } {F um, } for chocolate {D like, } unsweetened,	14
Drive cars with catalytic converters, and all that.	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } he traded the other one in and got this one,	24
-- {C but } she still has, {F uh, } a security there.	22
Uh-huh.	15
# Yeah. #	15
Not yet at all.	5
Uh-huh.	15
[ her, + her ] father was murdered, her father and three other guys up here in Sherman.	24
{C and } I'll put in there,	24
[ {C and, } + {C and }  ] I think it's, {F uh, } just McDonald's effort to reduce the number [ of, + of  ] styrofoam, {F uh, } boxes that they use, for hamburgers and stuff,	24
Yeah.	15
It's the best.	9
Yeah,	15
Yeah,	15
Yeah,	36
it # just seems like since I've recently  stayed home, that is what's happened, {D you know. }	24
Uh-huh.	4
It really did.	24
-- # {C so } we read, # -	26
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] I don't give that out.	24
# {D Well, } {C and then } in a lot of, # -	9
[ I'm, + I'm ]  pursuing [ [ what they, + what's, ] + what's ] called an interdisciplinary field.	24
[ They may not, + they must not ] have too much traffic on Saturdays <sniffing>.	9
{D Well } even in the courts [ yo-, + ] {D well, } {D well, } they're all appointed.	9
Uh-huh.	15
I went to Utah State University -- -- which is in Logan, Utah --	24
{C and } you should be able to either put the guy to death	9
{C and, } you just can't believe how much paper that you, {F uh, } -	13
# the # bigger trend called the boomerang kids where they move out for a while -	9
uh-huh.	15
In fact, I am at work right now.	24
I would imagine, {D you know, } the situations are out there.	9
Yes,	4
they should be able to provide you a copy with that signature	24
and that doesn't change, you know,	9
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } [ I, + {F uh, } {D well, } I ] wouldn't exclude the possibility of the government actually administrating it ultimately.	3
<Lipsmack> Another way you could do it is weight this value by, {F uh, } the value to society of the people.   {F Uh, } which is pretty delicate thing to do.	9
{C And } this particular one has people that are in pretty bad shape.	24
{F Oh, } I see,	15
{D Well, } I don't know,	24
Uh-huh.	15
# Yeah.  #	15
{C And, }  {F uh, } that's a terrible kind of thing	9
of course, we see  smaller animals all the time,	24
We have, -	26
[ [ That, + they, ] + they ] warned me of that one finally.	24
You say you're from Atlanta.	24
[ I'm surprised that, + I was surprised ] at the ending [ of, + ] {D you know, } with all the funny things happening <breathing> and different things.	24
# Right,	36
Gosh.	21
I lived in, {F uh, } Pontiac just a little while before I came -- -- down here	24
Uh-huh,	15
{C and, } {F uh, } I know how it made me feel.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C So, } -	26
{F uh, } my  wife, {F uh, } [ has so much, + {F uh, } gets so much ] to do shopping with every couple of weeks	24
Yes.	15
{C But } even in Georgia that's the attitude for the most part.	24
Depends on how much power you have, # and who you # know.	9
Okay.	38
{D Well, } we do too.	24
{F Uh, } I remember seeing that,	24
{C And } in England, at least at the time when I was familiar with it, about ten years ago, they just told you what day you had to show up and where you had to show up and who your doctor was going to be.	24
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } wonderful,	21
Yeah.	15
I know,	36
{D Well, } some of them, yes they do	24
Yeah,	36
it didn't backlog   [ or + ] all of [ the, + {F uh, } the ] cases that are, {F uh, } all ready pending.	24
I don't remember when the horse got killed.	24
{D now, } boy,  I really need to get out, {D you know, } and apply something,  {D you know, }	25
Uh-huh.	15
Of course, I always  (( see ))  pay the bills first	24
[ I, + I  ] play [ in, + in  ]  [ lo-, + a lot  ] of groups	24
after a while <laughter> -- -- if you don't keep them weeded out, they almost take over.	9
Just for food, # it # does seem like it.	2
{C And } there would be like thirty people.	24
I guess I usually do.	11
{F Oh, } really <laughter>.	15
{C And } in, -	26
Yeah.	15
{D So, } what school is it?	39
{D Well, } [ we go, + we've gone ] to August Moon	24
{C And } this time we're going to be going with just one daughter	24
I've heard of him.	24
Yeah.	15
I see that the, -	24
{C And } all these politicians [ make, + make ] hay over, {D you know } -- -- being anticrime,	9
# I # was -- -- fourteen years old.	24
the first time I was there, [ the, + the ] tree was still standing,	24
{C because } {E I mean, } you had to pay it in full every month.	24
I know they can poll a jury,  make sure everybody agrees with what they said the verdict was,	24
{D Well, } I'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes.	24
I don't know.	19
yeah. #	15
# Bye. #	38
Yeah,	15
{C and } [ as it, + as it ] turns out, my wife has pretty decent coverage through her company. # and # can get me coverage as well. {C But } [ I, + ]  {D yeah, }  which is great.	24
Oh.	15
Right.	15
How long has it been since the first one?	39
Yeah.	15
I, {F uh, } work on my own cars	24
Right,	15
he's a black man,	24
Okay.	38
I know it.	36
in fact, our one little block and a half there, four houses sold last summer	24
I -	26
{C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } [ we, + we  ] were both pretty much happy with what we did.	24
{D well, } when my kids were little, I did have a T V set	24
Over the uncooked rice?	7
Yes.	15
I said Queen's Reich,	24
{C so. } -	26
{C but } <breathing> [ it's, +  it was ] really fun.	9
Right,	15
{F Oh, } yes,	15
{C but, }  I have never heard and I have actually never run into anyone into the china painting	24
{C But } you have to put the water in proportionally.	24
Yeah,	15
{F Uh, } {C but, } -	26
I'd like to know that the people who had them at least knew what the responsibilities were, whether they followed them or not.	9
{F Huh. }	15
It was really nice speaking to you.	38
Yeah,	15
# Yeah,	26
I think  ((   ))  {D you know, }  that's pretty typical [ that, + ] of the [ entire, +  entire ] involvement over [ that, +  {D you know, }  that ] nothing was really addressed,	9
{D Well, } some-, -	26
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
It's a tough, tough question.	9
{C and } -	26
-- {C and, } {F uh, } yet the Lakers continue to win.	24
<laughter>, that would have been nice.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
Uh-huh.	36
[ we, +  {C but } we ] bought a van last year,	24
So our next, uh, -	26
Yeah.	15
That was one of the changes that came about in the last twenty years.	24
[ I'm, + I'm ] not sure I understand what you mean.	24
Well that, uh, that I think may go on a lot	9
# Yeah. #	15
{C but } you still have to be realistic, as well, I think.	24
Yes,	36
Yeah.	36
{C so } I can get a lot of stuff down out here.	24
playoffs, -	26
{D Well } what did you think of, {F um. }  a couple years ago for the Bears, the Refrigerator.	31
Yeah,	36
What are your thinkings on what they can do, what they'll be able to do?	31
{C so. } I get the mold [ I put, + I put ] it on, {D you know, } the frosting  (( always ))  melts	13
I purchased [ a, + <breathing> a ] Chevy, {F um, } Citation.	24
Right.	15
[  I look at the, + I look at ] [ [ what, {D you know, } thi-, + what, ] + ]  the  (( aid ))  presented to the Kurds	24
Are they typos?	16
Yeah,	36
{C and, {C so }  that's, -	26
I have a girlfriend that goes for the social aspect of it --	24
# Yeah.	36
Uh-huh.	15
Right.	15
I guess so	36
Sure	36
{D So, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh <noise>.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } my husband and I haven't done  a whole lot of camping,	5
real long legs, and dark hair.	24
{C but } the economy the way it is all over, they probably cut back [ on -- + -- on ] that, because it's not, -	9
{C And so } I've got to have [ total, + almost total ] silence.	24
{C but. }  Do you, {F um, } have any ideas on anything that would make, -	7
Are you ready?	7
<laughter>.	20
"{C and } I've told them that,  matter of fact I got another letter last night from the Quality Ford Division, their still concerned about my attitude   *[[spelling ""their"" should be ""they're]]"	24
<Sniffing> Yeah,	36
How abou-, -	31
{C And } I go out and I love to # touch it	24
{D Well, } [ I, +  {F uh, } I ] cut it -- -- occasionally.	24
{C So, } [ [ the-, + ] it, + {D ((you know)), } someone ] did start a cost benefit analysis,	24
{C and } it's pretty neat.	9
{C and } I'm looking forward to just traveling.	24
Bye-bye.	38
but I think everybody can.	9
{C and } yes	24
# {F Oh, } okay.  #	15
{C so } it's kind of hard for us to visit with them, as much as I'd like to. # Because # [ [ we've, + we, ] + one thing we ] do have together is we're both musicians.	24
{C and } it does it, {F uh, } {F oh, } electronically [ some, + something,  ] # magic. #	24
That was the only thing I didn't like about lawns,	24
I think, really probably, [ they could, + they could, ] {F uh, } really, -	9
# {C and } # it's very little that anyone could do in the engineering sector as far as, {F uh, } {D you know, } hurting someone, {E I mean, }	24
-- {C and, } {F um, } because I've heard about the many  abuses, and because he had heard of so many abuses, he just didn't want that.	24
<Laughter> It's one of those slippery  attorneys coming in here.	22
I think that [ un-, + underlying ] we're all [ pretty, + probably ] not [ as, + as ] different as everybody thinks.	9
# Yeah. #	15
Right,	15
{C and, } {F uh, } this is what she had told the kids	24
{C so, } there's definitely hazards to going camping if you don't know what  you're looking at <laughter>.	9
{C and } [ we always wer-, + we always got ] together, just always.	24
Of course, he's breaking the law all the time,	9
I bet.	9
We [ sat dow-, +   made up ] different accounts {D like, } {D you know, }	24
{D You know, } we use to work out of one check book --	24
Yeah.	4
{C and } I  know that he would have sold out his mother for, {F uh, } {F uh, } shorter sentence.	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
{D You know, } # you # go out	24
Oh.	15
Hello	6
definitely.	36
I like a baked cheese cake, {D you know, }	24
{C and } I bought shoes.	24
{C and } they've [ had, + had ] a lot [ of, + of, ] {F uh, } {D you know, } layoffs lately.	24
They're not going to voluntarily say, {D Hey, } ship your garbage here.	9
Right.	15
because it's so big.	22
Yeah.	15
I was thinking primarily criminal cases.	24
{C and } I go through them	24
{C and } now he's through,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Huh. }	15
# Right.	36
I'm in Pennsylvania.	24
That's trees, {D you know, }	24
{C so } I know there is the possibility that -- -- it could be out of the area.	24
-- Uh-huh.	15
{C and then } the east part of the state has got all the bleeding hearts and all the welfare cases	9
{C and } every single Sunday night we play at the library to have a little -- -- [ out, + outdoor ] stage set up --	24
{C but, } -	26
<Laughter> Where did you cry.	28
I think our five minutes is about up anyhow.	24
{C but, } {D you know, } most of these people that down right go right [ and, +  and ] do it out of pure pleasure -- -- {F uh, } I don't, {F uh, } like to see that.	9
If you are on the street, you better belong there. Because it's not a through street.	9
Sometimes some medicines will give off [ a, + a ] false positive.	24
{D Well, } that's good.	21
-- [ a lot, + a lot  ] of people are burning wood,	24
I don't know,	19
-- [ the, + the ] mountains can accommodate you if you know what to find.	9
{E I mean, } some of the, -	9
I am using <noise> muscles that I have never used before.	24
{C and } it's very peaceful.	24
Takes a lot of room.	9
((   )) .	26
I'm not sure [ what  that, + what that ] means.	24
{F Oh, } I didn't hear it.	24
Yeah.	15
uh-huh. #	15
that's not going to be a regular feature.	24
Is that right?	7
Yeah.	15
I'm, -	26
{C but, }  {F uh, }  [ [ it's, +  it  does not, ] + it's not ] as many people there that I [ really, +  really ] enjoy seeing.	24
{C And } how do you pronounce that?	39
{C and -- -- so } I have a lot of external, {F uh, } interests --	24
[ it would be nice, + it would be nice ] to see it take a good turn here.	9
{C but } only because of Steve Bushel, I guess --	24
I mean beginning with this is, this is just for homosexuals,	24
Yeah.	15
Right <sniffing>.	15
{C and } that was the envelope system. Where you go ahead and decide about how much based on what you did last month that you are going to spend,	24
it's not,	9
{C but } I spent a year in Vermont, my freshman year,	24
Oh.	15
{C but } here in Texas we only get two channels,	24
my husband was complaining the other day	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
In Dallas?	7
{C but } hopefully the job that I will have will have lots of benefits -- -- namely lots of vacations -- -- not real good salary but lots of vacations.	24
# Yeah. #	15
{C But } that wasn't a real,  {D you know, } -	24
[ {C and } I, + {C and } I ] know that it's good for my health.	24
{C and } I guess the whole system is set up to rather let, {F uh, } some guilty  people go free than to put an innocent person [ in, +  in ] jail -- -- although you still hear about those occasionally.	9
I don't really care  for snow peas.	24
Right.	15
[ [ they're + ... {D Yeah, } they're, ] + they're ] weird.	9
{F Uh. }	15
Yeah,	36
Right.	15
[ if, + if ] you take ten million people and protect ten thousand dollars it still only a hundred [ bi-, +  billion ] dollars	24
Most of the neighborhood I'm in is pretty typical.	24
{D you know, } {F oh, } that's who the guy is.	24
Yeah,	15
They're cute.	9
{F Uh, } I don't like to go to the drive-thrus because sometimes they get your order wrong --	9
No,	33
Uh-huh.	15
I love # -- -- # comedies.	24
{C So } they had a lot of fun.	24
Texas is the big one.	38
Yeah,	15
I called my father long distance just to describe the thing,	24
Yeah,	15
{C and, } -	26
<Child>.	20
{C And } we also like Owens, {F uh } -- -- country sausa-,	24
{D Well } -- -- do we agree, or unless it's not me <laughter>. -	7
{C and } I think it has gotten more humid over the years.	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
<Laughter>.	20
[ All we, + all I ] do is, {F uh, } keep a list of things like debts that are outstanding and every two or three months update that and every once in a while make a list of what we spent that month,	24
Right.	15
Just, {F uh, } -	26
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
[ that does, + that's ] something [ you don't, + doesn't ] even sound good loud really. {D You know. }	9
a lot of times, {F uh, } the lawyers are able to pick and choose who they want on the jury	9
No,	33
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } that's true.	21
You're kidding.	21
# {F uh, } no,	33
Right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Okay.	13
Uh-huh.	15
{C so } [ I +  -- -- anything in the mountains over there I ] just love.	24
{D like }  up here, last year, the governor was up for re-election	24
Thank you for calling.	38
[ {C And, } + {C but, } ] {F uh, }  {D you know, } we don't even have vehicles that will do that.	24
{E I mean } it's always been the same	9
<Laughter>.	20
yeah.	26
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } the air conditioning was  broke,	24
{C so } she'd kind of lay it on occasionally, {D you know, } <laughter>.	24
# {C And } # I would go in,	24
Most of them I don't know their names of the song,	24
Yeah,	15
# Yeah,	36
Oh --	15
{F Oh, } d-, <laughter>, -	15
{C And } it's still, -	26
We, {F uh, } -	26
Are you all planning to move anytime,	7
{D you know, } the Aquarium is one of those things that, {D you know, } because everybody, -	24
That's okay,	27
{C but, }  {F uh, }  no,	33
I think the hardest thing for us [ has been, +  is ] to find [ ac-, +  {D you know, } leisure time activities ] that all of our kids can enjoy together -- -- with the age span that we have, {D you know, }	24
yeah,	15
{F Uh, } {D well, } I don't know about that, <breathing>	3
Yeah,	36
# {C and } # we're spending on these  [ useless, +  many times useless ] and  inordinately complex unnecessary tests in  hospitals # for older people. #	9
I don't see how you eat that, #	24
They wouldn't have to spend money advertising  and things like that.	9
Uh-huh,	36
they have such great fortune here,	9
Oh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C So, } I have not -- -- done that in years,	24
{C And } yet, {D you know, } I think about, {D you know, } -	24
{E I mean, } I, -	26
it's really, -	26
Well, tha-, that's true.	36
# Uh-huh,	15
{F Oh, } I, -	26
{C And } I think that th-, -	9
Whether it's your personal salary or whatever.	24
# {F Oh, } no,	32
{C and } what I like  to do is I like to stretch out	24
{F uh, } yeah,	4
Good.	21
Where do you call to?	39
{C But } I was real careful and visited and everything ahead of time.	24
They have been doing that.	24
{C but } [ it's, +  it's ] very good.	9
Is it?	7
Yeah.	4
{C and } it's so hot.	24
No,	32
he has a couple of times,	24
go ahead.	18
I like to watch those skins games.	24
{C but } it helps people.	24
four in a row.	24
{C And then } # you # -- -- say that's not my job,	24
Okay.	29
Craig  (( Statler ))  won in a playoff.	24
you said you've just lived in North Carolina just {D like, } # six # months then is, -	8
[ I do-, +  I don't ] know,	24
{F uh, } they pretty much got to the point,	24
yo-, # -	26
{F Uh, } I would imagine that we've  talked the amount of time # necessary. #	9
I don't work for T I	5
Uh-huh.	15
no.	36
I know at work, {F uh, } people always complain to me	24
Yeah.	15
It's a whole new, -	24
{D Well, } that's true,	36
No,	36
Uh-huh.	15
That was about it.	30
they recommend doing the video without weights for the first month	24
That's true.	21
[ {C and so } + {C and } ] I say {D well } wait a minute,	24
I have a <breathing> [ two through, + {D you know, } two through  ] wedge.	24
(( We need to just put ))  external cards in	24
{C And } I have seen them age twenty -- -- in the time [ and, + and ] with the expense and everything,	24
I get things ready and then I enjoy.	24
Is it?	7
{C but } I still don't like other people watching <laughter> me.	24
{C but then } eventually  there'll be a school project or  something where my son will need to refer back through forty-eight back issues to find -- -- {D you know, } France or something or whatever it is -- -- he's looking for.	24
{D Like } the scribes who did  the old documents, {D you know, } for churches and, # stu-, # -	22
{F Uh, } they're sort of like, {D well, } I want to say flies,	24
Yeah.	15
[ [ We, + {D Well, } we, ] + I've ] [ never, + never ]  listened.	5
Well, the oth-, the other instance I think of their inability to, to handle things, the cholera, # and # hepatitis epidemics now in, in Latin America.	24
Yeah.	15
do you think we are, setting a trend?	7
{C and } we came up one time when my father was visiting	24
{C and } there's  beaches	24
wh-, -	26
{C and }  the Peace Corps or something like that is probably useful [ as, + as ] that kind of a time.	9
# I # think we're very lucky because just my job sort of  builds in flexible schedules,	24
I imagine <child>.	21
{C and } that would be Spring and Fall.	24
# {C And, } {F uh. } # The thing about it, {D you know, }  now that I've [ fo-, + found, ] is that we get such good coverage on T V, or at least such, {A I don't know, }  attempted thoroughness -- -- of coverage, by the time you get  the TIME [ MAG-, + MAGAZINE, ] there's nothing in it you don't know.	24
I will not let them watch that.	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ {C And, } + {C and } ]  you ask them why they don't vote,	24
{C and } one of them [ crazy -- + -- crazy ] guys get a hold of it,	9
{D Well, } it was nice talking to you.	38
{D well }  in fact I got her when I moved out of the house also.	24
# <Throat_clearing>  Uh-huh.  #	15
{C so, } -	26
(( yeah )) ,	26
-- [ from, + from ] taxes # -	24
{C but } we still felt the thick blame for, what had gone on.	24
Yeah.	15
# That's right. #	36
-- and if they sit there and then there's nowhere for the air to go.	9
that's true.	36
-- excellent movie.	24
I bet that's a interesting job.	21
{F Um, } I like to sing.	24
and # -- -	26
they lose the ability to learn,	9
{C and } you might have a car, and  that kind of thing.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	4
[ We, + {F um, } we ] canoed up in Arkansas at the Buffalo River.	24
Just simply because that time isn't spent just doing things like  fishing	9
# No,	36
{F Uh, } did they make the movies after that	7
Okay.	15
[ {C And, } + {C and, }  ] to those that have never worked [ and had, + {D you know, } and have  ] stayed home with the kids, kind of does your heart good <laughter>.	9
Yeah,	15
{C and } Linda had told me they had the best mushroom soup	24
[ {C and } + {C but }  ] [ I, +  they ] keep score   [ and, + ] between themselves	24
Yeah,	36
Yeah.	15
# I don't either <laughter>. #	36
{D Well, } I will look [ and, + and ] see.	24
Right, #	15
Right.	15
He climbs into a box and ends up floating down this river	24
[ I, + I  ] don't particularly enjoy it.	24
{F Uh, } {C and } I like listening to that [ on, + on, ] {F uh, } -	24
# To another place,	22
It used to be [ that we were, th-, + that we were ]  trying to protect morality.	9
{C and } they had a big rainstorm come through there, part of the same thing we're getting now, I guess.	24
<Laughter>.	20
-- I will always remember, -	24
{C and then } there's, {F uh, } an old station	24
And, and, so, you know, I can go around and comparison shop and see if I can get a better negotiation on my own.	24
-- it was amazing to me.	24
[ {C and, } + {C and then, } ] course, when my children were growing up,  we always had a dog, and always said it was because the children wanted the pet --	24
Sometimes I wish we'd help them out instead of going all across the world, # and # helping some countries I never even heard of.	24
I'm sure it was worth it though.	9
I agree.	36
{F Oh, } yes	4
[ [ {C But } +   {E I mean, }  {C but } ] # -- + {C but } ] he's excused from that.	9
yeah.	15
{C but } I really would hope that they would come up.	24
# Yeah.  #	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C but }  ((   )) [ I, + I ] think my wife is sort of like you	24
A lot of shops [ are, + are ] operated by southeast Asians.	9
it's almost more fun really to rent movies.  {D You know, } just kind of stay at home, maybe.	9
He says yeah,	24
{F Oh, } {C so } you think it was fear that kept Iraq from -- -- using it.	22
I think they said forty-one had been shot out  of one church in the last year.	24
Yeah.	36
That just seemed to me to be [ a, + {F uh, } a ]  phenomenal, {F uh, } demonstration of restraint,	9
{C or } <laughter>, -	26
{C Because } he doesn't even charge me [ for, + for ] doing it	24
# {C And } # that's wha-, {D you know, } -	26
[ I, + I ] couldn't probably be bothered doing that -- -- every month,	24
no,	33
Yeah,	15
<lipsmack> Sucking the head	9
# {D Well, } [ it, +  {F uh, }  # there's no question  it ] does make a difference.	36
{C But } I have loved this car better than anything I've ever driven, because you can go on the road and get there	24
Oh.	15
<Laughter>.	20
you start [ at, + at, ] {F uh, } two and a half weeks or something like that,	24
I don't notice it, probably because I don-, -	24
{C and } they wouldn't even think of it	9
# Yeah. #	15
Right.	15
{C So, } we've always enjoyed camping.	24
{C But, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } most people I knew have gone and got their degree.	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C And } it got to, {D you know, } -	24
{F Um, } for myself, I'm personally against it,	24
<laughter> Yeah,	15
yeah.	15
{F Oh, } yeah.	4
[ We had, {F uh, } the first reunion, + {E or }  the first, {D you know, } major reunion ] was probably six or seven years ago.	24
I'm sure that if you, {D you know, } ran on a platform of, {D you know, } we're going to find the kids that are having trouble at home and we're going to take them out of the home. -	9
{D Like } -- -- they've been laying off a lot of people.	24
that would be neat.	9
{F Uh, } {C and } there's poppy seed type things.	24
Yeah.	15
[ Ours don't, + ours doesn't  ] start until, {F uh, } next week.	24
Of course, if somebody [ in, + in ]  China can make something for ten cents and we have to make it for ten dollars because we have  unions, {D well, } I don't know what's going to happen then.	24
Wow.	21
I heard it's a law that you're only allowed to have three layers of shingles.	24
Yes,	15
{C So } that's the number one thing we do, whether we fertilize or anything else, just because we got burned so badly before.	24
-- {C and } {D you know, } there's a big move,  especially in the industrial part in Texas right now of controlling the C F C -s -- -- that the big manufacturing companies are  producing into the air -- -- they're having to change the type of products they use --	24
{C and } they closed,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
It would be handy.	9
Why was, you know, why -- -	39
my mom's like  I am.	24
{C and } it has -	26
{C but } she doesn't like the food.	24
{F Oh, } okay.	15
{D Well, } if it's, -	26
# {F Uh, } # -- -- DANCES.  {F Uh, }  SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.	24
Yeah.	4
Yeah.	15
{C and } yet -- -- he supposedly, -	24
[ All plastic, + [ they ha-, + ] all plastic ] has to go into a recycling bin,  all cans have to be recycled, all newspapers has to be recycled. Because [ they're, + {F um, } <lipsmack> they're ] just running out of space and  landfills.	24
{C but } [ they do, + they do ] a lot of research	24
[ It, +  it's, ] -	26
{F Oh, } yeah,	15
{E I mean, } my thought has been, once the guy has been imprisoned, if he goes to jail forever or whatever, if he gets killed, it shouldn't make any difference to [ the, + {F uh, } the ] victim's family.	9
I do too,	36
{C And } Costner got best director.	24
[ [ [ my, + my, ] + my, ] + my ] main sport is baseball	24
# No,	33
Yeah.	15
{C So } [ it really wasn't, + it was ] weird because we had snow <laughter>.	24
[ [ D-, + do, ] + do ] you get cable?	7
{C but } still I drive a long ways.	24
{C and then } you'd be lighter in kilograms  than you were [ in + -- -- in ] pounds.	24
{C So } <laughter>. -	26
Yeah.	30
# if # I want to work in the flower beds, -	24
{D well, } most of most of the people  I talk to  are from Texas.	24
{C although } I do see this as [ a, + ] {F uh, } something that definitely needs to be taken care of.	9
I don't think the newer automobiles are as polluting, uh, frankly.	9
{C And } where was that at, near your, -	39
Right,	15
Right.	15
bu-, -	26
# Right. #	15
{C and, } [ I don't know, + you wouldn't know ] anything about a Texas governor <laughter>.	9
uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	4
{D Well, } dogs are real high maintenances,	9
{C and } we don't have an awful lot of expenses or  surprises when it comes -- -- the end of the month.	24
[ I, + I ] try to go out of my way [ to, + to ] plan things that he can do with the kids because, {A since I am home with them and so I get a lot of time with them, } he needs to have, {F um, } some time with them.	24
If you do not have the time to talk to yourself,  who are you going to talk to.	16
{C but, }  people are really concerned,	9
{C And, } {F uh, } we went with our daughter and son-in-law to visit his parents, who live there.	24
Right.	15
<Laughter> My wife always wonders about that	24
Yes.	36
[ it looks like, + it looks like ] it might be one of these seven or eight year run things. Where you kind of can spend your whole career on one show.	9
((   )) .	26
{D now, } me I'm like  I said seafood I'm, -	24
{F Um, } [ how, + how ] far do you usually [ end, + end ] up driving [ just, + ]	39
{C And, } {F uh, } I still remember that watching myself and my son	24
Right.	15
That's up there by Kentucky, isn't it?	7
What, -	26
# Right. #	15
<Laughter> I avoid them with all <laughter>,	24
What's that?	14
{C But, } -	26
[ Does, +  does ] that make sense to you?	7
we're, -	26
# Yeah. #	26
-- {C and } they just thoroughly, {D you know, }  enjoy that --	24
I haven't done, <noise> {F uh, } -	24
I have a wife and two children	24
I've never actually seen her in concert.	24
{C and } something that is infinite and just incomprehensible. -	9
{D You know, } [ {C an, } +  {C an, } ]   [ I, + I ] think that, {F um, } <<pause>> -	9
Uh-huh.	15
No,	32
# {C so } # -- -	26
Oh.	15
{C and then } we would turn the television off	24
Yeah	36
{C and } they're South Americans,	9
On our, {F uh, } public television,  they had a show at ten thirty that was a computer show.	24
<Laughter>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
[ [ I don't, + because I don't, ] + I don't ]  have any personal feelings about them	24
{F Oh, } do you have a favorite among all those that you have been to?	7
One thing I really hate, is they don't explain to the jurors, [ [ in a, + in a ] trial, + in a capital murder trial, ] or in cases of rape, or in different things that are so horrible, what it means when they sentence them to, {D you know, } -	9
{F Huh. }	15
Not all,	21
{C But } I know a lot of people have said that and then find out how tough it is	24
And child labor.	2
{C and } if you do that when do you do it	25
# Right. #	15
She loved them babies,	24
{C And } do [ they, + they ] just paper train it or something?	7
it's, -	26
[ {C But, } +  {C but, } ]  I'm not too sure when I put my property tax in, my car tax, my income tax, and these myriad of, {F uh, } -	24
what, -	26
Yeah,	36
{F Uh, } I didn't really perceive much [ of a, + of a ] problem with the school system.	24
Okay.	36
Uh-huh.	15
[ [ [ [ [   They're, + {F uh, } they're, ] + they're ] they, ] + they have, ] + I think they have ] the best facilities in the major leagues.	24
{F Oh, } Lord.	21
# {C so } I haven't, # -	26
{C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } they may not even discuss it,	9
{C so } she does it partly because of the money but partly for herself, too <noise>. # {D You know, } #	9
Yeah.	36
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } that's an old established,  {F uh, } restaurant.	24
{D Well, }  (( how it, )) -	26
you, too.	38
that, # -	26
{C and. } -	26
if you give up, then you can come live in our country	25
Yeah,	4
{C and, }  {F uh, }   {D well, } it had an excellent story line.	24
{C but } they spread out to cover more  area	24
Right.	11
She's actually at Bible College for this current year.	24
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } not being a teacher, as you are, {D you know, } [ I, +  I ]  was not quite as sympathetic [ as, +  {D you know, } as ] I probably would have been [ if, +  if ]  Kay were a teacher or something.	24
{C and } I haven't taken the time or effort  to learn what they are.	24
Yeah.	15
Central Standard Time is what they're doing it by.	24
Your list is growing,	9
That, {F uh, } -	26
[ {C but } I'm ge-, + {C and }  I'm getting ] much better at it	24
{F Um, }	26
{C And so } how do you relate as to whether  this particular armed robbery was [ a, + ] {D you know, } worth five years or twenty-five.	16
Uh-huh,	15
{C and } -- -- keep cool.	38
find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way we will be able to, {F uh, } do it.	9
{D Well, } I think that's important  for your budget to be realis-, -	9
Okay.	13
[ once, + once ] I was declared an alternate  and I was dismissed, we met with the judge, the two alternates did.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
I thought it had a weight.  #	24
[ [ a, + a, ] + the ] sides and the lines that were drawn are all confused as to whose good and whose bad	9
Yeah.	15
{C But } there are a  lot of Ranger fans around.	9
no	36
{C So, } [ it's like, + # it's # like,  ] {D say, } a person using vitamins, as opposed to, {F uh, } vitamin supplements as opposed to eating regular food.	9
It is,	36
{C and } it's such a personal challenge.	2
[ {D w-, } + {D well } ] it's random in the sense that you don't know when.	24
{D Well } that's a nice area.	24
I was raised in a big family,	24
yeah.	36
{E I mean }    there's plenty of things to talk about there.	9
{F Uh. }	26
I think it was on the best-seller list, though -- -- for a while.	24
Do you have any kids?	7
it's interesting country.	24
That's sad.	21
{C and } she came to our school twice a week.	24
{C and } in fact, {D well, }  I, -	26
{C and } I didn't.	24
{F Uh, }	15
{C and, so, } {D you know, } just the general theme of the whole movie was, {F um, } pretty, -	24
Yeah,	36
you've got that,	24
{C And } were leaving them  ((   ))  small children.	24
{C And } he would probably be flying, is what he would be doing.	24
{C but, } {F uh, } <sniffing>  I've found that I've had a lot of luck with them.	24
{C So } it's hard to tell how much of that rubs off on those who are struggling [ to r-, + to retain, ] {F uh, } clarity, {D say, } {F uh, } # {D ((you know })). #	24
# Exactly. #	36
# {C but } my, # {F um, } softball unit  here <laughter> is acting like he's dying of (( tramane ))  poison <laughter>.	24
Okay,	13
Have you been in that situation yet?	7
(( Okay )) .	38
if it's a policeman and he's working with, {F uh, } the public [ and he has a, + and has a ] gun in his holster [ or, + or ]  even, {D you know, } if it's a guy at McDonald's cooking a burger, I think, <throat_clearing> they're dangerous in either situation.	9
That's true.	36
It, {F um, } -	26
It surely is.	36
They come on both.	24
my immediate reaction is that it's some sort of strange phone message	24
{C And } it finally ended up that, {F uh, }  even though we had reached a verdict before we were allowed to give it, they settled the case.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } they're just not, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
[ they, + {C and } [ they, + there's ] ] nothing that they can do.	9
Yeah.	15
{C But } I think, -	26
{C But, }  {F uh, } what I found out, -	24
{E I mean, }   what would it take, -	26
the jeezer music as I call it.	22
{C And } some of   still has to be redone.	24
We just get right on the freeway and just go north.	24
I do turn that on.	24
they will, #	36
That's where I grew up <noise>.	24
-- <Lipsmack> {C and, } {F uh, } there really needs to be a bridge, some sort of transition -- -- for that.	9
#  (( You bet )) . #	21
No,	33
Yeah,	4
Yes.	15
{E I mean } crimes against property seem to outnumber crimes against life,	9
Yeah.	15
As far [ as the, + as the  ] trends?	31
{C and } it's supposed to burn off more calories -- -- at the same time.	24
[ {C but, } + {C but } ] it does pay.	24
One of the frustrations that I have with the way things have developed is that, {A and for some it's not a problem, } [ but there's more and more, + ] it's difficult for a family to make a living on one -- -- income.	9
{D Well, } now this is a little bit of relief, although they still have warnings all the time around here for, {D you know, } tornado season -- -- hurricanes and stuff,	24
{F Uh, }   they were behind as they headed into each quarter	24
{D like, } my husband really likes it thick	24
I don't know if that took or not,	24
I know, I've got a two year old and a four year old,	24
{C and, } {F uh, } {F uh, } I can't understand  why anyone would abandon this dog, though.	24
interestingly  some of the information I've been reading indicates that the amount of air pollution from, {F uh, } {F uh, } airplanes is extraordinary.	24
To have -	26
Right,	15
{C and } as long as you pay that amount you're okay.	24
Yeah.	15
{C and, } {D you know, } we're paying almost eight percent sales tax, right now.  Which seems to me nuts.	9
# Yeah,	36
maybe our phone company out here will get around to, offering something like that.	24
Yeah,	4
of course I try to follow my alma mater,	24
Oh.	15
That's true,	36
# {F Oh } my gosh,	21
# {C but } # they had a good time	24
{C But, }   I know that it's got to have a radio, it's got to have air conditioning, <laughter>,	24
I really do.	9
Yeah.	4
{C but } in Salisbury,  [ you woul-, +  that's all you would ] hear was, This is the Doors!, {D you know. }	24
Okay,	29
we just moved down [ in, + in  ] June.	24
{C And } he was, -	26
Oh, I bet it was.	21
# Uh-huh. #	15
{C But } I know, they do have counseling, and that they do give you a second chance,	24
{C but, }  it's real hard to work in the summers and  holidays and weekends when you have four children and a husband,	9
Yeah,	36
[ It's, + {F uh, } to high school kids, it's, ]  {F uh, } alternative learning --	24
Yes.	15
{D Well, } I tell you what, [ that's, + ] [ y-, + ] count your blessings because -- -- {F uh, } it really is good when someone can do some -- -- things to a car themselves.	9
Uh-huh.	15
-- just to pack the bearings,	11
Yeah,	36
<Laughter>  {C But, } {F uh, } [ those were, + those were ] okay,	24
Yes.	15
[ {C but, } + {C but } ] like you said there's issues here too.	24
It's kind of hard [ to, + to ] get an even keel on that.	9
{C but, } {D you know, } then you're kind of playing God <laughter> -- -- which is [ n-, + never ] a good thing to do.	9
[ they, + they ] lost several contracts	24
Okay.	15
that would be a good idea. #	21
# Yeah,	36
And, uh, in fact I married one of those people <Laughter>.	24
<Sniffing>.	20
{D well } let me think,	17
{C and } my daughter was in Girl Scouts until just about a year ago --	24
it's very successful for some of, those things,	24
{F Uh, }  I use them both here at work and at home.	24
{E I mean, } I may have screwed in a  little <laughter>, screw that looked like  it was falling out on the door or something	24
I do not quite go along with that,	24
It certainly does.	36
Yeah.	36
{C And } we call them mud bugs <laughter>.	24
it was very, very difficult.	24
Yeah.	4
Once you can get into the language, -	9
{C and } [ she was the, + {F uh, } she was in ] the junior Olympics or something	24
I would get on a bus any day by myself,	24
{C but, } {D you know, } [ if he had the preference, + {E I mean } [ his, + his ] preference ]  is, {F um, } blue jeans and a t-shirt,	24
that's right.	36
it was after, [ I w-, + I had ] already been hired.  {F Uh, }	24
{C and then } once they do get elected, they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised, {D you know, } beforehand.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Idi Amin was, {D you know, } in power for so long.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D well, } {D actually, } [ [ he, + he, ] + he ] was supposedly, {F um, } -	40
{C but } -- -- I don't know.	19
just plain # yogurt.	11
Yeah,	15
<Clinking> Yeah.	15
It is just a work bench and a gazillion tools.	24
[ What's, + what's ] your feeling about benefits?	31
You've got the holy rollers	9
{C but, } -	26
Huh.	15
It's all vegetarian,	24
Right.	15
{C Because } a marriage takes a lot of effort and concentration <laughter>	9
{D So, } -	26
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
{C but }  [ [ I, + I ] just, + {D you know, } sometimes I just ]  don't like everybody knowing everything about me, {D you know, }	24
{D well, } {D you know, } we, -	26
{C and, } {F um, } she was from Saint Louis,	24
# I # keep hearing about it.	24
All right.	36
And, and it seems like it's a lot more than the-, they need to know and be able to do than when we are the, when I had to go in t-, ki-, kindergarten.	9
{C And } even {D like, } {D you know, } two-thirds majority, {E I mean, } it's <laughter>, -	9
-- yeah,	15
<Laughter>.	20
{C and } I thi-, -	26
[ No, + no ] remorse whatsoever, {F huh. }	7
Uh-huh.	15
# What?  <laughter> #	12
Uh-huh.	15
That's good.	21
{D Well, } do you have any pets?	7
uh-huh. #	15
Policemen who are killed in the line of duty.   *[[ Between this utterance and B.70, there seem to be 3 slash units ]] They may or may not have been willfully intending to kill that policeman, but that family still has no provider.   *[[ See note above.  Also, this should probably end in a slash because B.72 starts with a coord. conjunct. and a subject ]] {C And } I s-, -	24
<Laughter>.	20
{D See } I'm in the manufacturing  ((   )) -	24
Acoustics, {F uh. }	30
{F Um, } in my room they go from eight weeks to nine months.	24
Sure.	21
How can it be bad?	39
{C and } [ even, + even ] though [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] do enjoy cars, I enjoy, {F um, } driving them,  I enjoy, {F uh, } riding in them and everything,  {C but, }  I can't see [ buying, + {E or }  paying ] more for a car than I would for a house, {D you know. }	24
{C And } Brando {D like } does a parody of the character he played in THE GODFATHER.	24
Yes	4
[ {C and, } + {C and }  ] my brother's still in it.	24
they probabl-, -	26
Yeah	15
{C So, } I guess what, -	26
{C and } this session is about to run out.	24
Right.	15
It happens a lot.	24
<Laughter> That always seems to happen when you rent them, {D you know } <laughter>.	9
{D Well, } {F uh, } I don't have strong  feelings about changes to be made in the, {F uh, } jury system, do you?	7
Sure.	11
{C and, } <inhaling> {F uh, } [ one of, +  one of ]  the men who was a, -	24
[ I think, + I, ] -	26
{C and } she really liked it.	24
{C and } it's for a hundred and thirty-four dollars.	24
so do I. #	36
Yeah,	15
{C And } I'm not convinced that any of them work a hundred percent.	24
Uh-huh.	15
he's from here --	24
{C and, } {F uh. } -	26
Oh.	15
Our community is, {F uh, }  just starting to get organized about it.	24
Huh-uh.	36
What is your most recent, -	39
{F Uh, } probably the favorite instrument  would be, {F uh, } the violin.	24
I don't know where.	24
{D You know, } {E I mean, } that is a seasoning.	24
{C but } in the last ten years [ I've, + ] {F uh, } my car doesn't go to a shop, {D you know, }	24
<Laughter>.	20
{D Well, } not only just health  insurance, {E I mean } for the whole benefit of the company.	40
{C But } yet {D you know, } [ as, + as ] the parallel Russia is that Saddam Hussein is using the chemical warfare -- -- on his own people.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
[ Ho-, + how ] many kids do you have?	39
I think that it went up a thousand percent on most, -	24
{C And } I thought, no,	24
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] companies can  purchase this list	24
Uh-huh,	15
Mine's pretty limited to my little, {F uh, } porch plants <laughter>.	24
-- {C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } [ they wash, + when they open ] up the dam and let out water, they wash down the fish	24
it would be more work for the jury,	9
{C So } the next year when she, {D you know, } weeded them out -- -- so they wouldn't be as thick, [ then + ] she'd give me some of the bulbs.	24
{C And } the topics are interesting, {F uh, }	24
Yeah	15
{D Well, } {F uh, } just briefly.	24
{C or, } -	26
{F Um, } {D you know, } in the winter I wear sweaters,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
[ What, + what ] brought about the fading of the paint?	39
[ N-, + Nebraska  ] <laughter>.	30
# {E I # mean, } we, -	26
they learn how many centimeters are in an inch	22
{D Well } what about,  {F uh, } -	26
Our friends live like an hour outside of England, like Ash, around there.	24
the poor got poorer,	24
<Laughter> That's how I am too.	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C And then } the, -	26
That's right.	21
one of the news stations.  {A I couldn't even tell you which one I watched. But } they had on there, where [ the, +  the ] output from the United States was basically from smaller businesses rather than the larger ones are exporting.	24
{C And } I guess I'm getting [ old, + older,  ]	24
That's a lot.	9
# Uh-huh. #	15
{C But } [ the other one, + the first one ] I got he doesn't want anything to do with outside unless you're there.	24
{C and } I'm just still real sore.	24
{C But } [ I got it when, + I got it when ]  the eighty-eights first came out,	24
[ we, + {C and } we ] pay it sort of glancing nod.	24
Not that much.	5
{F Um, } I had a friend who had fixed some, {F uh, } [ chili, + buffalo chili ] [ and, + ]  about a week before went to see the movie.	24
I watch the national news.	24
A-, -	26
{D So, } yeah,	15
It's one of the few times I wanted more news than. -	24
Uh-huh.	15
have you had any former Suzuki students?	7
Oh.	15
{C So, } {F uh, } it's at -- -	26
I know they were considering it.	24
Fortunately, in his case, the death penalty was revoked	24
yeah.	26
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	15
{C And, }  {F uh, } # usually if you # can find somebody, -	26
He's really caught on	24
That would be interesting because [ [ [ I am, + {D actually, } {F um, } {F um, } I'm, ] + I'm ] + I'm ] Jewish	24
[ I was, + I was ] impressed by them.	24
{F Oh, } don't you hate that?	12
<laughter> don't have a job	24
{C and } it's kind of scary because the air is something we take for granted --	9
he's a record collector   and a Hot Wheels collector.	24
{F Oh, } I know it has to be.	36
[  I, + I, ] felt that it certainly was,	24
{C And, } {F uh, } hanging in the back of my mind is always the knowledge that I tend to drive cars for about ten years and a hundred fifty to two hundred thousand miles.	24
# {C So } # they should be programs set up by the government that could utilize those forms in different areas <swallowing>.	9
<Laughter>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
I know,	36
{D You know, } {C and } you look at our society,   almost everyone out on the street that  has been in prison, has been in prison  three or four times.	9
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
# {D Now, } # have you ever been to a professional football game?	7
{C And } it's not that he can't do it,	9
Right.	15
{C and, } that is one of the things  that they really stressed doing, {D you know, }	24
that's right.	21
{C And } yet so many of the citizens  are [ the +  {F uh, } the ] Lebanese. Who were hoping this would evolve  into a war against Israel. And {F uh, } trying to connect  with Israel all that time	9
I'm not either.	24
{C so } # -- -- he's an indoor cat,	24
{D You know, } she'll forget about the T V completely.	24
# How much # did it cost you for the paint for the outside?	39
Yeah,	4
Uh-huh.	15
Kind of like the cowboys,  {F huh. }	7
Yeah,	36
{F Oh, } okay,	29
-- yeah,	36
Right.	15
# Wow.  #	21
Yeah,	4
<Laughter>  Hour and ten minutes?	14
{C And then } out of that percentage, only so many can get their degree.	24
{C and then } you'll  have to give me a call on gardening <laughter>.	18
It's funny how many names have been used, {F uh, } all over the country.	9
{F Uh, } he does a lot of local stuff there  in San Antonio	24
you're at school.	9
[ {C But, } + # {C but } # -- ] -- really, [ [ the, + th-, ] + on the ] public T V, {D you know, } MACNEIL LEHRER -- -- [ is one, + is an ] hour's program that I always, -	24
{C But, } {F uh, } gee,	21
{C and } my husband dragged me to it.	24
Yeah,	15
# He  is,	9
basically my views, I guess they tend to be more economically oriented -- -- in that [ I just, + ] {D you know, } they come out with these figures that it costs fifty thousand dollars, taxpayer dollars a year to keep someone alive in jail -- -- when they're going to be there for life, they're never going to be rehabilitated.	24
At least  I always did  [ but + ] although {D actually, } <breathing> [ my, + I ] like the  mountains.	24
-- {F uh, } no problem at all.	24
<Throat_clearing>.	20
(( That's a big plus )) .	21
[ E-, + exactly. ]	36
I do a lot of work down in Waco,	24
{C So } he listens to New Wave	22
{F Um, } if we didn't give it we wouldn't go to Romania.	9
there have been several things that have happened where I felt like  if I had been involved in it I would have had [ to, + to ]  go along [ with, + with ] that being the punishment given [ to, + to ] the people.	24
How's his karate?	39
Yeah.	15
right.	15
Right.	15
of course it was back [ in the, + in the ] fifties	24
{C but } I just haven't, {F uh, } [ seen it, + ] {D you know, } watched it since.	24
{D You know, } isn't that funny, {F uh, } because the same thing happened to us, except I was twelve.	24
{C and then, } what you can get out here, in, -	13
{D Well, } I like Tia's better than I do El Chico's or El Fenix.	24
{D Well, } it's good talking to you.	38
Uh-huh,	15
They just did an excellent job.	9
Do you have children?	7
# {F Oh, } yeah. #	15
Yeah.	4
The housing is cheaper,	24
{D you know, } [ we're, + we're ] now collaborating.	24
Yeah	15
[ it's, + it's ] before.	24
Right or wrong?	7
had to get out to do something.	24
{C So } the houses actually on our  street [ are a little bit, +  they're kind of gone a little bit ] nicer.	24
{C But, } {F uh, } for a while there latch hook rugs were a real big, {F uh, } hobby.	24
{C but } -- -- came back with a little tan,	24
{C and } -- -- I think that's the one night that we really try to watch television.	24
Right.	36
I read an awful lot of,  {F uh, } periodicals and, {F uh, } {D you know, } almost what you call reference books.	24
{F Uh, } {C but } many times, {F uh, } <sigh> {D you know, } [ [ the, + the  local, ] + {F uh, } the local ] news kind of suffers, {D you know. }	9
Yeah.	15
I do too,	36
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
You have a [ very, + {F um, } very, ] -	9
Okay.	13
-- # {C but } # [ the, + ] {F uh, } <noise>  [ what, + what ] trees [ were, + were ] there when we moved in, {F uh, } {F uh, } [ were, + ] had been put in by the  developer when he built the house,	24
Uh-huh.	26
{C But } [ [ he, + {F uh, } he ] talks about, ] + {F uh, } he talks about ] a lot of different topics	24
# Yeah,	15
Yeah,	36
Right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
It was real nice,	24
{F Um, } I have to be at work [ [ at,  + at   X hour, ] +  {D you know, } [ [ at just, +  at, ] + at ] a certain ] hour	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } it has nothing <laughter>.	24
They're very expensive.	9
<laughter> {C so. } -	26
{C and } I had never heard of such thing,	24
{C But, }  {F uh, } [ I, + I ] don't know	19
-- {C and then } that way they can get their burgers and fries	24
# Yeah. #	15
[  It's, + it's ] been a while now <laughter>.	24
{C and } I think the, -	9
{D Well } didn't Kansas City put up  quite a bit of money for their -- -- pitching  (( staff )) .	7
yeah,	26
{C And } I'm very handy	24
{F Oh, } I know that there's several people I've talked to that really have a problem with it	24
Yeah,	36
Oh, we've got a, uh, an older Delta Eighty-Eight,	24
my wife's a registered nurse,	24
{D Well, } I don't know if I have a favorite -- -- {F uh, } religious author.	24
It's a little high,	24
Yeah.	15
# {C And, }  # -	26
They've got [ two, + the two ]  Johnson brothers	24
I don't know if you have an I R A or, {F uh, } {D you know, } -	8
We've,  {F uh, } -	26
{C and } we'll go [ and, + and ] just do what we want to do and then leave.	24
It's, {F uh, } supposed to be candy.	24
{E I mean } it seems like  ever-, -	9
Huh.	15
What's that?	14
I really do.	24
no,	32
I could watch YOGI BEAR, {D you know, }	24
{C And } I've enjoyed talking to you.	38
{C And } they have, {D you know, } pink linen napkins for their dinners. And, <sigh> a well equipped library.	24
If it's paper it will probably shred.	9
it is.	24
{C so } they're very nautical, too <laughter>.	24
{C But } a lot women (( die or shop ))  at Foley's	9
{F Um } <lipsmack>, Yeah.	26
{C but } [ I'm, + I ] have just found me an instructor to get started again,	24
{F Oh, } they're all, -	26
Huh-uh.	36
{F Huh. }	15
{F Uh, } [ I think, + I think ] the unwritten rule is,  {D yeah, } expect it	24
I agree <breathing>.	36
<Laughter>.	20
{F Oh, } really?	12
{C and then } I have [ a, + a ] Kawasaki motorcycle. Which is, {D actually, } [ the, + ] usually my preferred mode of transportation if I can take it and it's not raining.	24
Oh.	29
[ He, +  he's ]  very conscious [ of, +  of ] passive smoking	24
{C and so } I'll be in a suit	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
{F Uh, } I don't cook a lot {D actually. }	24
# All right. #	21
{F Ah. }	15
You're off of the main road, you said?	8
And have you had experience with cars other than the ones you have?	7
this is not one that you want to do that with.	25
I'm kind of into it.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C or, }  {F uh, } # -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } [ it, + it  ] was my sister's who, -	24
{C but } one of the things that bothers me is the credit information, {F uh, } situation, [ that you, + {F uh, } that you ] find yourself almost compromised into giving if you want any [ s-, + sort ] of credit, [ e-, + extensive ] checks [ and, + and ] things of that nature.	9
{F Uh, } that's neat.	21
[ {C and, } +  {C and } ] if you have it great,	24
{C and } I liked him.	24
<Noise>.	20
# it really is. #	24
That sounds really good.	21
{C and } they make sure that if they want to go to church, there's a bus there.	24
{C but } if it cost me twenty dollars, {D you know, } -	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } that was a real eye opener.	24
{D Well, } I guess we've sort of run dry a little bit.	9
Just to pack the bearings?	8
Yeah,	4
-- {C and } he was [ a, +  a ]  poor Frenchman who had grown up [ on the, +  on the ] streets and sort of pulled himself up by his bootstraps  and claimed to be a composer,	24
{D Well, } [ the way I, + the way I ] see it, is, -	9
I like because [ [ they, + they're, ] + even if they're ] crowded, they're fast service, {D you know -- }	24
"{C and, } {F uh, } I thing so, because they've been making these  four cylinder and six cylinder engines for a while   *[[ spelling - ""think""? ]]"	9
# Huh.  #	15
{C And } I was thinking in the course of talking to him about it, how, {F uh, } in World War Two, the personalties of Stalin, Hitler and Churchill more or less defined the war	24
[ that's, + that's ] possible.	24
{C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } I have different teachers, # here	24
I said, Yes, we may leave that.	24
at the same time, you have to decide what is important about the school,	9
{C and then } <laughter> winter got here	24
He feels more ethically about it.	24
Sixteen is the magic number for us.	24
{E I mean } [ these, +  these ] types of internal things go on # all over the world all the time. #	9
Those are the two I like the best.	24
Uh-huh.	36
Heavenly?	14
Yeah,	15
[ what's that, + what's that ] state north of us,	1
that's [ kind of, + kind of ] wild.	9
{C and } [ [ I know people, + I do, ] + {F uh, } I do ] work in language processing,	24
it wasn't really pollution, just the steamy weather #<laughter>.#	24
{C and } there's probably  thousands of holes in that theory,	9
{F Uh, } [ {C and, } + {C and } ] I might, -	26
You're probably right.	40
{C and } we have been married ten plus years	24
-- # [ Se- # + late sixties, ] seventies, {F uh } --	3
{E I mean, } [ [ I'm, + I'm, ] + I ] can understand baseball, {D you know, }	24
Uh-huh.	36
thanks.	38
He has got, {D like } a six handicap.	24
it's once you get out of that habit -- -- [ you just don't, + you don't ] get back into it.	9
Course we have two little kids that are two and three years old <laughter>.	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C because } I've lived here, {D you know, } since, {D well, } I was born and raised here,	24
# Yeah,	15
<Laughter>  <throat_clearing>.  {F Uh, } was a what, -	26
Yeah,	36
{D Well, } the jury that sentenced him, sentenced him to death --	24
I hate having to water so much around here -- -- {D you know, }	24
{C So. } -	26
{D Well } you see all that on T V	24
{C but, }  {F um, } I go to the Orioles since they're here,	24
Oh.	15
{C But, } {F uh, } -	26
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } {D basically, } {F uh, }  did you want to go first, then?	18
it was something like discuss pollution.	24
{F Uh, } yeah,	15
Our community doesn't really have any organized recycling drive.	24
Right.	36
And then freeze them	2
# {F Oh, } yeah. #	15
{F Oh, } do you?	12
I know this year we took our Christmas tree -	24
{C And } every time I wanted  one I have to go outside and just take one.   One at a time.	24
He, -	26
Now this is not just a state law,	24
I see.	21
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yes.	15
{D So } it'd be interesting for the people that look at this signal <laughter> {E I mean, } because there's a lot of background noise that, {D you know, } people can hear.	9
Uh-huh.	15
I don't know what, they're called.	24
uh-huh.	15
{F Um. }	26
{D Well, } {F um, } do a lot of people take advantage of it?	7
Yeah,	15
Exactly.	36
{C and, } -	26
# Right.	15
# {C And } # sometimes, if I am using, {D like, } regular mayonnaise, to spice it up a little bit -- -- {F uh, } I will use a little bit of mustard with it.	24
[ He, + {D actually, } he ] just went to the vet yesterday to get his shots and everything,	24
{D Well, } [ I haven't had a chance, + I haven't got a chance ] to look at them yet.	24
{C So } it took him about two and  a half years,	24
uh-huh.	15
I certainly didn't mark off anything to get this one.	24
Yeah,	4
not really.	24
it's, -	26
# {C and } # he'll be over there until July first setting up some kind of computers for them.	24
# Yeah. #	15
Yeah.	15
{C or, } -	26
{C and } I'm not too welcome around,	24
you'd s-, {D you know, } -	26
I think that, like you said, television?	9
-- {C and } the nice thing about it too is,  I knew that I wanted to get into business and that their [ business, + College of Business, ]  was accredited	24
{F Oh, } that'd be go-, -	26
Holy cow!	21
<laughter>  The Dallas Cowboys.	24
{C And, so, } [ with, + {D you know, } with ]  the I B M what would happen is, {F uh, } since the software that I had was, it was basically, {D you know, }  you only see part of the page.	24
[ {C And then, } + {C and then } ] of course today it's supposed to be all the other way.	9
this is Lisa.	6
[ [ A-, + a-, ] + # as ] soon as we wind up, {F uh, } {F uh, } {D you know, } for, -	9
{C or } it can be,	26
[ I, +  I ] think that's very important.	9
Uh-huh.	4
<<Very faint>> Yeah.	15
I am so sorry to keep you on hold.	41
{C So, } the country [ of, + of ] Kuwait really doesn't make just a whole lot of sense except that it is an excepted place, {D you know } --	9
All right.	13
yeah.	15
{C And } in the car, -	26
That'd be my self defense.	24
{C and } [ [ it, + it's sometimes a very, ] + [ it, + it's ] ] a very hard juggling act.	9
probably not.	36
You can't make parents be parents <laughter>.	9
Oh.	15
Yeah.	15
Corrode.	2
-- # {C And so, } # -	26
Right.	15
What?	39
{C but } I think it's higher than usual, isn't it? Yeah,	7
My daughter is, {F uh, } a twirling champion --	24
{C but } no one is just welcome to  come by my house.	24
Yeah.	15
most people have relocated to the Washington area, <laughter> {D you know. }	24
{F Oh, } me either.	24
Uh-huh.	15
what do you think about it?	31
I was just reading an article, {F uh, } that there were nineteen thousand properties available in Texas, {F uh, } for sale by the [ Reso-, + Resolution Trust ] [ Com-, + Corporation? ]	7
{F Oh, } okay.	29
Yeah,	15
-- {C and } it has a huge strong mouth,	24
Yeah.	15
{F Uh, } the, -	26
{F uh, } of course, they're burning gasoline, of course.	24
{C so } we'll go in.	24
# Local you mean? #	30
Uh-huh.	15
<Laughter>.	20
It just went through	24
Yeah.	15
-- {C and } I use [ a, + one of those ] black poker hoses that actually oozes water every where --	24
{C So, }   when I heard that Jack  was going to do this, I called him and asked for an <meow> application where I could participate -- -- in this.	24
I realize that.  {E I mean, } to go to these movies and expect them to be, {D you know, }  other than [ just, +  just ] good entertainment -- -- kind of thing.	9
{C And then } one night we were camping	24
{C but } T I is up there,	24
What have you <laughter> seen recently?  <laughter>.	39
was it small enough that you could just hold it?	7
{D Well } they feel [ invu-, + invulnerable ]  to, {F uh, } any wrath	9
Uh-huh.	15
I see.	29
-- {C so, } [  we're, + we ] take trips pretty often.	24
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C then ] } we have, {F uh, } staff secretaries and administrative assistants,	24
-- just about -	26
Right.	38
that's the way a lot of my friends did it	24
{C So } I, don't know.	19
{F Oh, } I guess, {F uh, } this is  [ a, +  a ] topic  near and dear to my heart, since I [ am a, + am a ] healthy eater,	24
Yeah.	15
<<Very faint>> {F Huh. }	15
{C and, } -	26
{C and } she keeps it year round.	24
Yeah,	15
again you can read it [ in, + {F uh, } in ] a lot less than ten minutes.	9
[ [ I made a, + I made a   fourth bedroom out of, {F uh, } ] + [ a + ] made a fourth bedroom ] [ out of  one of our, + out of our ] living room and  then added [ a, + ] {F uh, } what we call a sunroom -- -- to get the, {D you know, } -	24
{C and } it may be eight pages long.	24
-- {C and, } {F uh, } I was brought up  the same way,	24
{F Um, } I don't want any of those ones that will  ((   ))  up the kids,	24
[ I, + I ] think [ that what he, + he reported what he ] saw --	9
<Laughter>.	20
{D You know, } it's like, -	9
my daughter had [ a, + (( {D like } a ] ))  little goldfish, [ a + about ] a year or two ago	24
{C and, } {F uh. } -	26
{C Because } I know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still.	24
{E I mean } I find, -	26
-- that doesn't seem to cost a whole lot of money.	9
yeah.	36
{C And, }  {F um, } hot dogs {D like } start at a dollar fifty <laughter>.	24
Yeah.	15
{C so } I've enjoyed it,	24
[ I haven't, + I haven't ] personally done that,	24
My parents do not have a whole lot of money # to put into it. #	24
yeah,	36
You and me both.	24
{F Uh. }	26
Okay.	29
{D Well, } [ what, + what's ] frightening is a parent to see things [ that, + that ] you don't really don't understand.	24
{F Uh, } yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
We don't get a paper	24
All right.	38
{C And, } {F uh, } it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have, {F uh, } {D like, } {F uh, } {F uh, } support quota --	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I don't remember a lot about anything at that time in my life very much in, great detail.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
Like you said before,  ((   ))	24
{D Well, } that's nice.	21
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } I think even in the elections,  they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not,	9
{F Oh, } [ that, + that's ] a remarkable number.	21
Uh-huh.	15
I have a gas card  and a Visa card.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } finally a guy gets up there and blasts a home run	24
{F Um, } {C and, } -	26
{C And then } I would [ provide, + {F uh, } use ] the money that we've paying them to, {F uh, } provide some special help in training and particularly, {F uh, } mentor teachers -- -- to work with the beginning teachers and the teachers who may have been at it a long time <laughter>  but have been making the same mistakes for a long # time <laughter>. #	24
We had [ s-, + a few ] showers,  but,  {F uh, } nothing that really got in the way with anything and just very brief ones	24
{D Well, } my mother doesn't think they have any flavor the way I cook them <laughter>.	24
{C And } we have a gourmet friend that can't stand fish	24
when you rent a car,  you get that	24
{C and } I just picked it up off the street	24
{D Well, } yeah,	4
<Throat_clearing>  In fact, I was watching WILD WILD WEST last night	24
[ {C and, } +  {C and then } ] later, {A this was actually funny, }  my brother and I were picked up by the police for questioning because this fellow had bought [ a, + a  ] new car	24
Alrighty.	38
[ [ I, +  I've, ] + I have, ] {F uh, } a low tolerance for [ that kind of, + {F uh, } that kind of ] person.	24
Yes.	15
She has two bedrooms, [ and a, + and a -- ] -- separate living area.	24
That's true.	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C and, } {F uh, } as hard as they  try to get these public transit things going I have never seen nor heard of one that really got of the ground. Or that accomplish what they  set out [ to com-, +  to accomplish. ]	9
We had the Visiting Nurses program --	24
-- {C and } there isn't really a lot of T V watching.	24
Bye.	38
Yeah,	36
Yeah,	36
yet, your absolutely right.	9
Yeah.	15
Yes,	36
-- {C and, } {F uh, } there's a lots of little things you can get to cut out.	24
right.	15
{C so } let's send you another credit card	25
{F Um, } <noise> the ones that look like brick houses <laughter>?	14
# Yeah. #	15
He probably just went right down into a tunnel.	9
Uh-huh.	15
That's right.	36
I was approached	24
{D well, } {E I mean, } with Detroit, {E I mean, } they can get away with one guy like that.	24
{D Well, } that's good.	21
Uh-huh.	15
# {C but } if, [ it + you ] do not # have to put them in child care, [ that's, + that's ] an ideal situation for you, is to stay with them	9
{C And } the, -	26
{C but, } Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } really.	12
"Whether or not they get it is hard to say <noise> <<sounds like a chair is drug across the floor>>.   *[[ spelling:  ""dragged"", not ""drug"" in this case ]]"	24
{C and then } he tells you how to invest that money in order to, {F uh, } {D you know, } be wealthier. {F Uh, }	24
{D Well, } [ that, + that ] just seems to be a person who just [ [ doesn't care about much of anything around, [ sort of, + {D you know, } doesn't, + doesn't, ] + ] sort of, ] likes rights probably, but doesn't like [ respon-, + responsibilities. ]	9
<Laughter>.	20
--  {C and, } {D you know, } [ when, + when ] we dine out we go to {D like } medium priced restaurants.	24
<Breathing>.	20
{D You know, } my kids aren't getting that.	24
Yeah.	4
Yeah,	15
Yeah,	36
-- {C and, } -	26
# Yes.  #	15
Yeah.	15
{C But } you can't say then, {D well, } public schools  [ are, + are ] not as good.	9
uh-huh.	15
{C so, } I, -	26
{C And } one of [ the, +  {F uh, } the, ]  {F um, } <lipsmack> vendors had cakes.   All sorts of wonderful cakes.  {F Uh, }  [ they, + ] fresh  [ str-, + strawberry ] cheesecake now [ and, +  and ] so  on.	24
No	32
Yeah,	15
two,	24
I mean, I can still to this day taste that water.	24
Uh-huh.	4
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
{F Oh, } that would be good.	9
Right.	15
[ I, +  I've ] always liked that.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } my husband and I like getting the salads or the lighter meals --	24
Sure.	15
I don't own a shotgun,	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	4
Uh-huh,	15
{D you know, } of course, [ it's a go-, + it's ] for the government	24
[ [ [ It's,  + I, ]  + I, ] + it's, ]   because I think they had a good try there when they started with us in the elementary schools, trying to, <breathing>  {D you know, } get that in our minds, so that we could ch-, {E I mean }	9
{C and } [ I, + I ] want to believe it's all okay.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } you did?	12
then I'm home to pick her up.	24
{C but } {E I mean, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } I'm one of those rare left-handed golfers.	24
I have, -	26
Yeah,	26
we were talking one day	24
That's true.	36
{C And } you get ticketed if you don't do it right.	9
That was my thing for a while.	24
{C so, } it was, {F uh, } a good thing that, <laughter> it wasn't a total waste of time  to have a hung jury on a case that trivial.	9
{C But, }  I, -	26
[ it's, + it's ] wrong,	9
{D you know, } you hear this guitar,	24
I am glad I raised guys.	24
[ {C and, } + {D you know, } {C because } ] there were all different, organizations to do.	24
I, {F uh, } fear for the Russians from what  I read, {D you know, }	24
[ it, + it's,  ] -	26
[ # Does, + does ] it just want to sniff around? #	7
<laughter> I guess so <laughter>.	36
{C and }  things do happen severely a few times a  year,	9
[ I was, + I was ] very against our involvement so  quickly.	24
Yeah.	4
{C and so } those papers really, -	24
<laughter> I can't believe, {D you know, } I've got, {F uh, } five, {F uh, } megabytes on this one now --	24
{F Oh, } I definitely believe in capital -- -- punishment.	24
Yeah.	36
{D well, } I've never tried any other kinds of painting besides on a surface like the house -- -- like to paint a picture or anything.	24
[ In, + in ] the light of what has been happening lately with the doctors that I know and lawyers and whatnot, I think national health insurance is a way to throw a lot of money at a very small problem.	9
{C So, } I am looking at changing things a little bit.	24
Okay.	15
you need a house, I guess, to go through all of that.	9
Right.	15
yeah,	26
With all of you living so close together.	22
I'm trying to think.	19
{F Oh, } really.	15
{C or, } {D you know. } -	26
{C and } [ we, + {D like } here we ] use the P C -s to do that.	24
we threw it way last year <laughter>.	24
{C and } it's kind of like we're the first to do it.	9
If they chose not to, that's acceptable.	9
{C and } they slip it to them.	24
# It just gets deposited.	24
I, {F uh, } have, {F uh, } a bread recipe that is real easy that everyone always really does like. That, {F uh, } doesn't require kneading the dough.	24
# yeah,	15
{C But, } {F um, } {F oh, } I guess,  [ [ [ I, + I ]  just, + {D you know, } I always, ] + I have always ] tried to sew	24
Eat at six,  yeah.	30
It's pretty cool	9
{D Well, } [ we, + we ] bought [ the extended, +  [ the + the ] extension ] -- -- {C and, }  {F uh, } at the time we bought it it was like, {D you know, } {A I don't know, } four hundred and twenty-five dollars or something extra.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } no	33
How come?	39
Yeah.	15
which this is on a highway, too.	24
Ooh.	21
{F Oh, } {C so } they just use the money for something else besides your insurance policy?	7
{C so } -- -- it's close to getting, {F uh, }  one T V per person they say <laughter>.	24
Yeah.	15
{C And, } {F uh, }  she said [ [ tha-, +  that, ] +  that, ] {F uh, } {D you know, } he used to always keep his guns locked up and  everything like that	24
{C So } you live in Garland then.	8
{C and } I just went home	24
before moving to Wisconsin lived across from where they were, {F um, } gravel pits -- -- and also where they were making tar,	24
Did you know that, {D like, } something like fifty percent of the world's landfills is {D like } [ paper? + Filled with paper. ]	7
Uh-huh,	15
I've, # never # been randomly <noise>  drug tested.	24
no	33
They have [ little, + little, ] teeny-weeny news, breaks, {D you know. }	9
Uh-huh.	15
so we're going to do that with our daughter too.	24
{C but } the thing is he was in school all day, in second grade,	24
Right.	15
{C but } he's always stayed right here -- -- {D you know, }	24
no,	33
{C and } we've got our bug light	24
Huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
You are talking about P O W -s -- -- or -- -- missing in actions?	7
[ [ I, + I ] think # -- + -- I think ]  [ people [ would be, +  would get ]  [ very, + very, ] + {D you know, } they'd be  very ] careful about how they bought stuff.	9
{C so } it's like  how can you, -	16
[ {C So, } + {C but } ] [ it's, a, + it's ] just, {D you know, }	26
Yeah.	15
I don't know if you get SOUTHERN LIVING,	8
{C And } she told me about a private one.	24
# Yea-, #	15
{C So, } -	26
No kidding.	21
Right,	15
I just can't afford them here.	24
I went, a hundred kilometers. {D You know. }	25
{D Well, } [ I, + {F uh, } I ] guess because I work quite a bit with lawyers, {A I'm not a lawyer, } {F uh, } that I find a lot of things are so specialized that I'm not sure,	24
{C but } [ I, + it's ] just that they are both very long -- -- {F uh, } movies,	24
Uh-huh.	15
# Yeah.	36
[ [ If, + if, ] + if ] you feel it's an invasion of privacy, [ you've, + you've ] probably got something you're trying to hide <laughter>.	9
With the plastic.	2
Nod your head and smile at them.	22
I know they [ put, + {F uh, } put ] them in jail sometimes, I guess. {F Uh, }	24
I can't think of it.	24
We had, {F uh, } Pine Knob -- -- {D you know, } to go skiing -- -- and stuff.	24
Yeah	15
{D Well, } I could certainly, personally stand seeing them go to [ a, + a ] standardized compensatory time -- -- for overtime.	9
that's true.	36
{C and } I kept saying, {D Well, } I want to take a few of these, and I want to take these, and I want to take these.	24
# {C And } # how they deal with life itself <sniffing>.	24
{C because, } it seems that there -	26
they're starting [ to, + to ] cut back.  Especially start-ups.	9
Uh-huh.	15
<talking> {F Huh. }	26
Yeah,	15
she, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{F Huh, } let's see.	17
{D Well, } there's a lot of fat in meat.	24
{C or } I just enjoy, {F uh, } {D you know, } the newspaper magazine.	24
Right.	15
it's making [ that, + that ] connection especially with the mechanical parts of it.	24
{C and, } -	26
{D you know, } they, -	24
{E I mean } they were saying that of us, that we're the North Americans and they're Americans,	9
{C So, } {D you know, } -	26
{C so } -	26
you want to go ahead and tell me your favorite team, or  who you think will be doing well this year.	18
<Laughter> Exactly.	36
{F Uh, } -	26
They risk their lives every day.	9
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	15
when we were young everything was great because we all went to class together,	24
{C And } {C so } that's kind of stunt its growth for just a while until we get it back going again.	24
I use a three iron off the tee -- -- because, I have more control over it.	24
{D you know } you're sweating,	9
that was one, {F uh, } Jay got to see <laughter> with a friend	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C and } sometimes it might be the picnic out back or something	22
{C but, }  I think the aerobics classes are even pretty reasonably priced, from what I've heard.	24
[ I, +  I ] do enjoy camping.	24
{F Oh } <laughter>.	15
Ranch style home, [ I  shou-, + <laughter> I would ] hate to  think that anybody thought, {F uh, } the lot we live on as a ranch.	24
{C and, } {F uh, } if I catch him I call him	24
That's right.	36
It's this house built [ on, + on ] a waterfall	24
{C and, } {F uh, } -	26
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
{C Because } I have heard that, {D you know, } you get locked into a routine then you are going to get to a point where you just stop developing.	24
My husband does at work just  to get cash out,	24
[ I don't think  that [ that's,  + that,  ] + I think that's ] more of a personal view of mine -- -- other than [ a, +  a ] yes, sir,  we should have drug testing because there's really a problem	24
{F Uh, } we are punishing someone for taking someone's life,	24
{E I mean, } [ [ if we were to, + if, ] + if ] something were to happen, I'm sure they would all of a sudden band together just [ for the sake of, + for the sake [ [ of, + {F uh, } of, ] + of ] ] unity against us or something -- -- [ [ if, + if, ] + if ] need be.	9
Yeah,	15
it was great.	24
{D well, } [ [ I, + I mean, ] + I think ] [ there's some people, + there, [ y-, + ] certainly are some things ] where you need infrastructure	9
he's really worked out well.	9
{D Well, } lots, right?	7
Yeah,	15
{C So. } I don't know. [ I, + I ] guess we're kind of in the same boat.	9
{C and } we have enough clouds that, {F uh, } there are other areas that would be better suited.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } it's the one that's on my father-in-law's computer.	24
I don't mind my taxes as much as my social security.	24
[ there is, + there's ] an awful lot of things set up, {D you know, } just [ any, + anything ] you want to do.	9
{F Um, } {F um. }	15
I've seen that for years,	24
[[[ {C a-, } + {C and, } ] + {C and, } ] + {C and } ] as far as, {F uh, } {D you know, } myself having any particular personal, {F uh, } knowledge or insight into politics or politicians, [ it, + I'm ] not terribly involved in it.	24
Uh-huh.	15
[  I, +  I've  ] just gone blank.	17
{C and, } # -	26
Yeah.	15
Brake pads are  (( disposable )) , {D you know, }	24
<Laughter> That makes it bad for getting out during a fire.	9
{C and } [ I can't even -- + -- I can't even ] grow an ivy.	24
{D Well, } you got any more?	7
That way there's no damage to the car or anything.	24
It's not too strenuous,	24
{C and,} most, -	26
[ {C So, } + {C and } ] we like our neighborhood.	24
It really doesn't,	36
Oh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C so } then he was found not guilty,	24
No,	36
Oh.	15
{C But } it took them a little while?	7
{C But } they were real good about replacing it.	24
Let's see <laughter>.	17
{F Oh, } he is going to build you a fence.	8
<Breathing>.	20
{C And } every  one of them have five or six kids.   {C And } most of them, <child_talking> {D you know, } have got kids <laughter>.	24
Yeah.	36
{C and, } [ I was, + I ] worked for [ the little, + the ] weekly newspaper there, [ the, + the ] Plymouth, {A {F oh } what was it called, } CRIER.	24
{D Well,  } [ [ [ I, +  I, ] + I ] think we did, + I think we did ] learn some lessons that [ we weren't, + {F uh, } we weren't ] prepared for,	9
I don't think it's a monetary thing.	9
Uh-huh.	15
<Laughter>.	20
{C so, } I've heard some stuff about them.	24
{F Oh } no,	27
{C and so } -- -- there was an awful lot of snow,	24
{C and } I, -	26
{C But } as far as the sentencing by the judge,  I would have to vote against that since there is a jury, because that's what the juries  are for is to make the decision.	24
Okay, {F uh, }	13
{C and } you had to take your  diskette to the P C to print something.	24
{C and } I get along with them very well	24
I don't believe in this career, you know, this career drive when, when they're small, because I think, -	9
it is.	36
-- either way they'll spell it.   Hoi Sin sauce.	24
{C and }  {D you know } it is like  Oahu,	24
{D Well, } I don't think that {F uh, } any of my relatives would really like to go there.	24
{C and } I said, {D okay, } I want to see a curriculum guide,  {D you know, }	24
{C And, } I like the idea that they have a, {F uh, } system where they allow you to, {F uh, } be retested if for, # some reason # there may have been a problem. # or something # did show up.	9
(( I know )) .	36
yeah,	36
{C because }  I lived right downtown, # Washington	24
Yeah.	15
# {D Wel-, } just # stick to that,	22
[ It's, + {F um, } it's ] just as long as you want to.	24
wouldn't that be something.	7
-- {C and, } {F uh, } from the time that we were tiny, she said, {D you know, } I want you to promise that you'll never put me in a rest home.	24
# Yeah. #	15
Yeah,	36
Yeah,	15
{F Oh. }	15
{D Well, } it's really lucky that you got away from that.	9
{C because } I think contraceptives are going to be more popular.	9
They went down almost fifty percent in this election # before they blew up # Ghandi. But, # simply because people were so # # concerned # about their inability [ that + [ to, + ] that ] their vote does not count any way. # And the # corruption of politics [ [ in, + in, ] + in ]  that s-s-situation there.	24
Okay.	29
Uh-huh.	15
{C So } it's not, {D you know, } -	26
you reduce the deficit,	9
# Uh-huh.  #	15
I sell sporting goods,  {F uh, } hunting related items,	24
Forty-two cents out of every dollar I make goes to the government,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And, } {F uh, } [ in the, +  in the ]  Dallas, {D you know, } Fort Worth city areas you don't see that.	24
{F Huh. }	15
{F Uh, }	26
# Or staying home. #	8
{F Oh, } {D actually, } that's true,	21
Yes.	4
# Uh-huh. #	15
Yeah.	15
[ It, + when ] I came on it was great because I had never had anything even close to [ what, + what ] they offered.	24
Uh-huh.	15
<Laughter> <breathing>  {F Um. }	15
-- {D you know. } -	26
{C but } that's our next thing <smack>.	24
{C so } it's fifty percent.	24
That's why I don't get to watch that much.	24
[ Have you seen, + {F uh, } [ h-, + + have ] you, {F uh, } ever heard ] of ALL THINGS CONSIDERED?	7
[ the, + the ] novelization of STAR WARS  was list-, -	24
{F Uh, } {D well } social security's going to go to way, I think	9
{C and } they were not.	24
It, at times, gets incredibly hot here.	24
{C but } I can't remember who it was about.	24
You're telling them that, {D hey, }  you might as well forget it, # {D you know. } #	9
Yeah.	15
{C and } get the recipe from them or whatever.	24
{C But } that was just a good football game.	24
{C so } [ I, + I ] kind of know how to do these things.	24
now I always plant trees in the fall.	24
[ [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] + {C and } ] the person that was raped or whatever doesn't, -	24
{C and, } {D you know, } you had to have a supply like, {F uh, } emergency supply on hand all the time -- -- during the hurricane season,	24
{C because, } {F um, } [ some of, + some of ] [ the, + the ] Peace Corps, {F uh, } that I knew of, did marry Peruvians, and have been back	24
{D So, } -	26
Some things are serious	9
I kind of agree with that.	36
{F Oh, } gosh,	21
{E I mean, } [ the-, + they're ] throwing more money at it now than ever before	9
He'd probably look pretty funny if we did that.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C so } # you don't have to # -- -- get out or anything.	24
Uh-huh.	15
What?	39
{C And } I like to watch 'em	24
Yeah.	15
have you ever been there?	7
{D You know, }  one of those hell family vacations.	24
Right.	15
In fact, that's where I've seen most of my movies, have been on video.	24
[ If, + if  ] its only walk the dog or something.	24
Right.	15
{F Oh, } that's great.	21
{D So } that's really not roughing it so much #	22
{C so } he has to dress,	24
{C And } plus, [ we like, + we both like ] to cook,	24
{C But } anyway, [ we've, + we've ] enjoyed that,	24
Uh-huh.	15
It takes that mixture of a very mature college student, # who # wants to do something and yet is willing to give the time, and the interest to the children.	24
{C And } I feel like  if there's a qualified woman to do the job and if she's good or better than a man then [ she sh-, + they should ] get the job with the same pay.	9
{F Uh, } {D well } [ I guess I, + I guess I'm ] probably a little more [ to, + toward ] the other direction.	24
[ [ It, + It ]  really is, + {F yeah, } it really is ] nice, {E I mean, } because it gives  you a wide variety of things you can call and talk, and find out about.	24
{E I mean } that insurance is high dollars.	24
{C and } where they're going <laughter> than I do beca-, -	24
In fact, {F uh, } <breathing> [ just a little over, + just a little less ] than a year ago, {F uh, } my mother <talking> went to be with the Lord,	24
[ [ I don't, + I haven't, ] + {E I mean, } I haven't, ] -	26
Yeah.	15
# {C And } I cannot imagine # being  able to do much of anything when they don't even come to school.	24
{C but } they look like different color ones,	24
uh-huh.	26
{C and } I ran on the treadmill and rode the bike	24
Right.	15
{D Well, } I guess if the police came out and saw him fire the gun, -	24
{D Well } that, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
-- {F uh, } I've been really pleased with its performance and  with the size	24
Yeah.	15
{C and, }  {F um, } I guess I had a crack in the block,	38
{C and, }  {F uh, } <throat_clearing> {D you know, } [ he, + he ] tried to appeal his conviction.  {F Uh, }	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } maybe a little more leisure time -- -- to do it.	9
[ he, +  he ] was, {F uh, } a great collector of everything,	24
Yeah,	15
{C and } he's contemplating <talking>. -	26
I liked to [ as a, + as a ] method of, {F uh, } entertainment and I, {F uh, } fellowship	24
{C But } when you first came out, you weren't real sure.	9
No,	33
(( {D see, } it have ))  been like nineteen sixty-seven or sixty-eight, {F um, }	24
{D Now } what can you do to stop that?	39
{C So, }  I felt more comfortable at, # that # place.	24
Right,	36
I'm trying, -	24
[ it, + it's ] hard to beat some of the, -	9
{D Well, } that's a nice way of putting it.	21
Uh-huh.	15
<throat_clearing> [ if + if ] you wanted to, {F uh, } {F uh, } really get into a hot issue, {F uh } -	18
{C And, } [ [  I, + I, ] + I ]  think [ that could, + that's ] a formula that could be applied everywhere, except it must cost a heck of a lot of money if you do, it in public school.	9
{F Oh, } okay.	15
Yeah.	15
{C but, }  <laughter> one of these days, -	9
Right.	15
<<Speaker whispers to someone in the background>> She had another call.	10
I'll offer anything that I can on the subject.	24
{C And } I feel like that now [ if  I went, + if I had gone ] to a small college that only had a couple of thousand that I wouldn't [ have, + have ]  gotten as much exposure to different people and [ different, + {F uh, }  {A I don't know, } different ] languages, different cultures, and things like that just by being  around those fifty thousand students.	24
{D Well, }  {D see } that's something I want to see,	24
{F Oh, } we'll go to them all.	24
[ he ha-, +  {D you know, } his ] retirement plan and then to  (( CODA ))  and stuff like that, that's all we, -	24
GREEN CARD.	11
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } it's, {F uh, } (( )) French	26
{F Uh, } [ the, + ] when we came back, I do not know if you have seen.	8
Yes,	15
Yeah.	15
{C But } just by the mere fact of outlawing handguns, would make it so that it would be not as conspicuous,	24
-- he likes to try that,	24
{C but, } -	26
they built a golf course at the bottom,	24
{C but } then due to technicalities, she was going to be out of jail within eighteen months after she was sentenced.	24
{D Well, } it sounds like you do quite a bit of it.	22
{F Oh, } you have children <laughter>.	29
Yeah,	4
Yes,	36
{C So } you're working on your doctorate?	7
it's in one of the older areas of town --	24
Uh-huh.	4
-- {C but, } {F uh, } I think it's a good idea -- -- because a lot of people still want to  drive the older cars -- -- which you can't blame them for that --	9
{C and, } -	26
{C and, } {F uh, } -	26
they do.	24
I think that's going to be one of those  [ that's, + {F uh, } that's ] won by the home team, {D you know, }	9
I sell sporting goods	24
[ the, +  the ] water was murky,	24
<Laughter>.	20
all three of my daughters are married,	24
Again the, -	26
{C and } I did a lot of latch hook -- -- made rugs and stuff.	24
Uh-huh.	15
yeah.	15
# Uh-huh.  #	15
# Yeah. #	15
{F Uh. }  University of Texas in Dallas.	24
we don't although we enjoy it.	24
{C and, }  {F uh, } they both got ran over. After we had them for several years, just nice little outside dogs	24
[ [ we, +  h-, ] +  he ]  went to the bathroom in the bathroom.	24
{C and } they lost again.	24
I'm still trying to find my way around.	24
Yeah,	4
{C And } I think everything except  breakfast was seafood for almost a week.	24
if we were going to get anything now it would definitely be a cat, or even a bird or a fish tank or [ something, + {D you know } <laughter>. Something ] small --	24
[ And, + and ] -- -- are not there all the time	9
{D Well, } I think, {F uh, } it wouldn't hurt,	9
That will cost you a fortune.	9
{C But } now, it's just me and my husband,	24
They are getting a handle on that, in fact, {F uh, }  my oldest daughter [ is, + {F uh, } is ] {F uh, } a nurse	24
{C But } there can still be an attitude of -- -	9
{C and, } {F uh, } drug dealing, {F um, } that's close	9
Pop bottles -- -- all had a deposit on them.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } I love it.	24
# Uh-huh.  #	15
They don't how tough it is out there to make a living.	9
{D Well, } that's fun.	21
<Noise> Yeah.	36
I think, {F uh, } [ they're getting, + they're especially getting ] their life back together now	9
{C so } that's, -	26
B I R D?	7
{C but, } {D you know. } -	26
There's no professional hockey teams [ in, + # in ] Texas  ((   )) <throat_clearing>. #	24
is that good?	7
Oh,	15
{D So } anything else you cook <laughter>.	31
I think they just don't even, -	9
It's black,	24
They offer what they call the mandatory version, # which # is basically major medical	24
Where if you said a certain thing and say, okay, we're all going to have fried fish, or, we're all going, to have fried chicken.	24
{D Well, } I have, -	26
{C so } I'm actually managing to do this with zero debt.	24
{C And } that I couldn't watch,	24
<<pause>> I think they could do more about, {F uh, } voting.	9
what's amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years.	9
Yeah.	15
# Bye-bye. #	38
Exactly.	21
{F Oh, } okay.	38
# [ Have you been, +  # have you been ] to southern Florida?	7
Uh-huh.	15
But, but the minute it hit, hits the paper then, of course, the Kennedys and the ((Misinvolves)) and the ((Udalls)) and the, and, uh, the ((Dawes)) from Georgia, all stand up and scream and yell about what a horrible thing it is.	9
How funny.	21
Uh-huh,	36
{C So, }  I'm, -	26
it just takes up, {D you know, }  like you say, a lot of your garden area.	9
Yeah.	15
{C because, } {E I mean, } {D you know, } the parents aren't making a living at anything.	24
{C and } it's more fun just to kind of like crunch the cans <laughter>, in the can bank.	24
{F Oh, } my goodness.	21
Right,	36
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } {D well, } I guess I'll get over it.	27
Mostly, I just cook for myself.	24
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
[ it, + it ] would almost be like [ a, + a, ] {F uh } ... -	26
we've been trying to start up a business  and then trying to get my garden going.	24
Yeah.	4
{C and } there was a girl in my class who did a speech on home care of the elderly.	24
No,	36
okay.	15
{C but } the same time, one has to recognize the reality of physical requirements of -- -- of the animal --	9
I had a friend with a Fiero that, {F uh, } they tried and tried and tried and had all kinds of terrible getting that (( pinned ))	24
{C and } people  buy jeans in town,	24
{F Uh. }	15
{D Well, } I think, -	26
{F Uh, }  [  they'll, + they'll ] actually do things like this.	24
Yeah,	36
{C And,} {F uh,} [the, + the] interesting scale that they assigned it, {F uh,} the one being a banned and ten being no regulations or totally free  <breathing>.	24
{C And } my level of interest is quite high with P C -s	24
[  Some, + sometimes ] that's fine,	9
it's just like you say,	9
Anyway, as far as clothing goes, {F um, } my wardrobe changes all the time, depending on my size <laughter>.	24
<Laughter> Yeah,	15
Like the [ Census Bureau, + United States Census Bureau. ]	24
{C And } [ it's, + it's ] beneficial to the small towns too because, they [ really, + really ] [ have, + have ] a disadvantage that we wouldn't understand because we're in the Metroplex.	9
Oh.	15
Oh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
He's never been gone  for,  at  all --	24
{C and } one of the fish was missing	24
[ Ours, + {F um, } ours ] barks  more [ than, + {F um, } than ] some, because she spent a lot of time at our friends house.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{E I mean, } they all have {D like } shopping carts and -- -- stuff	24
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
# Yeah. #	15
Uh-huh.	15
{D well } that's true.	36
{C But, } {F uh, } I think [ the worst, + the worst ] thing is when it's raining.	9
Uh-huh.	15
My mother has dogs	24
Ye-, -	26
{C and } what he did, he put, {F uh, } a bar right in the center, # and # put [ some, + ] {F uh, } a glass rack down,  so you had {D like } wine glasses hanging from the ceiling and then the bar	24
Ludwig, yes.	36
Okay,	15
{D You know, } mini series and so  forth,	24
# Yeah,	4
Uh-huh?	12
{F Oh, } are they?	12
In fact, [ the, + the ] guy that was on,  the weatherman on channel eight worked for me, {F oh, } long time ago, twenty years or so, even longer than that.  Twenty-one, twenty-three years ago or so, twenty-four, {D anyway }  long time ago	9
{C but } I do not know	19
{F Oh, } okay.	15
{C And then, } ultimately, they say, no	24
Start.	18
I just like Willie Nelson I guess because he's such a character.	24
{D Wow, } that's rough.	21
after that, {D you know, } you never think of it  [ because, + I guess because ] I paid for all of my college education myself,  I never thought about doing that because I had all these college loans I'd started paying back.	24
[ [ [ {C And, } + {C and so, } ] + {F um, } {C but, } ] + {C but } ] when you go to order a drink, {F um, } {D you know. }   ((   ))  say, [ [ they, + they, ] + I don't know, it's ] {F uh } ... -	24
that's exactly right.	36
Yeah,	36
They say  ((   ))  ruined them <laughter>.	9
# I'm [ su-, + # sure ] that's coming though.	24
<Noise> {F Oh, } I like far out facts or whatever.	24
((   )) , they don't want  [ anyone with exper-, + <throat_clearings>  -- -- anyone with particular experience ]  or knowledge of the legal system.	24
Wonder because football, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
-- {C and, }  {F uh. }  It's actually kind of fun to drive.	24
You miss the whole thing.	2
there's twelve kids in my family.	24
[ thing, + things, ] -	26
{C so } he started with the B B gun and shot a couple of  holes in a couple of windows	24
yeah.	4
No.	36
Yeah, #	26
It seems that, {F uh, } [ bermuda's, + bermuda's ]  fine	9
Yeah.	15
you know what I'm saying,	16
I'm in semiconductor division too.	24
{F Um. }  {D Well, } {D you know, } Sears was one of the few department stores that never would take any other credit cards.	24
whoever came up with this was pretty smart because it was pretty, {F uh, } unique -- -- I think, when they started it.	9
{C or. } -	26
Yeah.	15
It was quite a large -- -	24
{C and, } {F uh, } I don't know,	19
Uh-huh.	15
[ is that, + is that ] reported in the Texas papers?	7
Yeah.	15
uh-huh.	36
[ It, + it ] might have one best picture, too.	9
{D Well, } I hope you have [ a, + an ] opportunity to garden again.	24
Right.	15
I'm not educated at all in, {F uh, } really detecting this	24
[ The, + the  ] older one [ is not, + was not  ] at all into, {F uh, } sports for the most part.	24
[ it's, + {D like, }  it's ] a flag,	24
I know, [ it sounds, + it always sounded, ] -	26
{C And } we wanted his center of attention at home	24
<Noise>.	20
{F uh, } uh-huh.	15
We have wooden floors	24
Yeah.	15
{C And, } {F uh, } you also don't see the litter there.	24
I don't think the general audience [ would, + would ] go for it.	9
Well you know, why not,	16
[ this -- + -- it ] [ s-, + seems ] to be we're turning into a black and white society,	9
<Laughter>.	20
[ {C and } -- + -- # {C and } ] you walk around # the rest of your life with one hand	9
Uh-huh,	15
{C but } {D like, } -	26
{D well, } actually I haven't worked for any large companies per se -- -- {F uh, } recently	24
<Laughter> I'm twenty-six.	24
what did he shoot him with.	39
{C and } I don't want to wash it, because that would start breaking down the batting  and so forth,	24
{D Well, } then, of course you like him.	9
I had a friend from there.	24
uh-huh.	15
{C And } she has [ really, + really ] done good.	24
Uh-huh.	15
I guess one of the things [ was + ] that influenced me was that [ I, + I've ] worked in radio stations as a D J for all my college years trying to support my way through there,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Okay.	29
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } if your wife isn't working out of the home and sending letters	9
That's the way, -	26
{D Well. } -	26
{F Oh, } I liked that movie.	24
<Laughter>.	20
It seems like if you're getting to that level, [ y-, + you're ] not in real good control.	9
Sure.	15
Huh-uh.	15
No.	33
{F Oh, } okay.	15
Five hundred dollars a week. # For two kids.	24
{D So, } I was on my way to work one day	24
Bye, bye.	38
{C so } I feel sort of, {F uh, }  {D you know, } like it's sort of defeating my purpose to go rip everything out now <laughter> and do it over just because I'm in the mood to do it.	24
<Laughter> He helps me out a lot	24
Yeah.	15
That's pretty good.	21
((   )) ,	20
{C and then } there would be a whole ton of other kids, all in the same room, {D you know, }	24
this is where I start having my problems with my company.	24
Oh.	29
{F Oh. }  H-, -	29
Yeah.	15
{C and } I saw, there were some stop signs, {E I mean, } submerged up to the writing on the stop sign,	24
{F Oh, } is that right?	12
Right,	15
Yeah,	15
My wife does <noise>.	24
{C or } they're never going to get anywhere.	9
{C and } the stadium's right off the Interstate <laughter>.	24
{C So, } {F um, } it's strange, because [ it, + it ] [ so, + ] hit so close to home that {F um, } my father's an only child,	24
Yeah.	15
[ I'm, + I'm ] kind of a compulsive obsessive person <laughter>	24
Yeah.	15
sometimes they come on [ and, + and ] say.	24
[ You do it, + you do a ] mile in about eight minutes or less?	7
{F Oh, } yeah.	36
{C And } there's also an antigovernment mood in the country, {D you know, }  where government is misspending your dollars	9
{C so. } -	26
{D So } there's always something.	24
# {C and } # [ I'm just, + I just ] want to hug them, # and # go, you are just fantastic.	24
{D Well, } we don't actually have a [ budget, + budget ] per se.	24
{C and } we're just kind of touching on a basic -- -- computer.	24
{C And then } the popcorn and everything else,	9
Uh-huh.	15
yeah.	26
That's true.  {D Well, }	21
That's right.	36
{C and } they [ had her teaching, + {E or } were starting to have her teach ] history for the soldiers. When [ the, + they ] decided [ that, + that ] she needed to start recanting of all of her pre, {F uh, } <breathing> regime crimes as it were.	24
-- [ they, +  they ] have to be hardened to it	24
Oh.	15
I know.	24
It was a solid watermelon with a wedge cut out of it.	24
{C and, } I had more friends than that,	24
Yeah,	36
{F Um, } yeah	26
[ {C or, } + {C or } ] it's not happening in your backyard --	9
-- just set it up	9
Uh-huh.	15
Right.	15
Yeah,	36
Yes,	15
And it made all the, -	26
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
People need to take a stand.	9
I guess not,	9
Uh-huh.	15
Right <laughter>.	15
My husband was just having a fit <<trying to sound like her husband>> don't have him sing that song <laughter>.	24
No,	33
{F Oh, } they'll eat them.	24
when he was in that gun club where he was doing that  <noise> <<can't tell if it's a cough or something was hit>>. -	24
You know, just awful things.	24
{F Uh, } you ready for this?	7
{C And } I think that's what makes one feel  invaded is the fact that there seems to be little control	9
<Smack> <inhaling> My husband just  graduated from the university, {F uh, } <smack> a year ago --	24
It's, {F uh, } an old, {F uh, } university that turned into a place for the mentally retarded.  {F Uh, }	24
{F uh, } we hope, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
-- {C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } I think I really do miss the fact, {D you know, }  (( that )) it's not a university, that [ there's, + there's ] not, [ the, + the, ]  {D you know, } -	24
{F Uh, } I need to,	34
{C and then } I got this nasty letter from them saying, You're overdue, pay.	24
I really enjoy, -	24
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh,	15
{D You know, } having movies, {F uh, } back then it was ninety-nine cents.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C But } I don't feel  we should be loaning money like that.	9
Uh-huh.	4
{D So, } how do you feel about the metric system?	31
I guess in some cases they just consider  pickup [ your, + your ] phone [ [ and, + and, ] +   and ] not let you use your phone for a while whether  you hang up on them or not.	24
Gee.	21
[ [ {C But, } + {C or, } ] + {C or } ] even somewhere better,	24
{F Uh, } are you using windows?	7
[ {C and } -- + -- {C and } ] they just give you a teacher's assistants, {D you know } --	9
Oh.	15
{D So } what I, -	26
{C So, } -	26
{C but } -- -- just seems like in some cases that [ it's a, + it's a ] good policy.	9
[ {C and, } + {C and } ]  when you employ the Word of God there's nothing as powerful as the Word of God.	9
{D Well } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] think  overall that's right.	40
{C and } so many parents are # facilitators. #	9
I'm twenty-nine.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Is that not good?	7
{C and } [ after, + after ] wasting the first six years, partying and everything else, I decided, uh-huh, time to settle down and do something.	24
that was what I was going to say.	24
That's right,	36
{C but } [ not, + ] I do, {F uh, } the world a favor	24
I probably lived in one of those when I was a little girl <laughter>.	24
Uh-huh.	15
I can't remember [ [ one it is, + if it's the, ] + [ it + ] it's the ] Toyota [ or, + or ] one of the other ones.	24
Yeah.	15
I don't, not at home.	24
Nor do we,	24
{C and then } I had a second one eighteen months later,	24
Let's see,	1
No,	33
{F Oh, } real southern,	11
Mike, I'm calling from Dallas, from Richardson.	6
{F Oh, } really <laughter>?	12
{C and } I really have had a lot of problems with it, <laughter>	24
{C and then } there are some that may be  will come like four inches or five inches above the knee.	9
Yeah,	36
{C And, } {F uh, } then I have given that up,	24
{D So. } -	26
I haven't.	24
{D Well } -- -- right now trying to keep abreast of, {F uh, } what's going on in Europe, {D you know, } with all the, U S S R's satellites breaking off, trying to become independent and, {D you know, } European community coming together.	24
that's true,	36
{F Uh, } {D you know, } I'm not looking for one with a great big engine, {F uh } --	24
Yeah.	15
let's see,	17
Uh-huh.	15
{C but, } {F uh, } sometimes health care, {F uh, } when you get into a universal system lacks in, {F uh, } what would be considered, {F uh, } -	24
{C but } now we're in a situation where the United States [ is, + looks ] like we're it now.	9
I have a nineteen eighty-six Toyota, {F uh, }	24
I'll bet.	21
{C and } [ they're very, + he's very ]  affectionate when he wants to be,	24
{F Um, } [ I'm, + I'm ] glad that we're starting to pay our debts off, now, {F um, } {D you know, }	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F gosh, } you never will, probably.	9
I don't need to care about this.	25
Every person out  there should have kids, at least once [ or, + or ]  have some they can borrow for a time, because everyone needs some torture in their lives.	9
So far I've been trying to call all day because <laughter> I keep getting these subjects like  capital punishment	24
Oh.	15
{C or, } -	26
# Yeah. #	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C And so } [ it, +  it ] works out nice,	9
<barking> Uh-huh,	36
{C But } now we start in May, breaking it down,	24
{C but } the  ((   ))  use of drugs or anything like that, # will, # {F uh, } be a problem.	9
{E I mean, }  I wouldn't be so  upset about the amount of taxes paid if it weren't for the fact that [ they don't, + they don't ]  go to any place.	24
{C And } it's, one nice thing  about T I is after you've been here, {F uh, } for five years, # you # get three weeks.	24
A growing part.	2
{C and so }  we really have to keep it together to get just her activities in and still have time to spend with each other.	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C and } we started doing, {F um, } large quantities of chlorination of water starting around, {F uh, } where we experimented with it in nineteen oh three and nineteen thirteen <noise> most of the major cities had chlorinated water.	24
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] I liked, {F uh, } Aerosmith and -- -- Led Zepplin [ and, {F uh } -- + -- {D you know, } and, ] {F uh, } {A jeez who else is there. } Van Halen.	24
How do people in Texas deal with Dallas, Houston  and San Antonio.	39
{D Well, } how do you feel about [ spot test-, + spot testing ] for drugs?	31
Yeah.	4
{C and } [ I, +  I ] agree with you also, that I feel like it was not worth the  money spent or the lives lost to fight that war.	9
Yeah.	15
<Laughter>.	20
{C So } I do, love to see young kids go [ and, + and ] men take the pets and everything.	24
it's just totally gone to, {F uh, } -	9
Yeah,	15
{C but, } I thought she was treated badly for being a woman, {A frankly, I really did }  [ by, + by, ]   {F uh, } [ [ the +  <snorting> the ] + ] then vice-presidential candidates, {F uh, } who really, I thought, had a  demeaning attitude towards her.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } we just recently had a counselor at elementary.	24
What's that?	14
when they come down I'll grill those -- -- and brush on a little lemon butter sauce	24
-- {F uh, } let's see,	17
One of the advantages of not having pitchers who are -- -	9
she would think this is like an invasion of her privacy, is like going through her purse, like if you ever needed money and stuff --	24
# {F Oh } [ that's, +  {F uh, } # That will be ] pretty.	21
{E I mean, } what you see  affects how you think and therefore what you do.	9
# He # did BATMAN also, which, {D you know } <breathing>  <laughter>. -	24
{D Well, } <noise> [ I just, + {F uh, } we've, ] {D you know } -	26
Down by Big Bend?	23
yeah,	36
[ I don't, + I see, ] {F um, } -	26
{C And } I pay a lot of property taxes.	24
I can remember staying home, when I was five and six, and my mother watching the EDGE OF NIGHT.	24
# <Throat_clearing> No. #	36
# <Tone>. # {F Uh, } I love the irony of,  {F uh, } talking about this subject on April the, fifteenth <sniffing>.	24
Tell me your name again.	18
{C and } I left at halftime --	24
{C And } until we [ have to, + have to ]  learn to think that way, we won't.	9
Were you shocked like, {F oh } {D no, } I'm stuck I need to buy stuff.	7
exactly.	36
[ If, + if ] the isolation concept really  works that good, why are our prisons overcrowded?	16
Right.	15
yeah.	15
{C And, } {F uh, } if I couldn't have my luxury Maxima -- -- then I'd buy me a fancy little red  (( C R X ))  sports car <laughter>.	24
{E I mean, } [ they, +  they ] find out [ whether, + ] just how much of a people person they are.	9
(( yeah )) ,	26
We really do.	9
I guess I assumed you were here.	24
{C So } I think, {F uh, } my preference [ [ would be a small, + small, ] + if I had to find day care -- -- would be a small, ] someone that I knew <laughter>.	24
{C But, } I think, -	9
{D Well, } that's easier done in a  company than it is in, {F uh, } school teaching.	9
just the smell is so bad <laughter>, of the horses.	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } I particularly like  TOUR OF DUTY	24
I don't, -	26
yeah.	15
Right.	15
{C but } I find it to be very -	24
{E I mean, } you can't give, <laughter>  anyone too many chances --	9
Uh-huh,	15
Oh.	15
Yeah,	36
{C so, } # other, # -	26
{C But } [ at + ] the tools and the space to do it,  [ that, + that  ] can be a big problem [ if it's, + if it's  ] under carriage or something like  that.	24
{F Oh, } my word.	21
{D Well, } [ with, + with ] your, {D you know, } -	26
{C And so, } if we can raise [ it, + ] {F uh, } {D you know, } generations with those concerns, we'll solve a lot of our problems.	9
{C And, } it gets worse,	9
{C but } [ they, + {D well } they ]  have, -	26
you're right.	36
[ All I know, + all's I can really remember  ] is him flying this great big dog, this great big huge sheep dog sort of looking thing,	24
Bye-bye.	38
I'm inside the beltway.	24
What I have always identified is I am basically good with money.	24
Uh-huh.	15
I wouldn't, -	26
That is a really pretty state park.	9
{F Uh, } [ maybe, + maybe ]  too a big social change [ that's, + that's ] maybe for the worst [ [ is, + {F uh, } is, ] + is ]  how, {F um, } the people's, {F uh, } views [ on, + on ] relationships has changed, {D you know, }	9
{C But, }  I think it's about an hour.	24
{D Actually, } there seems to be an  alternative in my neighborhood.	24
{F oh, } that's kind of side tracked,	19
{D Anyway, } {D so, }  where's your favorite place to go?	39
<laughter> This lady in our bass club,  we had a tournament yesterday	24
{F Uh, }    *[[slash error]] I don't think, -	26
Uh-huh.	4
Yeah.	4
# I [ think, # + think ] it might be.	9
{C Because } {D see } what happens is they have a good backup policy.	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C But } to me it's worthwhile in the end.	24
{C and } if he gets in there and starts rooting around and finds something in there that's really tremendously wrong with it, then he eats it.	24
that's right.	36
{C but } # it's for the more general, -	26
-- {C so } that's about it.	24
Do you think our government agencies should test?	7
{D Well, } my husband didn't like that,	24
{C But } the thing, {F uh, } also is that,  {D you know, } {D like } if you want to go out {D like } if you want to go to a restaurant or  something, then I have to moderate that because it's like I can't go eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars, {F um, } {D you know, } three times a week.	24
Right.	15
I have someone at the door.	24
W-, -	26
{C and } I,  [ so + ] really I haven't gone fishing for about two years now --	24
book -- -- {C and } they thought that was wonderful	24
yeah,	4
{C and } we happen to live in Dallas which is extremely crime, # ridden,	24
Okay.	29
No,	33
{F Uh, } Nacogdoches.	24
{D Well } -- -- # [ it's, + it's ] <talking>  <<female and children in the background>>, # pretty.	24
when we'd have family home evening and everybody  would sit in the living room and  the fire would be burning he'd walk across  my feet sometimes <laughter>.	24
{C And, } -	26
That just bugs me to death.	24
I understand.	21
<Laughter> I do the same thing.	36
I don't know.	19
{C So, } {D you know, } the project's kind  of halted until then.	24
# The mainstay,	2
{C and so } I'm sort of out of business.	24
{C and } he was across the river <lipsmack>.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	15
[ they, + I think they ] look at it as, {D well } everybody, the majority of the people think this way, when that's not necessarily true, because, {D you know, } that's what the media says.	9
{D Well, } we do.	36
-- {C and } I never did like it after that --	24
{F Oh, } that's great.	21
Without a doubt.	9
To eradicate it entirely, yeah.	22
{C and, } -	26
Yeah,	15
{D So, } -	26
Yeah,	15
-- hey, we think this guy can really make some changes	25
{C So } [ yo-, + I ] am, <lipsmack>	26
{C So } [ [ I, + I ] don't really, + I don't really ] dress up a whole lot.	24
That's right.	36
{C But, }  {F uh, } -	26
{C so } I -- -	26
yeah,	15
Yeah.	15
That's pretty sad because,  {E I mean, } I don't know, something's got to change with the schools.	9
I guess, {F um, } I'm going to school  while I'm working at T I,	24
{F Oh, } yeah,	36
{C and } I said, that's a quick release, right there.	24
{C and. }  There's going to a special this week.	24
Yeah,	15
[ [ Does, +  does he, ] +  does it ]  have a happy ending,	7
Thank you.	38
Uh-huh.	15
Now is it Stacy?	7
Yeah,	36
# Right. #	15
{C And } the patio that came with that house, {F uh, } was not laid on  a, {D like, } -	24
<Cough> {C and } they'll tell you they've written  something down,	24
[ [ {C And, }  # + <Laughter> {C and, } ] + {C and } ]  [ my, + my ] wife, {D you know, } {D you know, }  looks at all those bills that come in	24
it might come back in another way,	9
{C cause } [ I just kind of, +  {F uh, } I just ] have all the books out,  {D you know, }	24
{C And } I understand that walking is suppose to be [ the, + {D like, } the ] best  exercise.	9
{C or } is he  older now or younger	35
<Sniffing> {C So } {C and } that was before we got married,	24
{C and } he has got over ten thousand head of buffalo [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } [ we, + my dad ] has got a little plane, we flew over it all a-, looked at the buffalo,	24
It's, {F uh, } -	15
I think so.	9
I know it.	36
{F Uh, } -	26
My husband <breathing> kept begging me,	24
uh-huh.	15
# {F Oh, } yeah,	15
{C And } I know I have a bunch of younger brothers and sisters,	24
that's true.	36
{C but, }  {F uh, } seems to me that, {F uh, }  kids these days, {F uh, } <throat_clearing> can really get away with murder	9
{F Uh, } [ it's, + it's ] unbelievable	9
Then I didn't notice any improvement till [ the, + after the ] sixth one.	24
then he went out [ to S, + to southern Cal. ]	24
{C and, }  the Lakers have always been amazing to watch.	9
On fact, [ my, + {F uh, } my ]  grandmother does that a lot, because she's blind,	24
Jeez {C and } you can't take the chances.	9
Do you have department store credit cards too,	7
Yeah,	15
{F Um, }  I got money to pay that, too.	24
Oh.	15
<Laughter>.	20
{F Oh, } it was,	24
Yeah.	15
{D So } {D well, } [ you're, + [ you, + you ] take ] this subject much more personally than I do, I suppose.	9
Uh-huh.	15
they'll never get caught.	9
Yeah,	15
<Laughter>  Yeah.	15
{C but } it's big enough.	9
{F Oh, } five years now.	24
The # burden # -- -- shouldn't be placed on the consumer.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Right, {F uh, }	36
What was I going to say about that,	1
<Laughter>  Yeah,	15
Exactly	36
{C or, } -	26
My wife's about five months along --	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C But } I do like the food. [ [ If that, + [ so, + ] if that, ] + if that ] amounts for anything.	24
I had a friend that had a roommate that worked for T I	24
{C and } we're not even going to get the exact same number of dollars back.	9
[ we were just about, + we were getting ready ] to go swimming,	24
{F Um. } Right.	15
Probably quite a few black people up there	9
Uh-huh,	15
{C But, }  {F uh, } I love to watch the five o'clock news	24
I think they're a very difficult group to integrate into, {F uh, }  society.	9
I change oil,	24
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] I feel like I'm obligated to  do it, because I've been doing it	24
[ I, +  I ] haven't gotten into that too much because, [ I, +  {F uh, } if I ] don't know the story line and, {F um, } I don't speak  the language, then I have difficult time, comprehending what's going on.	24
[ [ have you, + did you, ] + have you ] grown up in Dallas, Stephanie?	7
{C and } you?	7
{C and } I work for a tire service, here in, -	24
I have a farm a hundred miles east of here in East Texas,	24
Right.	15
Yeah,	15
It's someone, {D you know, } keeping an eye on the kids	9
Right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
I'm sorry.  {D You know, }	9
I'm the same way.	24
Uh-huh.	15
one, {F uh, } big thing that, the advise that I would give to a parent to give to his or her child is to [ let  their, + let their ] child experience college in a kind of general sense.	24
{F uh, } [ I, + {F uh, } when I ]  was younger, I played a little bit	24
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] that's just a part of the country that it's rolling hillside.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } it is really making me want to exercise	24
they said we don't want to have to decide all these things,	24
Yeah.	15
# Bye-bye. #	38
[ It's, + it's ] really not that much trouble.	24
Yeah,	4
{C But } that's, {F uh, } <lipsmack> -	26
{F Oh, } boy --	21
{F Um, } I'm not sure what contributes to air pollution exactly.	24
{F Uh } <noise>, what kind of books do you read?	39
{F Oh, } I agree.	36
[ [ {C and } + {F uh, } {C and, }  ] + {C and }  ] {F uh, } it keeps me going.	24
Right.	36
I think that's the main problem.	9
Yeah.	15
That's right.	36
Yeah,	4
{C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, }  [ when, +  back when ] I was a kid, {D you know, } mom would send me out to weed the garden.	24
<Laughter> Yeah,	15
# {D Well } maybe I'll get you next time. #	9
{C So } America's safe for another fifteen m-, -	24
{F Um. }  {D Well } I'll tell you. Sometimes [ it's, + it's ] pretty bad here.	24
# Wow,	21
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } sooner or later I need one.	24
(( He loves ))  God,	24
For doing nothing,	15
it would have slept three adults anyway.	24
Yeah, {F uh, }	15
I have no perspective on how it relates to other diseases,	24
{C and } I don't think there are many women in the engineering college.	24
{F Oh, } really.	12
Right.	15
Yeah.	15
fif-, -	26
{D You know, } I think he wasn't a real mountain man,	24
<Lipsmack> Yes.	15
[ I couldn't, + I don't ] like to cook.	24
the timing [ of, + of ] it is  good, besides  (( the amo-, ))  what's on.	9
{E I mean, } [ if, + if ] they're not interested fine.	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
Lots and lots of catnip,	24
Just from city to city then  ((   )) .	8
[ We've, + {F uh, } we ] thought probably our neighborhood in Houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of, {F um, } the family that  had them [ and, + and ]  bred them.	24
obviously, if someone of mine who has close died, I'd probably feel differently,	19
[ {C So, } + {F uh, } {C but } ] the others I'm too far away to help them out at all.	24
# {D Well, } do you have an # older car?	7
Uh-huh.	15
<Throat_clearing>.	20
Everybody else was an import.	24
Right along in there somewhere, suddenly the air feels cleaner.	24
If I can't understand the words I don't want to listen to it.	24
{C And } I've seen an awful lot of <whispering> lately really [ dumb, + dumb ] retrievers	24
that's, -	26
{C but, } I think that's for  [ the, + the ] few and far between.	9
# Exactly,	36
It's {D like, } {D you know, } I love you	24
Yeah.	15
you get certain circumstances where you hear about these people that have, {D you know, } stolen kids and, {D you know, } # done # terrible things to them and killed them and, {D you know, } that sort of thing,	24
# Yeah. #	15
Uh-huh.	15
It's a little, {F uh, } sort of getaway  retreat village not far from Shanghai.	24
{F Uh, } I would think kind of a subdued color would be nice.	11
Yeah,	36
{C and } that symbol means a lot to me.	24
Yeah.	36
I have a sister that lives in Dallas,	24
{C and } the # -- -- guys get together	9
There's something about working with wood  [ that, + that ] I enjoy, that, -	24
[ # I give # them a, + I give them an ] allowance	24
Uh-huh.	15
# Okay.  #	15
I did, too.	24
{D So, }  obviously though, do you think they're going to do anything in the playoffs to make it to the Super Bowl this  year	22
Yeah,	15
{F Oh, } yeah.	21
Uh-huh.	15
[ {C but, } + {C and } ] here I guess it depends on what you want,	9
Yeah.	15
They're both running around now.	24
{C But } we live in Clarion County.	24
{C but } I wonder if there aren't some sociology courses.	24
[ You, + you ] watch many?	7
{F Uh, } {D well, } no,	33
they got to had two or three years in with them you can start buying stock	24
{C And } as always, [ it don-, +   it seems ]  a bit, {F uh, } rushed.	9
{C but } you got to have  people that can [ make, +  {D you know, } earn ] a salary to pay for this conversion.	9
{D well, } -	26
Anyway, <Lipsmack> I really question, though, how much technology the average Soviet is exposed to.	9
I don't have, -	24
{C but } she told me about the Utah Jazz,	24
it's almost a hobby with us.	24
we've been to the humane society,	24
[ {C So, } + {C but, } ]   {F uh, } [ I, +  I ] enjoy most of it,	24
I lived, I lived in Sweden for two years.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
Right.	15
{F Oh, } {D well } {D see, } I [ am, + am ] just in the Publisher's Clearing House and the READER'S DIGEST, because we don't, {F uh, -	24
I usually rent them <laughter>.	24
{C and } I hope it does, though.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Right,	36
I keep telling them it's the same mentality <laughter>  {D you know, }	24
Bye-bye.	38
No, {F uh, }	36
In fact, {D you know, } I can't imagine <talking> anybody having a semiautomatic for what purpose.	9
But, it's, it's, -	26
{F Um. }	15
# Uh-huh. #	15
That's great.	21
Yeah.	4
Uh-huh,	15
that's really what we want,	24
that's nice.	21
[ I, + I ] agree something should be  done,	24
For us when we go out with the kids obviously we want to go somewhere that we can, -	24
Its, -	26
{C But }  you will probably find after your children get bigger, {F uh, } like when they want things like tricycles, toys, things that cost quite a lot in the store,  you can find that kind of stuff at garage sales for just a few  dollars.	24
I guess this doesn't really have to do with taxes but just money in general,  [ and, +  and, ]  {F um, } wondering if you're going to have enough when you retire <laughter> to live on.	9
Yeah,	15
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } have you.	16
[ {C And, } + {C and } ]  all the white water and  noise {C and } the, -	24
I don't know <laughter>.	19
{C and, } -	26
{D Well, } yeah,	15
Yes.	36
[ When does it, + [ Wh-, +  when ] does it ] bloom?	39
{C so. } {D You know, }  I had to do that job,	24
<Laughter>.	20
{F Uh. } I'm going into all this because [ I used to w-, +   I just got done <laughter> working ] at a pet shop actually.	26
Right,	15
{D well } that's, -	26
I kind of like that feature,	24
Right,	36
{D Anyway, } that's about where I stand <laughter>.	24
I didn't realize they had no state tax in Texas.	24
you said you do a lot of needlework	24
There may be a few, but very incidental.	9
But that's all they check for,	8
The whole family was so disappointed <laughter>.	24
yeah,	36
{F Oh, } yeah,	4
I work, -	26
right.	36
{C and } I just happened to walk back into my office.	24
{C And } as far as the other states, I honestly don't know what their capital punishment is.	24
I would love to.	34
Right.	15
{E I mean } they just go down the ice.	24
I have {D like } a Diner's Club [ through my, {F um, } + where I ] work --	24
{F  Oh, } gosh,	21
Wisconsin, {F uh, } and  Milwaukee area, {D you know. }	24
[  It's, + it's ] an enjoyable part of driving.	24
{F Um, } it's an I B M,	24
Oh <laughter>.	15
{D Well, } sewing does [ [ take up, + take an ]  awful lot of time, + takes an awful lot of time. ]	9
No.	36
{C and } I really, -	26
{C and } [ now N C N B + {C And } now N C N B's ] got a little larger market  share,	24
Have you just started doing this?	7
There's, -	26
If -	26
what, -	26
{C and } I was real upset	24
{D Well, } we don't right now,	5
# Yeah.   #	15
{C or } do you actually  put up a tent	35
<laughter> {F Oh, } the house needs cleaning, I guess I had better have a dinner party <laughter>.	24
No, {F uh. }	36
we -- -- do practice capital punishment,	24
yes.	36
{C but } that's one thing to be said for credit.	9
{C And } they're saying how there's going to be a lot more parking for the stadium.	24
Just a minute.	18
{C and } of course, the Plano  area is basically with alleyways,	24
but, I've enjoyed it.	24
{F Oh, } is it like a foreign exchange type student?	7
Yeah.	15
{C and, } {F uh, } I like ROSIE O'NEILL.	24
Okay,	26
{C And } that really helped us out a great deal.	24
Many of the boys in the room had children	24
Right,	11
{C And  so } I like the I B M P C, personally.	24
yeah. #	15
Uh-huh.	15
{F uh, } {F uh, } though, {D actually, }  in som-, -	26
{F Uh, } have you seen SHRIMP ON THE  (( BARBY )) ?	7
{C but, } {F uh } -- -	26
all the exhaust.  {F Uh, }	26
[ I don't, +  I don't ]   predict,	24
Yeah,	30
{C and then } we can work off of there.	18
I did see that --	24
{C and } [ you don't, +   because it doesn't have words, {D you know, }  you don't ] feel like, there's anything you have to remember, {D you know, } as far as  singing a song or something like  that or interpreting what they mean	9
{D You know, } {E I mean, } of course,  I guess some people go out and spend their whole entire limit on it like that at that time	9
{F Uh. }	15
-- {D you know, } all the comedies are  more like jokes and, {D you know, } gags and  stuff like that --	9
I think it's real important  to be part of a team.	9
My wife says she can't stand it.	24
Right.	15
If we get a place where we can have both, it'll be great,	24
it'd be good	9
-- I think what you said [ is, + is ] really a pinpoint, though, that the student and the family life really adds or detracts -- -- what's happening in the school --	36
just be consistent and diligent -- -- with it	22
Do you find yourself, {F um, } with all the, {F um, } cholesterol [ and, + and ] high fiber changing the way [ that you  fi-, + that you entertain?  ]	7
Right.	15
Huh.	15
{C And } what would that be like, a clam or, {F uh, } -	7
I just, -	26
# Okay.  #	29
# Good-bye <clicking> <music>. #	38
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } {C and } occasionally what we'll each do depending on whoever is driving is have the newspaper sort of on our lap on the way [ in, + in ] the car,	24
[ It's, +  I think it's ]  just something that goes with the territory.	24
Or [ [ if, + i-, ] + if ] they could be real, real nearby where they could see them everyday or so.	9
# {C And } # this is actually a <laughter>  an internship up here.	24
my wife would just love that.	24
Yeah,	36
{C And } they'll just wear your common, ordinary, {D you know, } whatever you [ might + <laughter> -- -- might  ] say,	24
{D So, } <noise>   it's really quite interesting.	9
Yes,	36
{C And } that really made a bad impression on me <laughter>.	24
{D see, } [ I've got a, + on my stereo I've got [ a, +  a, ] ] {F uh, } turntable, and then I've got a dual cassette	24
{C and } they call you right [ when, + when ] you've just gotten home from work.	24
We're in Sherman.	24
# Is it? #	12
{F Uh, } number one, I am one hundred percent for  total gun [ t-, + ] control.	24
[ how far, + about how far  ] do you go walking?	39
{D Well, } it turns out that so much,	24
Yeah <laughter>.	4
[ I, + I ] don't even know if I have any other real regular ones that I watch.	24
<Laughter>.	20
I think some of them, the artists are even, {F uh, } hitting the pop charts.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Yes,	36
They have a, uh, lake cabin	24
I guess its recording.	24
{F Oh, } okay.	29
{C And } I wanted it,	24
[ I, + {F uh, } I ] find I spend so little time [ in the ra-, + in the car ] that I don't really listen to the radio,  {D you know, }	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Huh. }	15
[ we'd, + he'd ] take us,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Of course, I've really wanted to actually manage to get into space someday.	24
{D Well, } I like dining out.	24
[ We, + we ] originally lived in Dallas	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C But, } {D well, } I have teen age children,	24
{C And then } I went to England -- -- a few years ago.	24
{C So, } {D you know, } it depends on how you look at it.	19
I'm home now, # full # time.	38
{C but } amazingly it's {D like, } {F uh, } Massachusetts went back, # and # reinstated capital punishment, {F oh, } maybe six or seven years ago,	24
{C and }  I think they're better people -- -- because of it,	9
Yeah,	15
Any specifics <<mispronounced>>?	13
{C but } she was, -	26
{D You know, }  sometimes I'll have the cookies ready when they, # come home #	24
Do you?	12
Actually make them do something that's  not pleasant and do it and get it over with and get back in the, {D you know, }  world and not spend so much time sitting around, letting the bad influences  of the other ones rub off on them,	9
{C But, }  {D man, } [ I, + I ] just think of all  of the money [ that they, + that they're ] going to have to spend just getting that.	24
that worked out real well	24
{C So. } I hope he makes  up his mind to do it, because -- -- he needs to be remembered.	24
{C So }  [ we, + we ] trade off a whole lot with friends and, {D you know, } run here and run there.	24
<Laughter>	20
{F Oh, } absolutely. Yeah,	11
yeah. #	26
Me, too,	36
{C and } [ I ha-, +   I am ] supposed to be <inhaling> the one who is going to fix it all [ and, + and ] soothe everybody.	25
[ {C And, } + {C and }  ] the only reason I did it, -	24
{C But, } {F uh, } we'd get up at three in the morning and start on our little, {F uh, } escapade for the day and, {F uh, } kind of, {F uh, } do a lot of different things and then stop when we wanted to.	24
{C and } that's [ the, +  the ] family travel vehicle.	24
{D Well, } does you husband,  {F uh, } -	7
{C and, }  {F uh, } we've just been really thrilled, with it too.	24
Uh-huh,	36
{C And } I was able to, {D you know, } get,  his schedule just, {F uh, } cooperated.	24
reading the little words at the bottom  of the screen -	24
that  would be fine.	18
Right.	15
{C and } I'd wonder what is that, {D you know, }	24
{E I mean, } the boys are very open -- -- because [ that's, + that's ] all I have is boys, so  that's all I'm around -- -- basically, is boys,	24
I have two other sisters	24
{D Well, } I watch two,	24
I think they did a pretty good job,	9
that I can, save	24
{C But, } I've been in school ever since <breathing>.	24
{C So, } I think it is communication,	9
{F oh } we're not even supposed to be talking about this though, are we?	7
[ I'm, + I'm ] glad too <laughter>.	24
[ I play, +  I play ] piano,	11
# Sure. #	15
(( That )) , {F um, } -	26
[ Ta-, + Taylor ] my youngest is, -	24
<Breathing> {D Well, } that's all they got right now.	9
Yeah.	15
right <laughter>.	15
{C but } it just hasn't been what I thought it would be.	9
Really.	12
how is Texas about keeping your children out of public schools,	31
{C and } not that many people are really trying I don't think <swallowing>.	9
I don't think they should have to do a year <laughter>.	9
I think that is a very wrong way to handle, {F uh, } disciplining a child.	9
-- {C and, } {D you know, } she spent nine months out of  the year just visiting her children.	24
{C and } from Ohio since we're right near Lake Erie	24
Then, yeah,	2
they always have, -	26
-- yeah.	15
[ You do run in-, + you do run into  ] limitations on yours?	7
{C and } he gave me four choices of cars to buy <laughter>.	24
I live in Maryland,	24
{F Um, }  {C so, }  {F um, } what were you doing when you were using an Apple two E?	39
{E I mean, } that's even another issue, {D you know, }	9
Although we did actually get, -	26
{D Well } <laughter>, -	3
He's working long hours,	24
I would say that our home is a very  typical home for the area that we live in.	24
{F Uh, } I've got a little girl who's six and a little girl that's three.	24
{C but } I don't understand, whose rule is that, {D you know. }   *[[slash error]] Yeah,   *[[slash error]]	13
{C and } of course, we're [ ju-, + ] [ like ther-, + like ] a lot of people.	9
Where do you enjoy dining out?	39
Yeah.	15
{C and } he points out that people in, {F uh, } England -	24
Yeah,	15
{C and } good luck with the baby.	38
{C and } [ I think that, + I think ] we need [ to, + ] a little more justice at home.	9
Yeah.	15
What kind do you have?	39
# It is, # -	26
Right.	15
Yeah.	15
-- {C but, } {F uh, } [ I usually, +   I usually like to make spaghetti or  soup or chili or, {D you know, } something like that -- -- or sometimes a roast,	24
Yeah.	15
I teach a computer classes	24
{C But. } -	26
# {F Oh, } my gosh. #	21
{F Um, }	26
{D Well, } I think [ [ they're at, + they're com-, ] + they've   come  ] a long way. # {F Uh, } # at least some companies. Some of them, {F uh, } my girlfriend, in particular, that works for [ a, + a ] rental car agency	9
{C and } I'm not good enough to raise my child, which basically is true --	9
{C so, } -	26
{D Well, } Richardson's right between Dallas and Plano.	24
Yeah,	36
{C or }  you can set up your work program and your husband's so that one of you is there all the time.	18
# Uh-huh. #	15
{C And } [ you, + you ] recognized this and, was able to, {D you know, } do something about it.	8
{D Well, } that's good.	21
{C and then } if we really think that drugs are a problem we can randomly stop anybody on the street.	9
{C And } also, we need a new bed.	24
Yeah.	4
[  We have, + we have ]  stuff that's very interesting, {F uh, }	24
[ It, + {D well, } {C and } that's ]  probably, -	24
Yeah <throat_clearing>.	15
Uh-huh.	15
we have, {F um, } -	26
I've talked to a lot of people in Texas.	38
Uh-huh.	15
That's neat isn't it?	7
cause I'm sure some of them have good reason to sue	9
-- {C and, } {F um, } I'm going to start with day trips, though, because I don't know the territory and all,	24
{F Oh, } yeah,	36
{C and } that's about it, {D you know. }	24
that's where the real sticking point comes in.	9
-- he crashed and <inhaling> killed some people because he was, {F uh, } smoking some marijuana	24
Uh-huh.	15
I was, # -	24
One thing about D C is that there are a lot of traditional restaurants  where, {D you know, } [ it's, + ] the guy used to be the cook for the Capitol	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
you've got one [ down in, + {F uh, } down near, ] {F uh, } Addison,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } {C and } what does that consist of?	39
{C And, }  it was so good.	24
# Right.	36
Dictator, -	2
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	15
{F Oh } no.	21
[ Any, + any ]  crimes against person, {F uh, } I feel, {F uh, } there should be more than a slap on the hand, and being sent to prison and being released in, {F uh, } two or three years.	9
yeah,	26
[ We're, + {F uh, } we're ] about to take the kids to <noise>  go roller skating and a birthday party and stuff,	24
Insurance should pay for that.	9
{D Well, } I, -	26
<laughter> I hope it doesn't hurt me	24
Maybe that's it,	40
# Uh-huh. #	15
{C and } usually that's enough.	24
Right.	15
Oh.	15
right.	23
Uh-huh	15
She has [ a, + a ]  child in Connecticut who is extremely gifted,	24
# [ [ That, + # that's, ] + that's ]  the state that [ got, + ] was famous when they <noise> executed somebody.	24
[ {C So, } + {F uh, } {C and, } ]  {F uh, } I was thinking, {D you know, }  {D like, } Oh my God, {D you know, } I go back there,	24
{D Well, } have you done much camping around Texas?	7
{C And, } {D you know, }  just,  you see a lot of things like  {D [ you, +  you ] know, } ((   ))  was a great golfer and wanted to play golf when he retired,	24
We have it,	24
{F Uh, } I'm not really sure  if I would want the seat belts attached to the door.	24
Oh.	15
# {C and } # it was really fun	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	38
Yeah.	15
-- {C and } these kids, {F um, } {D you know, }  every girl I taught, except for one, was pregnant.	24
That's what I've heard.	36
-- drives her to school,	24
{E I mean, }  it was nice having access to the, equipment to, {F uh, } -	24
{C and then } you can put raspberry, {F uh, } topping on it --	24
"francs --   *[[ This looks like funny parsing to me.  Shouldn't ""francs"" be part of previous utt, and B.64, with it's coordinating conjunction and indep clause, start a new slash unit? ]] -- {C and } just in a matter of a week  or two the dollar fell against the franc, drastically.   *[[ See note on B.62 utt2 above ]]"	24
Oh.	15
what else did I serve with that.	1
{C and so } I really don't have the obligations there any more -- -- that we have to balance to -- -- {D you know, } get things together for them,	24
[ I've heard, + I've heard ] that's really great, though.	24
# Okay # <Lipsmack>.	29
{C and, } {F uh, }  as a rule, it sounds pretty decent,	24
{C so } even with, {F uh, } {D you know, }  in, {F uh, } inner company,  {D you know, } transfer, or something,	24
I guess  [ they, + they'll ] probably come out with a lot of movies, {D you know. }	9
every so often, -	26
[ Is, + is ] the Kmart there?  <laughter>.	7
In fact, I'd like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only  when you buy a weapon you have to, {F uh, } show that you've gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon. -	9
{C and } it's all right.	9
{C but } now, I've got another one,	24
<Laughter>  {C But } we have {D like } a lot, -	24
You wonder how in the world they ever got them to do some of these things.	24
{D well } {D actually } I live in Florida,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } okay,	29
{C but } there's such cute things, # out for kids.  #	9
{E I mean, } they'd be in the audience screaming and  yelling, # {D you know, }	24
there's a little thing  at the bottom	24
{C And } the kids just love everything that's there,	24
I have, {D you know, } -	26
{C but } I don't think, fossil fuels are the answer.	9
{D Well, } anyway that's one ever my favorite jokes.	24
One of the things that upset me when I lived in California was, {F uh, } they did a lot of things with [ s-, + your Social ] Security number.	24
# {F Um, } {F um. } #	15
Yeah	15
Yeah,	15
{C But, } -	26
{D Well, } {F uh, } I know one thin-,  [ I, +  I ] think Texas has the death penalty, right?	7
I have read that when we were in that area,	24
{D Well, } Dana, it's been really interesting,	38
# <Laughter> Yeah. #	15
{C So, } [ we, + we ] do a lot of, -	26
Yeah, [ it -- + -- it's ] only an advantage for people who had to use pure D O S. ((   ))  base.	9
All the way through history, there's, I guess, -	9
{D Well } [ that's, + that's ] good.	21
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
<Throat_clearing>.   *[[slash error]] Uh-huh.   *[[slash error should be 'b']]	20
Like [ for petty, + for theft ] [ and, + and ] stuff like that or manslaughter, {D you know, } -	9
I'll bet -- -- it was hard to part with that.	9
{F Oh, } great.	21
{C So } maybe there's  something along that same line where, {D you know, } in all these financial, {F uh, } applications that you make out, you don't have to put all that stuff down there.	24
[ [ you, + you ] rarely hear,  +  you hear, ] of course there's cases where someone   has been put [ [ in, +  in, ] + in, ] {F uh, } prison, {F uh, } falsely accused	24
Now it might have been just to take  care of her and the baby, instead of having [ [ a, +  {D you know, } a, ] +   a ] nurse, or someone come in, [ or, + or ] something like that, [ or whatever, +  mid-wife  or whatever ] they call it that they have for the first couple of weeks.	24
{C and } essentially what he had done is set [ [ a, + a ] elec-, + a electrocution ] trap -- -- for the burglar in his own home.	24
{C and } he won't say where the body is because he knows the penalty's [ very [ s-, + s-, ] + ] {D you know, } mandatory life sentences for murder.	24
Do you find trouble keeping the records for taxes and all that	7
Did you?	7
{D Well, } you said you were car buff, {F uh, }	24
Towards each other.	2
It's not clear.	9
{C  so } you know that parts of it are beautiful  and parts of it are squalor.	9
I think that [ the, + ] we still have a long way to go.	9
[ {C But, } + {C but } ] since you have an O U drop out   <laughter> as a quarterback, -	26
Okay.	15
[ Thou-, + those ] are lovely.	9
Yeah.	30
I notice that, {F um, } since we moved here that [ we, + we  ] did get the cable T V,	24
My job is, {F uh, } E D P auditor,	24
Right,	36
{C but } it's also the vacation vehicle that we all drive in.	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
Not really,	5
it depends on the location.	24
I enjoy, {F um, } {D you know, } just, -	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
# {D Well, } [ I, + I ] think [ the, + ] one of the biggest problems that, {F uh, } we see in government today is a reflection of society in and of itself.	9
{F Uh, } let's see,	17
{C And } I started reading, and got about sixty pages into it	24
-- {C but, }  {F um, } now I guess I just have friends  that clip articles	24
For which, if they would just pay me enough money -- -- I would be willing to consider.	24
{C so,} -	26
{C and } I have worked in El Salvador	24
{D So, } then, were they successful?	7
[ {C and so, } + {C so, } ] {D you know, } it's something [ we, + we ] have tried to help.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } they're much, much better constructed down south than they are up north too.	24
I'm not sure if, if our state inspection ever-, -	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } <laughter>, -	26
Right.	15
have you ever served as a juror?	7
Bye-bye.	38
{C so } {F um, } <laughter> {D you know, } [ I, + I ] wonder sometimes if he knows what he's doing.	24
It's probably my all time, -	24
{F Um. }	26
{C So, } I guess I view it as being the prime importance as far as -- -- [ trying to negotiate, + trying to ] wind down some of the tensions and everything that are there.	9
<Laughter> {C And } the Moody Blues,	24
they didn't ask that, but they're talking about college teams,	24
we'd like to do a float trip down, {F uh, } {F oh, } like Big Bend area or something like  that.	24
{C but } I like to fish	24
-- [ {C but, } + {F uh, } {C so } ]  this, {F uh, } French I guess are into the slapsti-,	9
Go ahead.	18
[ I, + I ] don't think it ever will really.	9
it's big,	9
It's funny now,	9
Where do you all live?	39
Yeah.	15
{C So } this has worked out real nicely.	24
{F Oh, } yes.	15
{D So, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{F Um. }	26
{C but } I know it has been successful.	24
Yeah.	15
{C And } they were having problems with too many goldfish because we had put some goldfish in,	24
Yeah,	15
{E I mean, } I've been doing this for fifteen, twenty years.	24
{F Oh, } no.	21
How about where you live there in Utah?	31
{C and, }  {F uh, } as a  say, [ I, + I ] tend to be around, {F uh, } civil cases  because I've been an expert witness some, -	24
{F Oh, } uh-huh,	15
No,	33
Oh.	15
yeah,	26
{C and, } on the other hand, {D you know, } people are saying that [ because the, + [ he knows, + ] because the ] criminals know that the, {F uh, } penalties can be very severe,	24
<Breathing> {F Uh, } his name is T Q or something like that.	24
{C but } it's very long.	24
I don't think anyone does, in fact.	9
do you sing [ in, + in ]  a choir or a choral group?	7
Uh-huh.	15
[ That's, + that couldn't be ] too far from you, neither.	9
I believe it is,	24
Yes,	36
Yeah,	36
It looked dark.	24
That doesn't always work.	2
There you go.	36
<Laughter>.	20
I've talked to my mother  about that several times lately,	24
In Richardson.	24
I don't know, -	19
{C so }  they have their own adaptation of what Italian is.   {E I mean, }	24
{C or } people can drop their used news papers and other papers in the bins	24
That's generally our usual summer vacation.	24
By themselves I mean.	8
I'm familiar with Plano.	24
Right.	15
<sigh> suppose, {D you know, } {D like } you're a manager.	24
# Yes. #	15
Somewhat, yeah,	4
no.	13
I said you've been very nice, what's your name.	24
Okay,	15
# Right. #	15
Alright.	38
-- what you were alluding to earlier is, {D you know, } women who work for minimal # wage # -- -- [ [ an-, + and, ] +  and ] really [ have t-, + feel they have to ] put their children, -	9
{C but } we didn't get to watch it tonight.	24
{F Oh, } beautiful.	24
It seems like they last forever.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
{C and } [ it's, +  it starts ] thickening,	24
{C and, }  I'd rather spend the  time with my husband than, {D you know, } spending time, -	25
{C but, } {F um, } [ [ I, + there weren't, as I recall, ] + {E or at least } I wasn't aware of ] that many Americans there except for a very heavy concentration of Peace Corps volunteers,	24
{C and } they thought that was more beneficial because, {D you know } [ [ it, + it, ] + some of it ] does soak in	24
As long as you do not have to drive in it.	9
Steve's mom [ finally, + {F uh, } finally ] [ s-, + {D you know, } said ] [ that, + that ] God will take care of us when it's our time.	24
I married your cousin's brother's uncle or something  like that.	25
bye-bye.	38
I totally agree with that.  # {F Um. } #	36
{C and then } he embarked on this, {F uh, } vitamin treatment	24
{D well, } really,	26
{C Because } I know [ there is, + there is ]  still people even in the Dallas area.	9
Political science, {F oh, }	30
{C And then } they, -	26
it turned out to be, {F uh, } {F uh, } an invitation.	22
Yeah,	36
so. -	26
He did apply to a large, {D you know, } large group,	24
[ peop-, +  people ] just don't help people anymore.	9
Yeah,	36
{C but } yet, [ it's, + it's ] kind of tied to her the way it is now.	24
{F Uh, } {C so } I'm looking at, {F uh, } something larger than what we have.	24
Yeah.	4
Not for the price?	8
No,	33
# Uh-huh. #	15
there is a lot more women in the work place nowadays.	9
We feel like, it's our responsibility,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Okay,	21
{D You know, } I never have.	24
Right,	15
{C And then, } {F uh, } we have just totally cut down,	24
{C and } it was, {D you know, } in the seventies out here	24
I think that, {F uh, } too many, {F uh, } -	9
No,	33
{C And } that might be an extra  day to put out things that might be recycled if we had [ a, +  a ] certain  colored can to put them in or  something in the city to put, {D like } either  glass or newspapers or  whatever.	9
Now the only problem, -   *[[note the setup for a negative comment]]	24
{C and } they actually printed out maps of routes you could take so you would get maximum leaf exposure.	24
{E I mean } they might be able to,  {F ah, } say that anyone who does that, {F uh, } gets certain benefits that <throat_clearing> would not be available to someone who didn't do it.	24
They had tickets at their school that they recycle {C either } newspapers {C or } cans,	24
I would love to help somebody, {D you know, }	24
# <Laughter>. #	20
Uh-huh.	38
I ] really resented the fact that they were charging me for cards,	24
{C and } we went and took the two dogs up fishing.	24
Is there anything missing?	12
that's true.	36
{C And } you mix and match	24
We went and, {F uh, } had a, kind of a picnic in the woods type thing.	24
All righty <laughter>.	36
It is	36
{C And } I bet, -	24
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } yeah.	36
{F Oh, } my goodness.	21
Yeah,	38
Huh-uh.	15
{C but } it took every nerve in her body to say that because she's from a very, very old fashioned family.	24
# Yeah.  #	15
Just really whatever.	24
{C or } I've got my P C configured to where I can use either printer.   The one that's on  the network or my own.	24
my good friend calls them pushy,	24
{C and } [ I had, + I had ] the brakes done on it	24
{C and } it seemed to me all the time I was thinking of  all these people in the courtroom over the case that involved, {F oh, } a couple  thousand dollars I think, [ it was, +  it was ] really just,  {F uh, } {F uh, } terrific waste of everybody's time and money.	9
Uh-huh.	15
That's what I've heard, yeah.	24
{C and } we did other things.	24
[ I, + ] I will take a look at the individual score, {D you know, } in the individual stance in the N B A --	24
{D Well, } I alternate between Danielle Steele  <laughter> is one of my very favorites	24
we didn't have anyone in town that was our family.	24
we live out by Dulles Airport.	24
{F Uh, } basically, {F uh, } I work on a campus	24
<inhaling> {F Uh, } if the hour comes and I do not get a chance to watch it, so what.	24
{F Oh, } sure.	21
Yeah,	15
# Oh. #	15
did you happen to see last night the special on Channel Two with James Galway?	7
Uh-huh.	4
{D So, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
We seem to, uh, -	9
Yeah.	15
[ I, + I ] cast a ways.	24
You have got to drive careful.	18
Yeah,	15
We, -	26
{D Well, } yeah,	15
{C and } we're to not let you do it, {D you know. }	25
{F Uh, } {C so } I guess, {D you know, } being that I come from a hunting family -- -- <Talking> I'd rather have some restrictions put on weapons but yet allow hunting rifles, {F uh, } things that people would use for sporting type of, {F uh, } a, activity.	9
[ Do you know that I've never, + I think other then accept on a commercial or  on news coverage or something, # like # entertainment tonight I've never ] seen M T V?	24
# [ {C So, } # + -- -- {C so } ] he had to have a work visa there.	24
I think it was in a Hispanic area,	9
{C but } he's very protective of our property.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
it was,  {D you know, } combination [ of, +  of,  ] {F uh, } both activities [ and, +  {F uh, } and ]  using too	24
that's true.	36
{C But } in a way, I really do,	26
Huh-uh <laughter>.	15
Yeah	15
# {E I mean, } [ I'd like, + # I'd like ] to know that my child's being taught by a teacher who's not on drugs [ or, + # or, ] {F uh, } # who might be at a point where they're trying to sell my kid drugs.	9
{C and } even if [ I, + I ] really wish I knew the situations they were going back to or coming from.	24
# {F Uh, } #    *[[slash error]] Right.	26
He came and did it that way	24
Uh-huh.	15
No,	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C So, } -	26
[ it, + it's ] a little bit difficult, though.	24
{E I mean, } everybody's pitched in	24
{C and } for the first time in my life.  I am starting to feel like [ I, + I. ] -	24
Yeah,	15
{C Because } I guess, everywhere I read that there is a shortage of judges.	24
Yeah, {D you know. }	15
see the inside of them or whatever.	22
<Laughter>.	20
I haven't heard of anybody that's read it, either.	24
Yeah,	15
# I # decided I didn't want to waste the time	24
{C And } basically, {F um, } the choices,  {E I mean, } {D you know, }	26
{C And, }  the plots are more, {F um, } challenging, {D you know, } than the sitcoms of regular T V.	9
That, {F uh, } [ you can't, + you can't ] have it any other way.	9
Brigham Young.	8
{C but, }  {F uh, } [ I, + I ]  keep hearing all the stories [ of, + of ] different parts of town.	24
Right.	15
that makes a difference when you have somebody to go with and to do the same the same thing.	9
Yeah.	30
<Laughter>.	20
they have the long sleeve shirts and the whole tie and the whole suit,	24
{F Uh, } nobody in my family hunted,	24
-- {C and } they sent somebody in,	24
the ones I knew, {D you know, } always chose the Red Cross, because they didn't do anything --	24
They just get around [ and, +  and ] talk techy  [ or, + or ] else, {F uh, } {F uh, } {D you know, } -	24
Right.	15
Yeah,	15
I live [ wi-, + on ] the border.	24
Uh-huh.	15
they are.	24
{D Well, } for example.  In Greek there are seven different words for love.	24
{F Um. } Yeah.	26
{D well, } yeah	36
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] they shed some light on what was going on for me.	24
if you just let it dry, it dries kind of  like, {F uh, } -	24
{D well } [ I, +  I ]  have a dog that God gave us too, <laughter>.	24
[ That's, + that's ]  one important thing that I think about school.	9
it just, -	26
{C but } I noticed in one of the sales catalogs this weekend they have [ [ a, + {D like } a, ] + a ] clothes hamper kind of thing that, {D you know, } you lay your string in, then you put your papers in there -- -- tie them all up and bundle them up,	24
{C And } [ that was, + {F uh, } that was ] pretty good	24
[ I, + I ] can walk the streets.	24
{C and so } my daughter first looked at a place that was forty thousand,	24
there's three of us, {F uh, } facilities' managers are covering the off shifts.  Just to have somebody here, {F uh, } from management to, {F uh, } see if they need anything.	24
-- I've never seen you before <laughter>.	24
[ we'll + I'll ] talk to you.	38
# Uh-huh. #	15
Right.	15
Okay.	38
[ I'm, +  I'm ]  not sure [ that, +  {F um, } that ] they're ready to get rid [ of, +  of, ] {F uh, } Tom Grieve yet,	24
{C because, } {F uh, } I drive out of town a lot of the weekends --	24
Orlando is the only place I've ever been where I've seen the car sweat.	24
{C So } <breathing> {F um, } it's just, {F um, }  very critical, I think at this point to, {F uh, } get that through to the people and get us educated.	9
I love it.	24
Right.	15
I don't play an instrument.	24
{E I mean, } they tax American imports quite heavily.	9
{F Um, } {F um, } {C and } I don't think  this would have anything to do with it,	19
Yeah,	36
Yes.	15
I don't think I do either	24
Then they have to negotiate almost everything	9
Yeah,	30
he's part Collie, part Shepherd, and part Chow. # More Collie # and Shepherd than Chow,	24
# {C And } # the [ long, + long-range ]  views [ are, + are ] just kind of, become a thing of the past.	9
I have never been there	24
yeah,	15
-- {F uh, }  he's in his sixties,	24
now, I'm in college	24
[ [  I, + I, ] + I ] don't even know, {F uh, } who has been winning [ in, + ] {F uh, } as far as the, {F uh, } San Francisco Giants and the Oakland A -s	24
Yeah.	36
yeah,	26
[ [ [ it's, + it's a, ] + it's a, ] + it's a ]  machine,	24
yeah,	36
{C and } it's kind of embarrassing.	24
{F Uh, }  that was a engineering spec on B two.	24
it works,	36
I don't think that's right.	24
They initially start out in the barnyard kind of setting where they're raised.	24
{C but } I would imagine it's very hard.	24
# Right,	36
We sell the paper back [ to the, + {F uh, } to a ] paper manufacturing company.	24
they, -	26
Uh-huh,	36
I think, we've given them about seven minutes according to my watch	24
{D Well, } [ you have, + you have ] a lot of vacation  areas you can go to <laughter> then.	9
That's true.	36
Yes,	4
Yep.	15
Yeah.	15
No,	33
{C but } I wish I could put a stop to it,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } they couldn't put two and two together as far as the law was concerned.	9
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] you're right,	9
when  (( Ricky ))  and (( Carrie )) came over we made, {F um, } a pot roast with rice and gravy and salad and the whole bit.	24
We'll see you,	38
Excuse me?	14
{C And } supposedly that  facility will not generate air pollutants from what I've heard, that everything would be [ in, + in, ] {D you know, }  [ a + ] confined kind of incinerator and just burn it all up.	24
Right.	36
the European countries certainly, {F uh, } none of them have capital punishment	24
Yeah <Door>.	4
What's that going to be like.	16
{C and } it's in a case,	24
Uh-huh.	26
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } maybe, {D well, } [ as, + as ] you say, the care [ of, + of ] grandmother [ or + ] [ was, + was ] just such that such mom and dad couldn't handle it.	24
Yeah.	36
{C but } never did it.	24
{D Well, } yeah,	15
{C So } this was one thing that we, {F um, } weren't able to do this year,	24
{C and } also, {F uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, } we were, {F uh, } ostracized by his family, {F uh, } basically [ just, +   {D you know, } {F uh, } we just ] kind of dropped off the face of the earth.	24
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } yes.	4
{E I mean } -- -- it's a lot of trouble [ to, + to ] take care of that.	9
{F Oh } yeah,	15
one of the new ones.	24
Right.	15
Bye-bye.	38
Yeah. #	15
{F Oh, } God, {F oh } <laughter>.	21
No.	33
{C but } I think [ [ [ that's + that's ] + {F uh } it's ] + that's ] taxpayer's money. <breathing>	9
Uh-huh.	15
{D So, } -	26
I'm sure it's a very expensive program to administer.	9
A lifelong job security	2
{D Well, } yeah,	4
it snowed that much in Denver {D you know }	24
I don't know,	19
can you hold on just for a second?	7
<Laughter>.	20
{C and } one's at home, gets dozen calls a night.	24
{C But, } {F uh, } [ {D see, } +  {D see } ] what else can I say about the weather.	1
Again [ one of our + -- -- one of our ] problems is that, {F uh, }  our legislature and the state and our national congress, the majority of the members thereof are lawyers.	9
I don't know.	19
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } [ I, + we ] talk about it,	24
{C and } there's other savings plans or other things that you can do.	24
Otherwise [ you can, + {F uh, } <lipsmack> guess you can ] [ [ put, + also put money, ] + hold money ] back and then either use or lose it {A and that doesn't get taxed } or can just have that money, {D you know, } put in your paycheck.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } I like Jeffrey Archer.	24
{E I mean, } it's amazing the money that they spend once they get in.	9
every once in a while I play tennis,	24
-- [ {C and, } + {C and } ] occasionally you can  watch for it and get it on sale,	24
I think that the corporations should, {F uh, } do all that.	9
Uh-huh.	15
-- {C and } {C so } [ he, + we  ] have a lot of family here, his side of the family.	24
[ that's, + that's ] probably enough.	9
{C and } after that, you have to be out in the real world and have to be able to support yourself --	9
[ [ I'm, + I'm kind of, ] + I'm ] not sure about him this year.	24
{C And, }  it was incredible, {E I mean, } the parallel, {D you know, } between it and rap.	24
Oh <laughter>.	24
<smack> {D Well, } {F uh, } <smack> we also have five children.	24
Yeah.	15
Right.	15
{F uh, } that's my other complaint.	24
but it, it doesn't seem to.	9
[ {C and } + -- -- {C and, } ]  {F uh, } [ get, + they get ]  donations from the community, {D you know, }  [ they're real, + ] And from corporations [ around the, + around the ]  city, {D you know, } for AIDS research and that kind of thing	24
[ that's the, + that's the ] in thing.	9
We'll go somewhere else.	22
{D You know, } [ they, + they ] will allow you to, -	24
yeah.	15
# I'll be darned. #	21
{C so, } {F um, } that was the instrument both of my children started on,	24
{C And } is it, {F um, } a natural gas and, -	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
Yeah,	15
# Right.	15
{F Huh. } {D Well, } that's great,	21
{C and } it seems like  everybody stopped	24
{C and } they wonder why kids turn out the way they do nowadays <laughter>.	9
{D well } go ahead.	18
{C And, } uh-huh.	4
{C but } now, my wife and I both work	24
{C And, }  {F um, } I think it would be, -	26
Right.	15
Uh-huh,	15
Yeah.	15
Right,	36
{C And } the news, too, it just doesn't, {F um, }  cover that many stories,	9
Yeah,	15
{C And } other than that, I can't think of any other ideas.	24
{F Oh, } I know.	36
Uh-huh.	15
uh-huh.	36
{C so, } -	26
{C and } the idea, do we go out and  feed these people when they're hungry.	16
It was real different then you'd expect, #	9
Yeah,	30
Right.	15
{D Well, } [ I think, + I think ] a lot of people, {D you know, } kind of felt that way,	9
The, uh, temperature this morning was right at freezing.	24
they come and pick up your newspapers if you have them bundled up.	24
{F Oh, } I love  home [ gro-, + grown ] tomatos.	21
Uh-huh.	15
[ Does, + does ] your dad have horses there?	7
we have this pie crust recipe in our family <children> that my grandmother gave my mother	24
-- {C and } I make the clothes for them.	24
{C and } a  lot of people in our su-, -	24
How do they get along together?	39
[ We, + we ] tend to run them up to the maximum and then ask for more.	24
right next to Dulles.	24
Oh, no.  <laughter>	21
Okay.  #	38
{D well } it's been good talking to you.	38
all the ones I know,	24
I'd love to get used to that shotgun.	24
No.	33
{C but } the, {F uh, } -	26
You don't know that, {F uh, } {D you know } <laughter>.	24
{C So } we have to, {F uh, } face that reality also.	9
-- put in garlic and onion powder -- -- or chopped onions if you want to do that, {D you know. }   What ever, however much effort you feel like putting into it.	18
{D Well, } it was good talking to you too.	38
They don't use any of those services that a lot of the taxes go towards.	9
yeah,	26
I'll put the eggs in the same dish and beat them up and then pour the cornstarch  and the milk mixture in the egg.	24
That's good.	21
{D Well } <breathing>, [ we moved in, + when we moved in,  ] [ there, + there ] wasn't any outside lights	24
((   ))  Capital punishment, {F uh, } I guess, out in California [ is, + has ] had [ a lot of, + {F uh, } a lot of, ] {D you know, } discourse in the paper.	24
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] there's so much broth and juice in there, # that it # has to, {F uh, } soak up into the rice, all day long, in order for it [ to, + {F uh, } {F uh, } to ] come out fluffy [ and, + and ] nice.	24
{C but } I think the technology is better.	9
{C but } [ [ the, + {D you know, } the, ] + the ] problem is not <breathing> so much with the prison system, {D you know, }	9
Right	15
Uh-huh,	36
[ {C And, } + {C but } ] they have two children, too,	24
I see <laughter>.	21
{F Uh, } not every morning, {F uh, }	5
{F Oh, } <laughter> okay.	29
{C And then } it was just like -- -- I forgot all about it.	24
Uh-huh.	4
{C But, } {F uh, }  {D well } keep up the good, {F um, }	38
we  come from a, -	26
I  thought [ they got, + you got ] called back if you tested positive, for more tests.	9
{C and then } we can throw in some highway bill,	25
Right,	36
I live in Waco, {D okay, }	24
-- {F uh, } right,	36
{D So, } {C and, } my wife played flute in high school.	24
{D well } [ the, + the ] results, -	26
<<Very faint>> Yeah.	15
No.	33
it was really good.	9
{C or, } -	26
<Laughter>.	20
We had, -	26
<swallowing> And they do enjoy it.	9
[ I, + I ] tried to make calls two different days	24
{C but. } -	26
Other than, {D you know, } taking your shoes  off right before you walk in or  something [ and, + and ]  sweeping it out everyday, it's really hard [ to, + to ] keep the sand and dirt out of it.	9
I agree with you there.	36
<Laughter>.	20
{C and, } {F uh, } I started out basically camping [ when I was, + when I was ] in Boy Scouts,	24
I guess it's always [ not, + not ] being able to picture one more,	9
{C but } the basic idea, it was presented to him was how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff that we are putting into our landfill --	24
<<Whispering>> I know it <<regular voice>>.	21
# It worked out well. #	24
{C and } I weigh probably about the same I weighed for, {F oh, } I don't know how many years,	24
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
There are certain kinds I like and certain kinds I don't.	24
<Laughter>.	20
[ [ I, + I ] saw, + I see ]  that a lot too, there.	24
Really?	12
is our five minutes up?	7
{E I mean, } it's only been, three months or something like that -- -- since that happened	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
Yeah,	15
{F Huh. }	15
{C And } [ I just, + {F uh, } he ] lives with different, {D you know, } people in the family.	24
A friend of mine, always pushing me.	24
{C but } I hate it when I'm doing it.	24
yeah,	26
{C And } that is an invasion of privacy,	9
<sniffing>  I don't know,	19
{C and } they're real good with their appliance and stuff like that	9
She did pretty well after a while.	24
{C So, } I've worked for them for several years, {D like } twelve now, I guess.	24
I wanted them to learn to play I didn't academics forced on them at an early age.	24
{C and } you go  (( down ))  through	24
that's not their problem,	9
Yeah.	15
[ I, + I ] have gone on one little vacation, just the girls and I.	24
That's right.	36
{C but, } -	26
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
Hi.	6
NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR there are  {D like } three big continents	24
probably more of them then the other way around <laughter>.	9
{D Well } I'd say tackle one project first and see how it goes	18
Yeah.	15
# Yeah	15
You want it to get dry, but not, {F uh, } just real hard.	18
{C Because, } {E I mean, } gee whiz, if I [ was, + ] {F uh, } {F uh, } didn't have that right, {D you know, } not to have a jury that, {F oh } -	9
{F Oh, } jeez.	21
{D Well, } [ do you, + {F um, } are you ] working for T I?	7
Right.	15
-- {C and } [ he, + he ] has now for about, oh gosh, how long has it been, ten years I guess.	24
I didn't really need power windows, but it has power, {D you know, } windows -- -- and steering and air conditioning,	24
Thank you for calling.	38
Right.	36
we have camped with some friends who have young children	24
<<Talks to baby>> Just a minute,	10
{F Oh, } {F uh, } {D well, } I read for a living.	24
[ I'm, + I ]  need to get, -	24
{C And } I'd like to see athletes, {F uh, } or fellow students, like myself, {D you know, } [ to + ] play the game.	24
it's gone.	24
{C So } it's <laughter>, -	26
{C and } they're almost on the verge of saying that [ you, + ]  if you're going to draft men, you're going to have to draft women.	24
This is very true.	36
Doesn't that always taste so much better, # when you're out like that.	8
wherever the area, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
[ I do not like it, + {D you know. }  I just like ] [ a baked, + {D you know, } a piece ] of chicken	24
One was under warranty,	24
<Laughter>.	20
-- {C and, } we just love it,	24
{C And, } -	26
{D Well, } is the crime that bad there in Atlanta?	7
Are you in Plano?	7
And even debates don't seem to help much.	9
I remember I saw him in a huge stadium in, {F uh, } Philadelphia.	24
{C and } she says, why haven't you read that.	24
{E I mean, } they said they would give it out to only select  companies	24
[ I'm, + I'm ] a transplant.	24
{C And } that made you even feel a little more kin [ to, + <laughter> to ] what was going on.	9
Right.	15
{D So } we took those back,	24
# {F uh, } {C because } I'm a single # parent,	24
I think so	36
you're [ prob-, + probably ] right,	36
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } it's great afterwards,	9
It seems to help the new mothers -- -- # not have to come # back full-time.	9
so it must be for a different year,	24
Right,	36
{C and, } -	26
An English setter, {D you know, }	24
He's never had anything but skim milk	24
Right.	15
{C and } they had a living room, and a bedroom and a kitchen, and a bathroom.	24
Sometimes it just sits around for a while,	24
{F um, } have you ever been involved in any trials?	7
Usually, [ the, + the ] person ordering doesn't pay.	24
{F Uh, } it seems like ten o'clock at night <laughter>.	24
{C So } [ we are never, + we never ] cheer against  Denver unless they're playing the Cowboys.	24
{D So, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } [ that, + that's ] always a smile.	24
[ it's + ] bad because if [ you, +  {D you know, } your ] bill is due on the fifteenth -- -- then [ i-, + ] [ [ [ [ y-, + y-, ] + y-, ] + you-, ] + you're ] not past due until the fifteenth of the next month.	24
Uh-huh,	15
{F Um. }	26
{C and } there's a notion of fairness.	9
this is not just for working women	24
<throat_clearing> # {E I mean } # ... -	26
okay,	15
yeah,	26
Yeah.	4
I've never used my Visa for cash before.	24
For example, that one, {F uh, } positive would not be, {F uh, } accepted as an automatic, {F um, } reason for whatever they might be going, to do if they found a positive, {F uh, } dismissal or treatment or whatever,  {C but } [ that, + that ] what it would do is it would trigger, perhaps, {F uh, } one or two more stages where further tests could be [ ta-, + ] {F uh, } done.	9
{C and } -- -- we wanted to be able to go in and have our teeth cleaned and just checked all over	26
Just people are, of course,  populations getting older.	9
If they'd been in day care the entire time and it wasn't, -	9
{C and } a woman asked me what that meant	24
<Laughter> {D Well, } I understand that.	21
writing checks is just as easy I guess.	9
{C And } I told him he's obviously in a high risk group <laughter>.	24
yeah.	15
{C and } that's that.	24
# Yeah.  #	15
# Uh-huh.  #	15
I believe that <laughter>.	36
Yeah --	36
But, uh, I, I don't, I don't know -	19
Uh-huh <<faint>>.	15
That's right.	36
Right.	36
{C and } sure it  [ has, + has ] the metric equivalent written on there,	9
pardon me?	15
{D Well, } I know like when I was in high school and  junior high and stuff and  sitting down and having the sex talk with mom, {D you know } -- -- and all that stuff,	24
Suppose, {F uh, } {D well, } {D you know, }  they had a group who were construction oriented	18
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } there seems to be more a mature crowd in, {F uh, } apartments, at least where I am, {F uh, } even though, {D you know, } there's kids all around	24
Yeah,	15
No I doubt it, # {D you know. }	36
They'd rather get their life started first before, -	9
{C and } the bedrooms are norm.	24
Right.	15
{C and, } -	26
<Laughter>  [ I'm, + {F uh, } I really like ] the looks also of the new Mazda -- -- that they have,	24
there's articles in the TIME magazine and all about whether it be basketball or anything else.	24
Right,	36
yeah,	15
-- {C so } my husband goes a lot	24
{D well, } I do research	24
{C and }  it was some Malaria medication	24
{C And } I said, yeah,	24
Right.	15
Yeah,	15
of course, I don't know all that about recycling	19
{D well, } get your girlfriend  to work out with you.	24
-- {F um, } especially, -	13
they interrupt at the end.	24
[ you, + you ] can either use three or  four of the threads.	24
[ I, + I ] shouldn't say I don't know if it was any worse,	24
That's good.	21
Of course.	36
it would  depend upon which one you want.	24
No,	33
{C so } you haven't done that before.	8
You see the old, {F uh, } cigarette ads, {D you know, } about you've come a long way.	8
{C So } then, you wake up one morning	9
Uh-huh.	15
[ just, it's, + it's ] nothing serious about it at all.	24
Yeah.	15
you just -- -- take off your mortgage interest --	9
[ You, +  you ] think the benefit would be greater than the, -	8
that was a great deal for him.	9
[ [ their, + {D you know, } he got, ] + he's ] in trouble again down in Houston	24
{C and } he went on a fairly strict diet to try to get it down.  And did!	24
I don't think they should show it during prime time,	9
{D So, } [ I wa-, + {D you know, } I enjoy ] kids	24
# Yeah.  #	15
Yeah.	15
{C and } that is  that -	26
Absolutely.	15
I'm sure you've seen some interesting developments in acoustics.	8
{D So. }	26
you could rent it -- -- [ more than onc-, -- + -- more than four ] times and watch that.	9
She said they couldn't see those things out there, because of the smog and everything.	24
Right,	15
{D like } the WONDER YEARS, {E [ I, + I ] mean, } it's kind of risque stuff  [ for, + maybe for  ] teenagers,	9
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } okay,	29
What are dialing services?	39
Yeah,	36
{F Oh } yeah,	4
{D Well, } that's amazing,	21
<Laughter> I've tried it -- -- once,	24
I  do it to taste.	24
It's # pretty tough.	9
{D So } do you like,  {F um, } movies a lot?	7
-- {D see } I don't know if that's [ a, +  the ] movie of the week [ or, + or ] what,	24
{C and } [ I  haven't, + I haven't ] started  making money yet.	24
{F Oh, } [ I think, + I think ] it's just a crying  shame, {F uh, } for a mother to have to go back to work at six weeks.	9
[ {C and, } + {C and  then } ] they sell,	24
Yeah.	15
{F uh, } Bertinelli, or what's her name.	24
{C So } [ that's, +  that's ] a very good  place to eat, The Blue Mesa Grill.	24
They've tak-, -	26
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
# {F Oh, } yeah.	15
{D Well, } I guarantee [  you, + you'd ] be paying a lot more in taxes [ i-, + if, ]  {F uh, } the Democrats had more say.	9
Yeah.	15
{C So } it kind of [ [ ac-, + i-, ] + kept ] them, -	24
Many times worse, because of course, it's a tree.	9
Yeah,	15
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] yes,	26
Right.	15
That's right,	36
# {F Oh, } wow.  #	21
I'm in Maryland.	24
When you get one way out like that <breathing> -	24
Yeah,	15
-- {C so } they say that's really a bad thing.  That you need to learn a lot of ways [ to, + to  ] deal with that and get [ your, + <noise> your  ] time in between things.	24
{C and } there was a lot  of human character there,	9
right,	11
{E I mean, } you can say that about Africa too.	24
{C and } the other is two and a half.	24
they do,	11
Oh  ((   )) .	15
[ Hope-, + hopefully, ] it's not my wife.	24
# {C and } # we really did well.	24
<Laughter>.	20
# {D You know, } # {C and then, } {F uh, } they also give you, they say cash back, {F uh, } {D like } at the end of the year.	24
{F Oh, } that will be fun, too.	9
I guess [ a lot of + it's still a lot of ] hype.	9
# sure.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } you're not a starving artist, yet, are you?	7
{C But } they like to, {F uh, } spend time with me.	24
{C and } everything looks real	24
we both grew up with single mothers.	24
Hi.	6
{C And } then I really liked it.	24
{C and } it's really moist.	24
Yeah,	36
[ I, +  I ] wish there was some way that we could change the news media so they didn't feature  these way out stories.	9
Right.	15
{C and, } {D you know, } [ it's, +  it's ] still pretty rural.	24
{C and } I was absolutely flabbergasted at the, -	24
I do.	5
{C or, }  it's mostly the private information that we're all concerned about.	9
they almost take all emotions out of it when they -- -- report it	9
{C So, }  you don't, -	26
{C but } the language in it is just for no reason, has to stick in, -	24
It'll be comfortable.	9
Okay.	29
<laughter>.	20
Yeah,	15
{C And } I've known several engineers that got laid off	24
Yeah,	15
<<Very faint>> Uh-huh.	15
that doesn't have any color,	24
It might be handy,	9
Uh-huh.	15
very much so,	11
you can't really  be sure of the quality of what you've got, {D you know. }	9
[ I, + I ] just thought that was so neat, that they got him over that hump.	24
{D You know, } because <breathing>  I know so many people, here that have been killed in head on collisions, where maybe  if they [ had, +  had ] [ that, +  that ] -- -- air bag, they may still be walking around.	24
{F Um, } [ {C and, } + {C and } ] yet, I know that, {F uh, } some of the stores will actually help the community, not pay you the money back, but will pay [ the, +  the, ] {F uh, } community, like through the schools -- -- or things like that.	24
# Okay. #	15
{C and } trees are supposed to, {D you know, } purify.	9
It certainly is,	36
His name is Wolf Blitzer.	24
Yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
{D You know, } the Israelis can do anything they want	24
{D See, } these are refujees, you  mean?	7
{C and } every year everyone asks -- -- when is it happening and where is it happening --	24
I had a, {F uh, } Dodge pickup several years ago,	24
{D like } they still get their allowance,	24
# True. #	36
{C and } finally, boom <laughter>.	24
{C or, } {F uh, } {D you know, } there some people that are actually music majors.	24
a lot of states don't have a, {F uh, } inspection law	24
[ I, + I, ] {F uh, } -	26
{C but, } -	26
Yeah,	36
{C and } I, -	26
<<faint>>.	20
{C but } [ it's not, + it's not ] what I want to spend it on, {D you know. }	24
{C and } I wonder how they're going to analyze them.  Whether it would be listening to them or analyzing,	24
Yes.	36
No	33
# Okay,	26
I despise -- -- franchised restaurants.	24
{C and } he thinks that would be good for the kids <laughter>.	24
{C but } I've also seen the other side of it, too.	24
Yeah.	26
{D like } one of my favorite shows used to be HAPPY DAYS --	24
{D Well } {D now } the reason that I said that is because I was going to blame all, {F uh, } Reaganomics for, {D you know, } -	24
when you're too old to do anything else -- -- go play golf,	9
Yeah,	15
# {F Uh. }  # # <Laughter>.  #	15
What do you think's going to happen there.	31
{D well, } [ they're, + {F um, } {D you know, } they're ] like Ber-, -	24
Yeah.	15
<Laughter> Yeah	15
Do you know it was on radio now?	7
{C but } [ that's, + I think that's ] a good magazine.	9
[ [ My, + my, ] + yeah,	26
{C and } I remember  when we went <laughter>, # we # were married with another couple  that was just dating	24
{C but } it surrounds a man-made reservoir	24
The local doesn't either	24
# <Laughter>  Yeah. #	15
{C but, } {F uh, } [ I've, + I've ] had considerable experience.	24
he's very good.	9
{C But } it seems to me that there are ways to accommodate that.  {F Um, }	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
<Laughter>.	20
{C and so } I kind of stay a-, -	24
<Sigh> I won a dollar <laughter>.	24
I know that I'd be worried, too.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
{C and so. } It's just that you have to always  compete	9
it gives me a paycheck, {D you know, }	24
Where?	14
{C and } she uses it to compose and print out letters.	24
{C But, } {F um. } -	26
{C But, } it doesn't happen very often,	24
Uh-huh,	15
{F Uh, } there's an annual membership fee, {F uh, } [ that's, + that's ] fairly high.	24
<Noise>.	20
{C and } they play the same sort of thing over and over again, without really necessarily quality.	24
{C but } she has chocolate, {F uh, } paws, chocolate stomach and silver on her hindquarters.	24
We keep a large plastic, {F uh, } [ [ just a, + {D you know, } a ] + ] garbage bag in the garage.	24
# Wasn't the same. #	2
{F Um, } {C but } I was  ((   ))  to say on Saturdays there is absolutely nothing	9
<Laughter>.	20
they said, -	26
Um-hum.	15
{C but } if I walk for  more than fifteen minutes it's going to bother # me. #	24
A Volvo, being a four cylinder is  very easy to work on.	24
I just went and bought a Honda, {E I mean, } [ I didn't even, +  I didn't ] look around or anything I just said that this is what I  want, <laughter>,	24
you [ can't, + don't ] have hand gestures and things like that.	9
One of our other real problems with going out to eat, Sunday morning brunches.	24
they just slide it in there and pass it back to you -- -- {D you know, }	24
{C but, } {F uh, } it  has quieted down,	24
I miss it <laughter>.	24
{C but } the reward ultimately comes down to what you want.	9
{C and } -- -- some of them require me to go out of town,	24
{D Well, } what about random testing, though.	28
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
My husband's mother will have major surgery	24
I know,	36
# Uh-huh. #	15
{C But } it might be interesting to  see what would happen if you took kids [ at a, + ]   and then took then to another country instead   of having being exposed to all the drugs and violence and sex <laughter> and  everything here, and take them to some other country that had different moral   values <laughter>, like Saudi Arabia where they couldn't drink <laughter>.	9
Sure.	15
Right.	15
The blooms are, on some of them is yellow, purple, white.  Just all different colors.	24
[ I, +  I ] can't see communism in that country carrying on past him.	9
{C so } [ I don't have, + {D you know, } I don't know ] that much about it,	24
# Just # -- -- {D you know, } put up the money.	24
Uh-huh.	15
That's a lot of work.	21
<Laughter> Yeah,	36
Oh.	15
{C but } the, the prescription has run out you still had some left	24
{E I mean, } [ I, + I ] like all ranges of movies,	24
{C So } you've been fairly happy with it.	22
Uh-huh.	15
[ I also, + I ] was impressed [ by, + {F uh, } by ] the Mercedes, too.	24
[ she alw-, + she always ] grows, {D you know, } five different varieties,	24
{F Oh, } yeah,	36
Right,	36
Right.	15
# {C but } # it needed -	24
# That # you are going to let them make.	8
Yeah.	15
Course, -	26
{C and, } {F uh, } [ they, + they ] just love it,	24
I have heard someone else, {F uh, } say that, {F uh, } the Canadian health insurance is absolutely excellent --	24
# basically be me working to pay # for them to be at a day care, # center. #	24
{C and, } {F uh, } keep your mind off of negative things.	18
Yeah,	15
I said, No, turkey is only for Thanksgiving.	24
people, {D you know, } -	26
-- yeah,	36
-- [ {C and, } + {F uh } -- -- {C so } ] it didn't take me long to take them out of that place --	24
[ Whenever, +  the first time ] I voted, I never voted in high school because there was never anyone that showed us how to # use the # -- -- voting machines,	24
yeah,	36
{C And,} of course, those people are very avid.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } there's some days [ it's just +   {D like } it's ] the hardest thing in the world [ to, +  to ] get started.	24
{D Well } at least it's fruit and stuff there <laughter>.	24
{C and } it starts up --	24
[ it's, + it's, ] {F um, } {F um, } {F um, } -	26
{C But, } {F uh, } one, {D you know, } -	26
{C But } he jumped [ in, + in ] [ the, + the ] river.	24
{C and } [ the, +  {D you know, } the ] thought that [ I, +  I ] see [ the, + {F uh, } the ] mall rats,  {D you know, } walking around the mall, nothing better to do than just walk around the mall  all day long, when they could be doing something to help someone. -	9
Yeah,	36
{F Uh, } {F Uh, } I saw it, {F uh, }	24
Yow.	21
{E I mean, } [[ you + -- -- I, ] + I ] think people tend to think that the government is not corrupt <laughter>. And that people aren't self serving.	9
{C And, }  {F uh, } if it does the job, then [ that's, + that's ] what you need.	9
{C but } I don't know if they play, # in the same # location.	24
{C so } {D like, }  that took like a minute --	24
Detroit,	24
{C and, } # I think that is probably what happened  in our house	24
I know it,	36
Uh-huh.	15
I think the person who really may be  at this time has a hard road to tow is Jordan's King Hussein because he [ really kind of, + really tried to kind of ]  straddle the fence.	9
{C and then } I make it,	24
No.	36
{C But } I put it on hot and also melted it.	24
{C And } that book, have you ever read that book? INVISIBLE MAN.	7
-- that was wild <child_talking>.	9
{C but } I'm not real sure what it's about.	24
not really.	24
{F uh, } {D now } maybe they just sort it after they get it and throw out what they can't use,	24
I've got two babies, so, I don't,	24
Yeah.	36
{C but } -- -- I have an old car which I doubt [ would, + {F uh, } would,  ] {F uh, } pass the inspection, a seventy-six,	24
{C Or, } -	26
{C And so } he's getting that	24
<Laughter>.	20
{F Oh, } it sure does do that.	36
{C and } they were keeping him from recess	24
{C And, } <noise> I don't know, <child_talking>	19
Yeah,	36
{D You know, } the bourgeoisie   [ [ was, + was, ] + was  ] [ definitely + ] out of, {F uh, } style, then.	24
{F Oh, } okay,	29
Uh-huh.	15
{C and, }  {F uh, } {D you know, }  [ they're going, + [ I, + I ] think they're going ] for an all time record of how many [ l-, + {D you know, }  losses ] in a row <laughter> [ [ they can, + they c-, ] + they can, ] {F uh, } pull out.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Um, } {C but, } I had lived in my  own little bubble up until that time,	24
I guess it is possible to have a false <baby> positive report.	9
{C but } outside of that, no.	24
yeah.	4
They've not really given it attention either,	22
Trinity,	30
{D Well, } do you drink soda and such in aluminum cans?	7
{C and } I know [ that + ] <squeak> about how they take care of that sort, # of thing.	24
# {F Um, } # {C and } [ I always, +  that always ]  bothered me	24
he was so excited about going.	24
{F Uh, } yeah,	4
{F Oh, } {D well, } yeah,	36
{F Oh, } that makes sense.	21
{C So } you see people who are severely  injured, very, very badly, lose control of body functions --	24
# No,	15
{F Uh, } {C because } I have [ a, + an ] economy car right now, which is okay,	24
being, -	26
{F Um, } most of them have pretty good facilities.	24
Yeah,	30
{C and, } -	26
This is shorts, {D you know. }	25
sure.	15
# Okay. #	38
{C and so } I'm into computers all the time.	24
No,	33
Uh-huh.	15
# {F Oh, } that's, # wonderful.	21
Did, -	26
{D Well, } around there you can probably wear, {F uh, } T-shirts and  other things,	9
[ {C or, } +  {C or } ]  get, -	26
{C and } we, -	26
{C so, }  {D you know, } I was <laughter>, -	26
{D You know, } where I use to work we had what we called tree boxes.	24
No,	33
{C but } every morning I use this President's, {F uh, } council of physical  fitness	24
[ las-, time, + last time ] I went to the Cowboys game was  during that, {F um, } N F L strike, or [ the, +  when they had the ] scab [ team, + teams ] in there,	24
[ I, # +   *[[slash error]] I ] see.   *[[slash error]]	13
{C but } on the on the other hand the alternatives aren't to great either <laughter>.	9
Oh.	15
[ you were, + you were ] tested for drugs as [ you got into T, + [ as, + as ] you got into T I? ]	7
<Laughter>.	20
{C And } [ there's, + they're ] starting to get a little bit different, {F um, }	24
{D You know, } {D like } it's easier for you to go to and run a program, {D you know, } through the disk, because, {F um, } the grader can do it at home.	9
Okay.	13
It was a very close game, and hard fought game.	24
{C and then } you'll get one <laughter>.	9
<Laughter>.	20
{C and } now, I think he barely makes it.	24
{D Well } when they [ meant, +  said ] [ the, + the ]  topic, {D you know, } of what's wrong with the public schools, [ my, +  my ] first [ im-, +  impulse ]   was <<pause>> it isn't really what's wrong with the [ public, +  public ]  schools.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, } [ I think I know who you're ta-, + {F oh, } I know who you're talking  ] about,	24
{F Oh } yeah.	15
{F Um, } what kind of hobbies do you have?	39
Oh.	29
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
{C And } I guess I see that [ as, + as ] not so much a demand  [ but, + but ] a privilege.	24
There was a couple of others that are out,	24
# {D Well, } I don't believe in a single #  government or a single control for the world.	24
what winds up happening is, for instance having kids, {D you know, }  they wind up having kids as a deduction	9
{C and } I signed up again,	24
Right.	15
you can buy [ [ the computer + the guts ] + just the guts ] with the power supply, # the # box and the mother board of a type of computer called an eighty, eighty-eight, for about two hundred dollars.	24
{F Oh, } <laughter> really?	12
I don't think there's anywhere where there isn't going to be crimes.	9
yeah.	26
who do they need to trade?	39
{F Oh, } credit cards.	24
I look at it and say thank God,	24
{C And so } [ we, + we've ] been all over	24
It's real nice.	24
((Something a little)) seating room.	24
me too.	36
Really?	12
{F Uh, } right now we're actually having, {F uh, } -	24
{F Uh } then what I usually do is I freeze them	24
You should [ fee-, + ] have a treat.	24
Mine's just a one bedroom place,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
that, -	26
you can't do it year round.	22
{F Uh, } I would say probably eighty percent of them that are caught, they're from places like up in Oklahoma, and Louisiana, Arkansas, {D you know, } across [ the, +  the ] border.	9
[ did, + did ] you use it at the car shop place.	7
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } she, -	26
Yeah.	15
{C and } they were kind of  bulky	24
{C And } [ I really think, + I really think ]  [ that, +  {F uh, } that ] they ought to, -	9
even though my dad was a Chevrolet man forever and ever and ever	24
It seems that I recall reading [ for the last + {F oh, } let's say starting three years a go but not so much in the last ] year of bank risks [ of + ] relative to the loaning funds to third world countries like Mexico, Venezuela. {F Uh, } and Argentina based on oil loans	24
{C but } she said, {F uh, } {D you know, } in prison you can get <sigh> anything.	24
Where nobody lives <laughter>.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } {D well, } of course, that's getting away from taxes isn't it,	7
that they're <noise>, -	26
{F Uh, } probably the Pirates,	24
{C And } what are you going to buy?	39
{E I mean, } [ this is, +  this is ]  [ the, +  one of the ] best inventions ever, {D you know, }	9
{C or, }  {F uh, } -	26
{C but } I didn't get that one,	24
{D You know } [ I, + I ] trust people.	24
{F Um, } he was in THE UNTOUCHABLES, too.	24
(( Sure )) .	15
Yeah,	15
I think that's a great idea,	9
{D Well, } no.	36
They've # got every type of imaginable, -	9
{C So } that's real good.	9
# Uh-huh. #	15
{C But } [ I, +  I ]  would think [ I, +  if I ] did anything, I would protect the juror [ from, +  from ]  any sort of an inquisition after <laughter>.	9
[ I, + I ] still don't think I would blame it directly on the school.	9
we'll see you in four years.	25
{C and } I -- -	26
Yes,	15
how old's  (( Kayla ))	1
I do too, especially as women get up in management  [ and, + and ] can be in on those decision making, -	24
Yeah,	15
{F Uh, } wasn't that Jane Ehre?  *[[spelling--Eyre?]]	7
bagels and lox.	24
[ I, + I ] guess maybe if they'd go and they'd ask someone in jail, {D you know, } how they can make it more fair for them or not, -	9
if they weren't out there working and having their careers -- -- they probably would be married and having their children <laughter>.	9
the only thing that I find, {D you know, }  if I would have anything against it is that it still has that soft American ride.	24
{C and then } [ they -- + -- they ] had to store the meat in, {F uh, } -	24
Yeah	15
How about you?	31
{C but, }  {F uh, } {D anyway. } -	26
most everybody seems pretty well employed around here,	24
{C And, } {F uh, } God, if your child  is not an honor student, {D well } then, <laughter> you're, something wrong with you as a parent.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Um. }	15
{C and } I haven't been.	24
# {D Well, } [ we, + we ] # eat out a good deal at this point.	24
{E I mean, } it's one thing that I, and the college knows that	24
Oh.	15
{C and so } my transportation costs have gone up by, {F uh, } five times <laughter>.	24
I. -	26
[ {C and, } + {C and } ]  you shouldn't be able to go on the lesser charge.	9
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } both times?	7
{C and } [ I wonder, +  I really do wonder ] how people do that.	24
uh-huh,	4
Right.	15
pretty, but, -	24
{C so. } -	26
[ It, + I ] don't really need a budget to tell me not to spend it.	24
{D Well, } {D you know, } I think I read about that too.	24
Yeah.	15
I would say the crimes would probably be, {D you know, } -	9
{D Well, } {D you know, } his Mom didn't go back to work until, {D you know, } when he was six months old.	24
I don't know how long it takes whether it takes five minutes or twenty minutes.	24
(( I'm not sure ))  if it was a meditation practice, or if it was, {D you know, } [ which is + ] similar to a stress management practice or alternates to, {F uh, } A M A approved medicine.	9
-- {C so } he spent all day -- -- in this one large open area,	24
I don't know if they suffer in a sense of income loss as being, since they aren't a state, whether there are monies that escape them so  to speak because they aren't able to tax like a typical state would be.	24
[ {C But, } + {F uh, } <throat_clearing> {C and so, } ] {D you know, } you go back those many years and, {F uh, } we didn't do it very much.	24
[ How, + how ] old are they?	39
# No. #	33
guess [ I, + I'm ] sympathetic with the kids,	24
Yes <<very faint>>.	15
<Laughter>  {D Well, } yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
Are you in the middle of anything?	7
{C But } I would have fried chicken, {F uh, } with reasonably hot sauce on it. Almost a Mexican type thing.	24
{C so, } {D you know, } I'm one of these, {D you know, } ten, twelve, fifteen, twenty hour a day type people.	24
Uh-huh.	15
I don't know if you've ever, -	8
{C but } I didn't know they had a four eighty-six just yet.	24
and that's probably a pretty sad thing to say	9
Yeah.	15
I didn't like that much.	24
Uh-huh.	15
I'm at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. {F Uh, } part of the Commerce Department. Here in Gaithersburg, Maryland.	24
{C but } they need to pay for it, too, because they couldn't do it somewhere else.	9
That's why I -- -- y-, {D you know, } -	26
And it's going to get worse.	9
{C And } if we're going to really do something, they ought to put that stuff out bigger for people to see it.	9
Course, then could, you know, at, at some point, could you ever convince someone to turn around and grow something that was productive for humankind.	7
-- we always just give her her purse, you know,	24
{C And } I ended up getting one that, {F uh, } came out of [ [ a, + a, ] + a ]  hunting stock -- -- because I wanted one that could still  perform like a retriever did.	24
I feel like I have, {D you know, } # because {D well, } we're just a age now,	24
he just thought I had been without a dog, {F uh, } for three years.	24
{C And } that way I feel like I'm getting, {D you know, } a thirty day loan.	24
{D Well, } [ there's three, + there's three ] pulleys that you change.	17
# H-, # -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } [ we, + I ] don't take, {D like }  TIME, or NEWSWEEK or anything like that,	5
{C and, } {D you know, } being a teacher, [ and + ] you see all these parents who are working and  working and working and just, {D you know, } don't have the [ [ [ time, + time, ] + time, ] + time. ]	24
{D You know, } that's just the home games	24
no,	17
I'll have to admit [ I kind, +  I kind ]  of went more [ to see, +  to see ] the other team a lot of times than I [ did the, +  did the ] Rangers,	24
{D You know, } {F uh, } <laughter> if you kill, you lose your life.	9
[ There's just, +  there's ] so many with this one town -- -- {D you know. }	9
{F Oh, } okay.	15
I think [ it's, + it's ] kind of interesting that everybody's so busy politicking that the question is are we getting anything good done.	9
{F Oh, } sh-, <breathing>. -	29
[ This, + ] you buy what you can afford.	9
Yeah,	15
{C and } we were trying to catch all of it,	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
their really kind of  fascinating.	24
{D Well, } {E I mean, } [ there's, + there's ] a reasonable question as to whether it's worth the amount of time it takes <laughter> to keep up on things <noise>.	9
{C so. } Everything's changed so much I probably couldn't even <laughter> get a job right now.	24
Now people are putting in bids for things and  are looking at things.	9
# [ it, + it's ]  small enough that it's easy to drive.	9
{C so. } -	26
{C but, } {D you know, } basically I went to high school and college in Ohio and  lived there <sniffing> {F uh, } more years than  I ever did in Michigan.	24
[ {C but, } + {C but } ] yeah,	26
It can benefit different people different ways.	24
it's real easy	24
# Exactly.  #	36
No,	33
their culture is so much different than ours, {D you know, }	24
I'm trying to think if there's anything else I could think of.	24
Right,	36
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } you might, {F uh, } be interested in that.	9
that's true.	9
{D Well, } we got one one year for Christmas,	24
{D You know, } it's not going to. -	9
I think maybe they'd need to be  more knowledgeable though than just your average Joe off the street -- -- for something like that  because of the cultural differences. Things like that.	9
{C And } I think that's really important.	9
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah,	36
No,	33
-- [ {C and, } +  {C but } ] we do test [ after, + ] during the assembly [ project, +  product, ] {F um, } after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag, we check to make sure it's there after we install it,	24
Uh-huh.	15
it keeps a long time.	24
{C but, } I just feel like if we didn't have those loans, we could have saved in the last five years the money for that,	24
Oh <laughter>.	15
this must be [ a, +  a ] hard category.	38
It's, {F uh, } -	26
{C and so } your canoeing kind of made me think of that.	24
I drove every year to the gulf	24
{C So } when we do go out we really, {D you know, } want to be wowed by, {F um, }  the presentation, so to speak.	24
{C and } his doctor said he needed to lose weight and exercise.	24
Yeah.	15
-- that was late,	9
Huh-uh.	15
[ [ {C and } without, + {C and, } ] +  {C and } ]  it's just they don't look at things.	9
{C and } you can display that.	24
every spring my mom says we're going to have [ a par-, + a barbecue ]  and tell everybody, guess what,	24
can you think of another thing that you guys looked at	7
{D man, } it's going to be good.	24
{C and, } {F uh, } {C but } when they quoted him a price they really wanted fifty or something.	24
Let's just get started.	18
I guess that's one thing that I particularly like, {F um. }	24
<Laughter> {D Well, } [ that is, + that's, ] [ [ the, + the, ] +   my ] little pair. {C And } my second marriage.	24
Yeah,	15
Y-, -	26
{D Well, } [ we have, + we have  ] had this one for five years now.	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } -- -- the same people usually get stuck with doing it.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } we still find it fun.	24
I guess, I, -	26
Yeah.	15
<Laughter>.	20
[  you actually, + some catamarans you can actually ] pull people behind, the skiers,	24
Yeah,	36
{C Because } one of these days I'll be getting a six seater probably too.	9
The, -	26
{C and } she was on that Kaiser Permanente --	24
you didn't work at T I?	8
{C and } I'm Brian.	24
By the time we went around it was,  {F uh, } four couples	24
What do they need cigarettes for?	16
E D P.	30
people need to take groups of children, <Laughter>  Because the kids just brighten up their lives.	9
{D Well } that sounds really good.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } there is a island in the middle --	24
[ {C or, } +  {C or } ] the Texaco Pennzoil problem, {F uh, } is ridiculous for people just  taken off the street to understand, and, really should have some better way  where people who understand both the circumstances and the complex issues involved,  should handle cases like that.	9
<Cough>.	20
-- {C and } I just couldn't get the time off to,	24
{D Well, } twenty-seven up.	24
(( )) above, uh, -	26
they have no fault in Maryland also.	24
# Yeah. #	15
That's pretty good.	21
I like it a lot, {F uh } -- -- {F uh, }	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and }  the got cross pollinated by the bees --	24
No.	33
{C But } [ I see, + I am seeing ] women now wanting to stay home -- -- more, at least until the children are up to, {D you know, } school age.	24
Are they going to be taught nothing,	16
Did they have a trial by jury for him.	7
Maybe they'll fix it.	24
I'm sure.	24
{C or, } -	26
He's small	24
he was having a kite day,	24
<Laughter>.	20
I guess we'll find out <laughter>.	24
They do it by lethal injection, # at Huntsville. #	24
Okay.	29
{E I mean, } if you don't mind reading subtitles, -	24
I do too,	36
I guess for a while I would use,  {D you know, } a variety of the Visa and  the MasterCard and the stores,	24
Yes,	36
I have a small aluminum boat here -- -- that, {F uh, } -	24
Sometimes I watch that.	24
{D Well, } that's just it,	24
Okay.	13
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } they just wrote off {D like } millions of dollars because they know they will never get it back.	24
Yeah.	15
<Talking>.	20
# {D See } [ in California they, # + In California they ] make you register when you buy ammunition.	24
# <Laughter>.  #	20
Right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{F Um, } [ our, + our ] friend has a, -	24
it's a Chinese, # {F uh, } restaurant with the lions in # the front,	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah	36
-- {C and } I think we just sort of unconsciously do it.	24
{C And } while he was gone, he had [ looked, + went ] looking for a job and stopped at the store,	24
Huh-uh.	15
{C and, }  {F um, }  I went to my exercise class one day,	24
I imagine there is a [ certain, +  certain ]  right of the press to have the ability to ask that.	9
[ I, + I ] think kids don't appreciate, maybe the value of money, that it's so little that they don't care,	9
No.	36
Really?	7
{D Like } they have this World Football League.	24
I think that's what -- -- [ goes, + {D you know, } really goes ] right now [ in the, + in the ] Dallas area.	9
they're great for playing games.	9
[ {C An, } +  {C and } ] it sounds sort of funny	9
have you, -	26
For forty dollars.	11
{C and } now that [ they, + ] the inspection systems are analyzing that, {F uh, } -	24
{D Like, } the news we don't watch, because they're boring.	9
Yeah,	36
# {C but } # when they built our section  [ they did not, + did not put ] it in	24
{D Well, } {F uh, } {C and, }  course, here's  [ this, +  this ] woman who is heavy with child dragging rocks around.	24
{C and } I get no benefits from them, ((at)) [ to + ] the part time work although, they pay better per hour -- -- than [ my, + my ] sort of, quote, real job does.	24
# How # long was the waiting period out there?	39
{C and so } that's what they did <noise>.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C but, } -	26
Yeah,	15
{C But } as far as just banning  it completely, [ there, +  that's ] not going to happen.	9
Oh.	15
{C but } still it's the principle.	9
my husband would like for me to buy another vehicle right now.	24
{C so } he could afford to get married -- -- but, is not engaged yet,	24
owns -- -	26
[ I, + I ] like the idea of juries of your peers -- -- {F uh, } in that [ [ you, + you, ] + you ] get [ more +   personally more ] than one person [ making the, + making a ] decision.	24
[ how, + how ] would you spend time with kids?	39
I've, -	26
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah <noise>.	36
{C and } the only way you're going to have a view of is this big brick wall <laughter>, {F um, }	24
Yeah.	15
{C So, } [ [ I don't, + I don't  know how to, ] + [ I don't, + I don't ] know what to ] do about it <noise>.	24
{F Oh, } my.	21
[ I did, + I did ] {D like } a research  kind of thing on AIDS research and stuff,	24
Okay.	15
{C And, then } what they did was they asked every family to write something about their family. [ And, + ] like, how many kids you had, and who you had married,	24
you can pick it up and take it wherever you go. ((   ))  any  ((   ))  space.	9
{C So, } now  have they, -	26
<Smack> No,	33
{C and } I think it's important that we  do, because, {F uh, } <smack> I notice that, {F uh, } when I had spent two years down in Dallas,  down there they all have [ a, + {F uh, } a ] me kind of attitude.	24
{C and } -- -- {D you know. } -	26
{F Uh, } <smack> right now I'm just, {F uh, } -	24
{C And, } {F uh, } I really didn't have that much of a choice because my husband was trying to finish his, {F uh, } college work -- -- and his Master's degree -- -- and so forth,	24
Uh-huh.	15
I'm watching, Janice,	10
{D Well } it's not hard to do if you get everything prepared ahead of time.	9
there was one guy that we tested for preemployment for drugs who absolutely swore up and down that it showed that he was using amphetamines,	24
{C and } you make it into new  paper,	25
Yeah.	15
{C or } I did, have a favorite channel that I usually tuned into for local news.	24
{F Huh, } that, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } uh-huh.	15
It really is high.	9
{C and } [ I, +  when I'd gotten back I ] had gotten some sun  that day,	24
{F Oh, } they help you.	9
{C and } [ we've had it for ov-, +  he's been there for ] a long time --	24
there's  this DOCTOR SEUSS sleep book.	24
-- I don't think mine know either.	24
Okay,	38
{C and then } once you pick that spot out, pick out what you want to do.	18
<Children _talking> there was a roof leak,	24
Right.	15
I hope to see employer based, {D you know, } helping out. {D You know, } child, {F uh, } care centers at the place of employment [ and, + and  ]  things like that, that will help out.	24
I imagine, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C and. } -	26
{C And, }  {F um, } one of the problems  with the Lotus data base was, {F um, } that it was uncontrolled access to who would have that information.	24
Uh-huh.	36
it's got a boat engine in it <laughter>.	9
Yeah.	15
# [ There is never, + there was no ] reason # -- -- the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence.	9
The one thing that keeps coming to mind to me is that [ they're, + <child> they ] don't have enough space in the prisons to put people	24
Right.	15
<Laughter>.	20
{C And, }  {F uh, } [ they're, + they're ]  actually going to extend it, I think, one of these days maybe to apartment complexes	24
Right.	15
{C and } I try to look at it.	24
{C And so } that's why I went ahead and got one.	24
They feel uncomfortable, I think.	9
{D well, } I didn't tell you what year <<spoken as if talking to other person>>.	25
I have friends that pay about nine hundred dollars for a town house -- -- in, -	24
{F Oh, } man,	21
[ that, +  that ] forces a lot of the guys to get out of the game.	9
My mom likes {D like, } {F uh, } Doris Day, {D you know. }	24
{C but } I don't think it's fair.	9
Probably find someone, -	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
She'll be in kindergarten next year.	24
{C So } that's helping.	9
Right.	15
[ I, + {F uh, } <breathing> -- -- I ] don't really like hot weather	24
Good.	6
Yeah.	15
{C or, } {D Well, } that's good.	26
{F Um. }	15
it's like there, -	24
yes.	36
{D well, } yeah.	36
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } when did it happen?	14
Uh-huh,	15
{C and } there's garbage when I left.	24
we've been cooking a lot of, turkey breasts. Because it's low fat.	24
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] don't let them come back,	9
Uh-huh.	15
I think -- -- this is scandalous the way everybody's picking on him.	9
Yeah,	15
Yeah,	4
{C but } it ended up  protecting big investors. Which I don't think what it was meant to do,	9
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } okay.	29
Uh-huh.	15
Sometimes it's, -	34
<Children_yelling>.	20
you just look at the checking account, and say this is what we have for money	9
Yeah  --	36
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and, } ] {F uh, } there has to be resentment built up,	9
{D Well, } we don't want one any place <laughter>,	24
Right	15
Uh-huh	15
{C So } there were things around there.	24
{C but } that car just purrs like the day it was built.	24
{C but, }  {F uh, } we've got a budget deficit that just won't go away unless it gets seriously addressed.	9
{C and, }  {F uh, } the first three days, -	26
[ [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C and, } ] + {C and, } ] they are so easy to do if you, {F uh, } have a good barbecue sauce --	9
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	36
{D well, } I call my lawn man,  Eric, whatever his name is,  {A I can't remember. } Who's going to come and build me a fence, too.	24
{F Uh, } {D you know, } it's nice to have a little bit set aside [ for the, + for the ] unexpected shall we say. So that it doesn't, {F uh, } kill you all in one month.	9
{C and } I think that's good because it does allow people to be individual	9
{C And } {D you know } {D like } he sent  planes over [ to, +  to ] shoot the people down [ that were on the border with, +  {F uh, } [ tha-, +  that ]  were on their way to ] Turkey.	24
# Okay. #	29
{C And } there were a bunch of kids, {D you know, }   {C and } a bunch of schools.	24
you can wash up easily because they're water soluble.	9
[ It's got a, + it's going to have ] little wooden hearts holding it, in its hands -- -- and then welcome written on those little wooden hearts.	24
{D Well, } how do you feel about trial by jury?	31
{F Oh, } yeah?	12
They went to work	24
I think he was just probably a passing phenomena, I think <laughter>.	9
You # -- -- release it right <noise> at the top,	24
{F Um. }	26
Uh-huh	15
{C But, }  {F uh, } <swallowing> I never had bad experience in that respect <sniffing>.	24
[ [ I, + I, ] + I ] really agree that, [ that + that's ] pretty important.	24
nice talking with you.	38
yeah.	15
{F Huh? }	14
# {F Uh, } originally # from New Jersey.	24
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } okay.	29
Uh-huh.	15
-- {C and, so, } {D you know, } I guess it's all relative,	9
I'm not going to spend the time [ giving, + leaving  ] a message,	24
{F Oh, } that's okay.	27
[ here they have different, + {F uh, } besides just different levels within the same program, they have different ] types of programs.	24
{C So, } {F uh, } what else do they do in the Dallas area?	31
<Noise>.	20
Really bad.	21
Not that I don't like reporting,	24
{C and } he's going on to Williams.	24
I just. -	26
That's great.    *[[slash error]] Utilitarian.	21
Uh-huh.	15
I knew you were going to say that.	24
{C And } he, I don't know, just, -	19
Yeah.	15
{C But } still the, -	26
[ [ we were, + we had, ] + we were ] staying at the other end of the island,	24
{F Uh, } Okay,	15
Washington --	24
Actually, I don't think we are.	5
[ That, + that ] starts tomorrow night.	11
{D Well, } I'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring.	24
the one I talked about the other night was good,	24
[ that, + that's ] a tough situation.	21
{C But, }  at least, it isn't, {D you know, } burning a hole in his pocket.	24
it was on T V recently, <baby_crying> {F uh, } FATAL ATTRACTION.	24
it puts those little wrinkles around your lips.	24
{F Oh, } gosh.	21
I just can't believe it.	17
right.	36
<Throat_clearing>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
Pop-up.	15
{C but, } {F um, } for the most part [ i-, +  [ they, +  they ] ]  always had, {D you know, } -	24
They have every kind of fish that you could imagine you'd want --	24
<lipsmack> {C But, } on the other hand, it is [ very, + very ] expensive to maintain,	9
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah.	15
I'll do something with the piano,	24
the mail order ones that I've dealt with for roses and  that, they offer [ through, + through ] the first Summer. Which at least [ if they, + if they ] take off the first year, they're probably going to come up unless there's, {F uh, } a terrible freeze or something.	24
{C and } you would just pay a flat tax.   No exemptions, no deductions or  anything else [ after + {D you know, } after ] you figure up who's in your family.	24
it isn't.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } I used to do that though <laughter> because I was the youngest,	24
Oh.	15
{D Well, } {F uh, } [ do you, + {F uh, } do you ]  ever use the A T M machines?	7
[ {C and } +  {C or } ] they were all in the same [ ar-, + geographical ] location.	24
me too.	24
right.	15
we kept charts of our progress, and, {F uh, } consistently increased the empty of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks.	24
Yes,	36
<Laughter> That's like, -	26
it's supposed to be eighty-five today,	24
I think it's two seventy-five for a family	24
she's never traveled anywhere,	24
{C So, } {E I mean } people are still wearing shorts	24
I, -	26
Yeah,	4
I totally agree.	36
{C And } she wouldn't, -	24
-- {C and } that was one thing about the year around school that originally we had been sort of negative on it.	24
Yeah.	4
Okay,	38
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } you're not, {D you know. }	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I called	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } it's, {D you know, } the coach's fault,	9
-- you tend to think, well, there's one fuse operating the whole thing,	24
{C And } Sam Perkins, here, he's one guy I did follow	24
what is that restaurant off of Central?	39
Oh	15
{F Uh, } I never really thought of, it that way.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I can't find one that I've done.	24
<Laughter> That was a good  ((   )) . -	21
Yeah <laughter>.	4
I th-, -	26
that's good, that sounds like they've got a lot going on there.	9
# Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	4
Yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } that I've been aware of, I've, -	24
{E [ I, + I ] mean, } I think, {F uh, } some sta-, -	26
[ [ [ I don't, + I don't, ] + I didn't know what, ] + I don't even know what ] our controls are.	24
But, uh, -	26
Yeah,	15
{D You know, } [ the, + the ]  freeze just got them.	24
{D Well, } you can, -	24
I find it changing the way that I eat, but not the way I entertain,	24
{C and, } {F uh, } the next thing you know we'll be turning around  just like we did to Poland	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C so, } when I bake it's usually to take out for something.	24
{D Well, } it has been that way for a very,   very long time, though.	9
That's something we want to learn.	24
I'm not, -	26
I find it hard to, {F uh, }  follow from one page to another.	24
If you have to put a price on it.  Which is more valuable, life or  paying a little more.	16
{C and } he acted about the same <laughter>.	24
are you a student	7
Yeah <laughter> <<pause>>.	15
{C so } -- -- I reluctantly gave that career up and am just substituting at the school,	24
{C and } none of my, -	26
I don't take much more in myself.	24
[ It, + it's ] that there really isn't a whole lot.	9
Yeah.	15
{C and } they let her bring [ her, + her ] little daughter in for free.	24
<laughter> yeah	36
Yes.	15
yeah.	15
It makes a lot of difference.	24
{C or, } -	26
Something, # {D you know, } # -	26
I think that we're [ really, + really ] putting a lot of stress on ourselves.	9
{C And } I was real disappointed with it.	24
Right,	15
Uh-huh.	4
[  I've, + {F uh } -- -- I've ] found also a lot of companies nowadays,  [ have, + they have ] eight hundred numbers you can call.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } I've noticed, that now, more and more individual people are speaking out for their own rights rather than massing together.	9
{E I mean, } why, -	26
Yeah.	15
Every six months I have to pay car insurance.	24
-- {C and } he had it for about three or four years where we just about had to lift him and carry him every place he went.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } they both cooperate together on, -	24
Eerie feeling,	22
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
[ {C and, } + {C and } ]  I've been looking at these, {F uh, } {F uh, } {D like } in Home Depot where you can go and they've got,  [ that + ] ironing boards that will just flip right down off of [ [ [ the + {F uh, } {F uh, }  [ what,  + ] the, ] + the, ] + the ] door.	24
That's good isn't it <talking>.	7
-- {C but, } {F uh, } I have friends [ that, + that  ] have kids just starting kindergarten	24
-- {C so } I don't know if she's going to even use it anymore.	24
# Right. #	36
Here, hang on just a second,	18
I would, -	26
{D Well } I grew up in Los Angeles.	24
I certainly wouldn't have been able to  twenty years ago tell you what, {F uh, } my kids were likely to be like.	24
which has a lot of pollution from their plants,	24
How funny.	21
Is that what you think?	7
#  (( Yeah )) . #	15
{D well, } good.	21
No,	15
{C But } I find it, -	26
I don't see someone not going out there and committing murder because they're afraid they're going to get sentenced to death.	9
Yes.	4
Yeah,	36
His family was very scattered and very diverse.	24
no.	36
{C and } it seems like I always, I never go to the fiction section,	24
{C but } there's, so many of us kids, {A there was {D like } seven of us } that, <breathing> [ my, + we ] wouldn't have probably allowed that to happen anyhow.	24
{C And } I wanted to go to college,	24
I get, -	26
Yeah.	15
isn't that a fact?	23
{C And } I think it was tremendously down.	24
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
I wouldn't even know, {D you know, } to go look for that author or that book.	24
{C and then } [ you, + you ] bake that	24
they'd have that respect for # what it does, # and what it can do.	9
{C so } <inhaling>, # I # am hoping [ that, + that ] soon [ they will, + they will, ]	24
huh-uh.	33
[ {C But, } + {C but } ] they couldn't leave him alone at all.	24
Yeah,	4
<Laughter>.	20
# Yeah.	36
{C so, } hopefully, this ownership can set up new direction and, {F uh, } keep, {F uh, } the Patriots in the New England area anyways <talking>.	24
Yeah.	15
they fill up the whole kitchen <laughter>  garbage can --	24
yeah.	15
{C or } you get counseling earlier	24
Right,	36
Uh-huh.	15
[ Which, + what ] book have you read that is along those lines, # that # was really good?	39
[ I did-, + I didn't ] give them away,	24
[ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {C but, } ]  (( {F uh } )) , we'll need an unanimous verdict	9
{C either } computer paper {C or } different types of paper.	24
{C and, } [ it's, + it's ] really neat.	9
{C and } the landlord cut it down  {C and } said, Yeah, that's one thing you have to do is keep that lilac bush cut down so  it doesn't rub up against the siding --	24
{C and, } -	26
{F Um, } yeah,	4
{C but } I do here.	24
{C But, }  {F um, } I used to do more [ [ before, +  {F um, } before I had, ] +  before we got ] our baby,	24
Oh <laughter>.	15
I've never heard of it.	24
[ {C And, }  + {C but } ] she doesn't china paint	24
Uh-huh.	15
Okay	15
<Laughter>.	20
{C and } they brought it down to the shelters.	24
a lot of things do that.	9
# Until they were two.	24
Uh-huh.	15
that was good,	9
{C And } it looks nice.	24
{C but, }  <laughter> # I don't <laughter>. #	24
I mix it until it just tastes good # to me. #	24
Uh-huh.	4
They give you scholarship, a hundred percent, [ if you're, + if you work ] for T C U.	24
Yeah.	13
I think it's generally that switch over.	9
I think it's up to individuals too, to ask automakers [ for, + for ] less pollutant vehicles.	9
Right <laughter>.	15
{D Now } my personal opinion, -	24
{C so } it has to stay inside	24
{C so } it's full of smoke [ when, + when ] you go in there.	24
{F Oh, } okay.	29
No,	33
Yeah.	15
I can't talk I had chocolate bavarian tort, for desert, # today, # which I never eat at   lunch	24
uh-huh.	15
I sure did.	24
and {C how } to save water [ b-, +   when you brush ] your teeth in water	24
there's two parts of Texas, East Texas and North Texas.	24
I listen to a little of that	24
Right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C And then } [ I, + {D you know, } I ] did that for six years.	24
That's an interesting theory.	9
-- {C but, }  {F uh, } {D well, } Lynn,  I've enjoyed talking with you.	38
# It may be a blessing in disguise. #	9
it's called the slender blender,	24
{C and } I've got, <laughter> {D you know, } -	24
yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
You can't drive a car without bumper sticker	24
I would, definitely.	36
{C and } it went right up over my head	24
{C But } [ it's still, +  it's ] real different not to have another adult with you.	9
[ I've, + I've ]  sort of always felt like with Buicks it seems like all Buicks to me look alike <laughter>, {D you know, }	24
that is neat <laughter>.	21
all now [ [ we're, +  we're, ] +   {D you know, } we, ] -	26
# Oh.  #	15
{C and } nobody has interrupted.	24
yeah.	36
I think when they refer to different kinds of fishing -	24
{C and, } {F um, } we like that British comedy.	24
{C so, } [ it's not too, + it's not too ] often that you see him swaying too many opinions.	9
{D Well, } [ the, + the ]  Honda's [ have been, + have been ] very safe. [  In, + in ] accidents, {F uh, } more so that a lot of the American cars.	24
<Inhaling> {F Oh, } probably not.	32
Each of our, -	26
you  ever heard of Lufkin?	7
{C And } I took it to Town North,	24
{C but }  I sometimes have problems starting the mower,	24
mostly.	11
{F Oh, } I see.	29
[ I like to, + I like to ] do it	24
Yeah.	26
I have one at, {F uh, } -	24
That's interesting.	9
{C so, } -	26
{F Oh, } really.	15
The baby was eleven weeks old	24
{C so } you don't have to watch the commercials.	24
I don't care about seeing the best players in the world play.	24
{C because } they want to be a service to us	39
{C but } of course, if you're educated and you don't speak English, no one thinks anything of you.	24
{C And } it's a lot cheaper <laughter>.	24
My wife and I really,  I guess are fortunate.	24
uh-huh.	15
they're eating pecans though <noise>.	24
that's sort of upsetting, to think that we're richer and yet everybody is intellectually poorer <laughter>.	24
-- there's no type of, {F uh, } savings of any sort that the company will reimburse you for.	24
Yes,	15
I'm ma-, -	26
{C So } she made him go sleep upstairs.	24
{F Uh, } [ what, + {F uh, } what  ] activities do you do when you're camping?	39
{C And } he said this way if it were to make the drug test positive, you have proof that your doctor ordered this for you, {D you know. }	24
The guy was standing there	24
{D Well, } {E I mean, } unfortunate-,  I think people like you are relatively rare who are coming up against this problem every day.	9
I don't, -	26
# Right. #	15
{F Uh, } I guess that's the whole U S concept -- -- is to come here and, -	9
{E I mean, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] would expect their own problems would keep them away from us for a while,	9
Uh-huh.	15
[ it was a, + it was a ] housing division.	24
{C and, } {F uh, } of course, nothing ever goes down,	9
Yeah.	36
we should cause it does help.	24
I work in the airline, [ ma-, + marketing ] group.	24
<laughter>.  That's how it's going now.	24
I promise.	13
I'd eat too.	24
Yeah.	15
{C but } I have always loved reading.	24
<Laughter> Oh.	15
Yeah.	15
-- {C but } I was real lucky because it just hit [ the, + {F um } -- -- the ] lens to the light.	24
[ {C and } -- + -- {C and } ] it's -- -- least hard on your body,	24
{D Anyhow } <laughter>, -	26
Yeah.	30
Do you work outside the home?	7
No,	36
The only thing you've got to watch is when that creek comes up.	24
Although, they do the same thing <laughter>.	24
{C so, } {F uh, } I keep, -	26
<Phone_ringing>.	20
{C and } you wouldn't have to mix that much together even.	24
{F Oh, } gosh,	21
these were, {F uh, } trees [ that, + that ] wintered.	24
{D Well, } I don't necessarily either.	24
Hence the savings and loan problem we have.	9
{D you see, } I guess it depends on your landfill space.	24
Yeah.	15
And if you are a little bit claustrophobic	9
I root for Nebraska quite a bit.	24
I'm sure it would have to affect you the same way.	9
{C and } that's pretty fun.	21
{D Well } that's pretty good if you can do that.	9
((   )) .	20
Yeah,	4
Uh-huh.	15
[ I, +  I ] know of some people  who did, {F uh, }	24
Uh-huh.	15
that person voluntarily gives up when they decide to commit that crime,	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C But, } {D you know, } same, {F uh, } -	26
Yes.	4
If you don't like to exercise, {D you know, } it isn't going to happen.	9
{D Well, } hopefully the bins will be here in this  month	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
[  wait, + wait ] run that back,	25
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I knew that they had presented an extremely  slanted viewpoint, that was, in my estimate,  nowhere near truth but was much better for ratings.	24
{C And so } they went and tried out	24
Right.	15
I've been up there.	24
{C But } [ he, + he ] kind of said something to me about probably  not as bad as your foot,	24
That's true.	36
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
What was I thinking.	24
{C but } they like them around because they do all the menial labor and such.	24
{D Well, } we have on SESAME STREET  and  MISTER ROGERS, that kind of stuff,	34
From [ [ a frie-, + {F uh, } from my, ] + my son's friend ]  down the street.	24
it just was not effective enough to ... -	9
Yeah.	4
I'll just go with you first.	24
I think <breathing> that's the hardest thing,	9
It's an interesting <laughter> (( problem. ))	9
they're mean	24
My mom doesn't even like for us to go through her cabinets.	24
{C So } mine I don't spend a whole lot of time because they're not here.	24
{C but } he was,  {E no, } completely against having a dog or cat,	24
{C but } the other ones are very special getaways,	24
They take out in state and federal taxes -- -	24
Right.	15
Yeah,	36
it was just, -	26
our car payment  is equivalent to both of our student loans.	24
# Yeah,	36
<Breathing>.	20
{C and } it sounds like it's not fluff.	9
{C And, } {F um, }  with the American Express they say there is no limit.	24
It was the charge card and social security number.	24
What do you usually wear to, -	39
We saw that too,	24
{C and then } he goes home	9
{C and } [ they, +  {F um, } if they're ] not going  to use them they'll give them to somebody else.	24
She had to label everything.	8
{C and } you get to meet different people, and, {F um, } just get out, {D you know, } out and about,	9
it was  in [ [ our, + in our ] little local paper, +  our little Lewisville paper ]  that comes out twice a week on the front page every week, {F uh, }	24
The law enforcement community, {F uh, } {F uh, } {D you know, } [ has to, + has to ] separate the difference between somebody who is being set up in which, {F uh, } grievous <<mispronounced>> acts are done [ [ [ to, + {F uh, } ] + to, ] + {D you know, } to ] get somebody into [ a, + a ] situation where they're going to be guilty [ of, + of ] a crime.	9
Yeah,	36
# [ [ it's, + it's # -- ] + it's ] refreshing to hear somebody, that has a similar opinion as mine.	9
{C or, } I want to see it though.	24
Yeah.	15
that's right,	36
That makes a big difference.	9
{C But, }  {F uh, } -	26
I know that's what I want,	24
{F Uh, } mandatory service.  {D Yeah. }  I don't think it's a good idea, {F uh, }	9
<Laughter> So do I.	24
{C So. }   It was a call to the local appliance dealer -- -- who came out and fixed them all,	24
No,	36
Ye-, -	26
The usual, I think.	24
Uh-huh.	15
<Throat_clearing> Yeah,	15
That's what I like to see.	9
# {F Oh, } okay # .	15
Don't they?	23
{C but } I think the city one could possibly look into that or something.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{D well, } that's good, because I didn't like Oklahoma that well <laughter>.	24
it, -	26
{C and } the other  one's two and a half,	24
{C and } [ I've had, + now I have ] twenty-three thousand miles on it.	24
that's too soon.	24
Bye.	38
talk to faculty members and students.	9
[ that's, + that's ] # true, all too many times.	9
{C and } -- -	26
[ Flowers, +  during the summer down here,  [ the, +    the  ] normal kind of flowers, ] there's very few of them that will really do well.	24
wow.	21
{E I mean, }  I'm just now finally to a point where, -	24
I wanted to see it, {F uh, } because there  was, {F uh, } much recommended, for months and months and months	24
I've never, -	26
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
I {E mean, } I'm not real old	9
{C And } I got one of those Jane Fonda workout tapes that I dubbed from a friend.	24
{C And } I listen cause on Friday nights [ they have the, + {F uh, } they have what ]  they call Saturday Night Alive	24
# I, # -	26
# Yeah. #	15
{C But } golf was one that I developed a working knowledge of a lot of the golfers,	24
{C So, } I kind of have [ a, + an ] amount in my mind	24
{C And } every time you go to buy anything now,  {F uh, } -	9
{C And, } {F um, } of course, now, -	26
{F Oh, } I know	38
{F Oh } really?   <<Voices fade>>.	12
{F Um, } do you have a lot of large  families out there in Texas,	7
he had a blue one before	24
# All right.	36
{C And, } {F uh, } then you put it on a flour, {D like, } {D you know, } -	24
{F Oh, } {D well, } [ that's, +  that's ] a, -	26
{D So } [ I, + I ] figure, {D you know, } [ nobody must, + {F uh, } nobody must ] like it.	9
[ {C Or, } +  {F uh, } {C or } ]  there should be some way where it could be opted for them not to have a jury.	9
In terms of you got to put everything in its own little bag and really  presort it really, {D you know, } tightly.	24
Yeah,  {D well. }	36
{F Uh, } after all, [ who, + who ] writes.	16
What, {F uh, } go ahead and tell me about your home <laughter>.	18
{D Well, } that's interesting.	21
{D [ Y-, + you ] know, } some health related thing is going to blow me away.	24
Yeah.	15
{F Huh. }	26
{C and } it's not my children.	9
Yeah.	15
I think was the last time I was [ up, + up ] there  and at Center Park.	24
Your covering basic care there and not all the extras that most people would like to see done with there children, {D you know, } like the educational  activities, the supervised play and so forth.	9
<Sneezing>.	20
{C and } really, we was,  {D you know, } -	26
especially the murder rate,  its just gone crazy.	24
my parents have a treadmill	24
{C so } I had to call and have them all repaired and that.	24
Uh-huh,	36
{C but } it's stays pretty cold even, {F uh, } during the Winter, for as nice as it is.	24
"{C so } we got all fearful for our people, come to find out they came back and said they weren't even aware of it,   *[[ Shouldn't a slash follow ""our people"", making this 2 separate utterances? ]]"	24
Uh-huh,	15
# <Laughter> That's the # kind you like you mean?	7
[ {C and, } + {C and }  ] {F uh. } -	26
Right,	15
{F Oh, } yeah.	36
{C But, }  it's a good company.	9
Yeah.	15
I would like to see the results on a study done.	24
# <Laughter>. #	20
Uh-huh.	15
I remember watching the World Series during the earthquake, and just seeing that happen --	24
-- {C and } he owns a lot of acreage that's been farmed properly, {D you know } --	24
Yeah.	15
That's good.	21
I think it's somewhere around <child_talking> twenty five cents a gallon.	24
# Yeah. #	15
Uh-huh.	15
I remember when they first opened up.	24
{C But, } [ {E I mean } the, + {E I mean } there's ] nothing to do,	24
Uh-huh,	36
we have plans this year to drive up to the, {F uh, } to Colorado.	24
it really is.	36
No.	33
Yeah.	15
{C and } they just had their brand new little trees.	24
When they start getting rid of technicians, -	9
Yeah.	15
# {E I mean } that's the only, # thing that I can figure out because I've heard so many  people say {D well } I'm not going on voting on that one, {D you know, } [ I, + I'm ]  going to go fishing today.  Or it won't make any difference [ if, +  if ]  I don't vote <thumping>	24
{F Oh, } my.	21
industry here is able [ to, + to ] fund the state because we have oil here and things,	8
Right.	36
<Noise> Uh-huh.	15
{C But, } {D you know, } critically acclaimed.	9
{D Well, } I'll tell you why I feel so, -	24
{C and } the alternate time would be recyclables,	24
[ you, + you  ] do have to figure it out. [ And, + and, ] {D you know, } [ to + ] get proteins and things.	9
# No.  #	32
[ I, + I ] definitely think that has gotten a lot worse,	9
{C and, } {F um, }  ((   ))  I'm trying to think.	17
So outrageous.	2
that was always kind of interesting,	9
that cuts into our free time right there.	9
{F Huh. }	26
{F Oh, } my goodness.	17
# {F Oh, } my. #	21
<Laughter>.	20
That's, -	26
{C so, } -	26
I get to share whatever I did with my wife, [ and, + and ] vice versa.	24
I have had a recipe that someone has given me that it's kind  of like you just mix cream cheese and stuff -- -- and refrigerate it, {D you know --  }	24
{C And } that's, {F uh, } course hydrogen sulfide, which is when you burn gasoline, you also produce some water vapor -- -- and that goes back in with your sulphur	24
have you ever had to plan a family reunion?	7
[ [ [ I, + # I think, ] + I think the, ] +  {F uh } -- -- I think that ] the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the, {F uh, } elderly -- -- {F uh, } person who's <noise> going in and the family that's going to be, {F uh, } [ effec-, + effected ] by it --	9
I kind of, -	26
{C And, } {C because } it's [ full, + full ] scholarship.	24
{C and then, } {F uh, } I've kind of gotten hooked on P B S  stuff, {F uh, } public, {F uh, } T V.	24
{F uh, } <smack> I would personally like it	24
{F Uh, } sometimes when I hear [ [ what, + what ] they're, +    [ even what, + even what ]  the politicians are ] making, {D you know, }  when they're getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that, {F uh, } I think that's just a bit too much to be paying them, {F uh, }	9
we have tried, -	9
[ I, +  I'm ] not sure there's a positive solution for that.	9
{D Now } are you married, that you both, you and your wife use a credit card,	7
<Laughter>.	20
{F Um. }	26
Yeah,	15
[ I think, + I think, ] that's a lot of people,	9
{D Now } whether they finally got it or not, I don't know.	24
{C but } you can always  blame it on having children,	24
[ [ I, + I don't want to, ] + I want to ] chew up the whole line {D here. }	24
{C And } [ it was really a nice, + it was really a nice ] compromise, especially, because she felt like she was still living in her own house.	24
{F Uh, } [ those of kind of, + {D yeah, }  those  ] are joining arguments,	9
It's, {F uh, } unfortunately probably [ what, + maybe ] twenty-five or thirty percent of them do that.	9
he claimed, [ he had, + he didn't have ] to pay income tax	24
Uh-huh.	36
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	15
Oh.	15
uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } [ that was, + that was ] an excellent movie.	9
Th-, -	26
yeah.	15
{D Well, } I don't know.	34
she found an ad for one in {D like } a GOOD [ HOU-, + HOUSEKEEPING  ] magazine for eleven percent.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
{F Oh, } yeah,	36
It, -	26
If I don't want any interruptions, # {D you know. } #	24
Yeah,	15
I know there's still a long way to go especially in top management <static>.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } I like all the nature things there are to look at, {D you know. }	24
<Noise>.	20
{C so, } [ it's, + it's ] amazing too, {D you know, } [ with that, + with the ] oil wells burning over there, that's the exact same stuff that's coming out of cars every day, [ just in, + {F uh, } just in ] a little different # grade, I guess. #	9
Things to hang on the wall.	24
Ex-, -	26
<Laughter>.	20
six minutes and  a half.	24
otherwise, -	26
{D now } that's got that big V eight engine in it, [ doesn't it, + doesn't it? ]	7
it's just getting the time to do it <laughter>.	9
That's the kind of training I've had.	24
He doesn't really like mine, let alone another one.	24
Uh-huh.	15
and, uh, you know, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
Have you found -- -- trouble finding movies for them	7
I know.	21
{C and } it's landing somewhere with the wind,	9
# Yeah.  #	15
{C So. } I know I was in, {F uh, } Houston when I was working for a  company once,	24
{D so, } I hadn't seen that in a long time.	24
[ that's, + that's ] true.	36
Right.	15
{C but, } -	26
{C and } all seven are in a sport,	24
{C so } it's real hard to, -	9
Yeah,	36
Wow.	21
[ I, + I ] don't think we should be spending time saying somebody's wearing torn clothing or  wearing [ sh-, + [ too + ] shorts, ] too short	9
{D You know, } it's like  everyone's a, # manager	24
that's good.	21
That's funny.	21
it starts everywhere -- -- until [ we can't, + we've ] just lost control [ of, + of ] any kind of perspective about what is acceptable and what is not acceptable, {D you know. }	9
# Uh-huh,	15
{C so } -- -- we needed to start doing more of that just for, {F uh, } {D you know, } saving for college and things like that.	24
[ it's just, + it's just ] home cooking.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } I'm not sure I could afford three.	9
[ What, + what ] is that?	39
Who's going to run it, {D you know, }	16
# Now, # -	26
{C But, } when, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
[ I, + I ] think that any company or anything that wants to contribute to a fund -- -- should be able to do that, and be registered with what they ever contribute.	9
{C so, } -	26
{C and } it's worth doing it.	9
{F Oh, } that would be a mess.	21
# {C but } <laughter>  # he is smart <<very faint>>, {D you know. }	24
[ Imagine, + imagine # -- ] -- what it is for us to make mark off models, {D you know. }	24
that's just it.	36
to answer that one before we get to our subject, {D you know, } I always get a kick out of Republicans who take credit for all the military hardware that was bought for the war and how successful it was, though when it comes to the budget they say well the Democrats control all the money	24
Yeah.	36
{C and } he just absolutely swore by it.	24
{C So } anyway,	26
{C and } I'll say, I'm a homemaker since that's my basic thing, {F uh, }	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	36
Is it, {D you know } -- -	26
{C and } I anticipate the same thing with  the Honda whenever I decide to sell it,	24
What do you think about it?	31
# {C And } you worry when, # {D you know } [ these + the ] sex and drugs on the young children and the unborn children, -	9
our topic today?	39
{F Um. }	26
What about yourself?	31
Oh.	29
{C and } my daughter's been going with the same boy for a while,	24
{C So } we found the Audi second hand.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
right,	15
{C And } I think I learned a lot of that in school too.	24
-- {C so. }   {F Uh, } I was wondering too, if they were thinking [ of + about ] the judge making awards in civil cases -- -- not just sentencing [ in, + in ] a criminal cases.	24
Bye.	38
some stay for longer.	24
{C And } it'll drop their earnings by a hundred million a year forever more.	24
{C and } the whole family eats.	24
{C but } the majority ((of it)) is to the availability of the individual to pay <sigh> <clicking>.	24
{C and then } [ they recy-, + they separate ] it.	8
That's somebody you can get behind and, be patient.	9
Right.	15
Yeah,	36
# Al # Davis [ is, + he's ] a kind of strange character, [ strange, + strange ] looking guy.	9
Considering the Kennedys made all their money off bootleg whiskey anyway.	9
that's the, {F uh, } latest thing.	9
Yeah,	15
Right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
When you sat in the seats, they adjusted to fit around you.	24
Uh-huh.	15
#  ((   )) . #	20
{C and } they have the later ten game winning streak --	24
My wife and daughter, -	24
When, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C So } we decided to forget that.	24
[ The, + the ] cats, -	26
{C but, } {F um, } I like watching it on T V.	24
Exactly,	36
{D like } the juries that I've served on, are businessmen.	24
{C and then } we're going to go and vote, {D you know. }	25
{F Oh, } [ I, + I ] really enjoyed that.	24
Uh-huh.	15
I've seen that.	24
{C and } the new cars [ it's hardly + is, hardly ] anything.	9
{C and } <children_talking> I, -	26
[ I, + {E I mean, } it ] doesn't even pay for me to earn a good wage, because, -	9
Mike you take care now.	38
{C so, } {D you know. } -	26
the bottom fell out.	24
{C and } you say, no thanks.	9
It's not -- -- nearly as important.	9
kind of hard to find one prebuilt that [ 's +  kind of fits ] those specifications.	9
Um, yeah.	15
one of the things that  sort of bothers me is the ability, -	9
{C and } it is so overacted that you're just hysterical -- -- {D you know. }	9
{C Because } there are other [ [ I, + j-, ] + {F uh, } job ] opportunities, in Europe that there aren't here -- -- {D you know, } even, {F um, }	24
{C but } it cost me all kind of money, {D you know, } to have that repaired after they said they were going to,  they had repaired it.	24
that, -	26
If I come  [ in +  in ] a dress, everybody's shocked <laughter>.	24
Isn't that amazing?	12
{F um, } {C and } [ I don't, +  {D you know, }  we couldn't ] do that with a dog.	9
What part of the country?	39
{E I mean, } {F uh, } {F uh, } the only way that you're going to have peace over there, [ if, + if  ] we determine that we want to go in and wipe out every last one of them,	9
[ I li-, + I have ] a few, {D you know, }  favorite shows that I try not to miss.	24
{F Uh, } if I want to buy something, I'll take the initiative [ and, + and  ] go find it, {D you know. }	24
Yeah,	15
we going through the dust storms down here now,	24
{C But } I was a little bit older before I realized just how long it had been going on since -- -- L B J and -- -	24
{C and } [ he has, + he has ] some {D like } different programs out,	24
[ {C And, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } {D you know, } {F um, } did we make the right choices?	16
{C and } {D you know } they, -	26
# Just ten percent. #	9
she calls them just some basics about, um, you know, you don't take what's not yours,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } now that's surprising -- -- because normally [ they're just, + they're real ] good.	9
when you think of some of the best presidents we've had, in the past, have been people that have struggled to get to the top.	24
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah.	15
{C but } yet she's the type of person that, I don't know, if she'd be happy staying at home.	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] that's one thing als-, -	26
That's true.	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } somebody still has to collect all that -- -- and bundle it together	24
# {F Oh, } yeah.  #	21
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } he is now [ in, + in ] a program that's trying to get him out of high school because [ he, + he ] fell back several years ago	24
{C and, }  {F uh, } I'm not sure really how much I pay.	24
that substituted for a shower # <laughter> # --	24
{E I mean, } we have two kids, {D you know, } that just love him a lot,	24
Yeah.	15
I've just, -	26
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
Yeah,	15
[ [ I, + {F uh, } my, ] + my ] dad was always a [ pro-, + proponent ] of that.	24
{F Oh, } okay.	36
I like that.	24
{C And so, } {F um, } {D you know, } my children are getting older	24
We try to keep [ our, + {F uh, } <noise> our ] retirement and our savings kind of automated --	24
Who you're, -	26
I, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
Sure.	15
We were in, {F uh, } Austin yesterday.	24
I know there's  a [ lot of, + lot of ] problems with it,	24
[ {C and, } +  {C and }  ] [ that's, + I think that's  ] a really important lesson to learn.	9
{C So } they had to -- -- work all [ that, + that ] anger out,   [ and the, + and the ] nightmares that come along with it.	9
yeah.	15
It's the best car in the class for the [ be-, + cheapest ] amount of money.	24
{C and } it made a big, -	26
I don't,	24
{C but, } {F uh, } when it comes to telling kids that they have to do, {F uh, } two or three years of service into some kind of community, I don't know if that's appropriate for a government to suggest that and say, {D you know, } you have to do two years of community service before you can be a citizen	9
{F Oh, } that's true.	36
you're -- -- definitely right,	9
Uh-huh.	15
I know, {F um, } we're also going through adoption now,	24
# Uh-huh. #	4
{F Uh, }	26
# D-, # -	26
Just #once a week.#	24
yeah,	26
{C and } it was a really neat experience,	24
Wow,	21
Right.	15
I sure like [ the, +  {F uh, } [ convertible, + ]  those ] rag top LeBarons,	24
the humidity, especially for curly heads like me. -	24
It was like Thursday of that week	24
{D Well, } one of the cars I'm thinking about buying next is, {F uh, } a nice, safe, small car,	24
[ It, + it ] is always  incredible to me the number of times those kind of stupid  accidents happen to people.	24
Finance.	30
that's right.	36
(( Alfie )) did.	24
I still just [ don't + don't ] end up going cause it isn't at a convenient time or  I don't know something,	24
Yeah,	15
Not getting paroled, lets say in so many, years. -	9
{F Uh, } it seems to be not difficult enough for students. Not challenging enough. And just not generally competitive enough.	9
Is it?	12
no,	36
{D Well, } I'm a school teacher,	24
it's there.	9
{C And, } {F uh, }   *[[slash error]] No,	26
when they started putting all that pollution control stuff on the older engines is where they started getting into so much, {D you know, } trouble. Because the three fifty with all the, {D you know, } -	9
Right.	36
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
{C And, } I think, most people make better parents when they are  a little bit more mature.	9
{C and, }  {F uh, } they, -	26
That's a very neat idea,	9
{C and } he was supposed to go.	24
# {E I mean, } no,	32
in New York we had to pay  a state and a city, {F uh, } tax.	24
# {C and # so, } if, {F uh, } -	26
Yeah.	15
# Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Huh.	15
Yeah.	26
{F Uh, } I, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C But }  I, -	26
Of course, you can <laughter>.	25
{C and } I'm perfectly happy.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and, }  {F um, } we have the train,	24
Right <laughter>.	15
how do we get them <<pause>> to not get reelected over and over again.	16
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } in Japan they would be, {D you know. }	24
my husband  about once a weekend he'll go, {F uh, } to a couple of areas where he knows that the people just throw cans out.	24
You're kidding.	21
{C And } it's real, -	26
Uh-huh,	15
{C And } [ her, + her ] mother went over there just for that ...	24
Every now and then one is tempted to see [ what, + what. ]	9
{C and } you would go # visit. #	9
{C so, } {D you know, } [ that, + that  ] eliminates, {D like } three quarters of the magazine <laughter>. {D You know. }	24
{C  and } you've got to come up with a decision.	24
It's vacations, Christmas.	22
I'm up in Minneapolis now,	24
{C and, }  {F uh, } it's also very interesting in terms of how people choose the child care facilities <screeching>.	9
{F Oh, } ten months,	30
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } <breathing> I don't know why that is.	24
Yeah,	36
{C and, } {F uh, } [ they an-, + they are ] pretty down to earth about {F uh, } <lipsmack> what you can take [ and, + and ] what you can't take	9
Yeah,	4
{D You know, } {F uh, } I was on a jury	24
{C so } that is a good exercise for that.	36
{C But } they have, I think, [ one, + ]  just about the best prime rib -- -- {F um, } anywhere <laughter> -- -- in the area.	24
{C and then, } {F uh, } don't ask me what the other hair I made, -	18
# {F Oh, } boy. #	21
It's just a half hour,	8
{C And then } we # further # -- --  complicate it by saying, {D you know, } we will keep the polls open until eight o'clock.	9
[ he's, + he's ] very good.	24
they've changed their name so many times I've lost track,	24
any mass murderer type individual.	24
It's a [ whole, +  whole ]  different culture	9
Uh-huh.	4
Besides don't sweat the small stuff <laughter>.	24
{F Oh, } it's better to spend time with your kids, {A I think though, }  than glued in front of the T V anyway.	9
{F Oh, } I quite frequently  glance through headlines or, in the newspaper.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, }  I, -	26
<Laughter> No,	36
{C and } when you're saying older,  we're talking fifty up.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{F Um, }	26
Uh-huh.	15
"""This is tradition."	25
You do?	8
I do not get too into it.	24
you said yours are all, -	24
-- {C and } you throw it out	24
{C and } <laughter> you're trying to ration it, {D you know, }	9
I know,	36
I am sure.	24
I see.	21
Uh-huh.	15
You're going to have it just about anywhere.	9
You're just -- -- # getting # started.	9
Uh-huh.	15
do you like scary things?	7
# {E I mean } that's a losing  (( fight )) . #	9
I've been in here about eight years, too, I guess.	24
# (( )). #	20
{F Uh, } I, -	26
{F Oh, } my heaven.	21
Huh.	15
{C and } that is what he, -	26
-- I've gone blank.	24
{C and } keep up the good work.	38
I would put that too.	24
At U of U,	7
Someone did,	2
{C but }  ((   ))  your cousin could have a baseball team with twelve kids <laughter>.	24
{F Huh. }  {D Well } <laughter>, We sure do have a lot in common.	9
{F uh, } sometimes I wish I had them,	24
# {C But } {D anyway, } I enjoy it.	24
[ [ My, +  generally my, ] +  my ]  scalp will start,	24
# Yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
[ [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] +  {C but } ] we are going in a couple of weeks to the next one, in Scottsdale, Arizona, for that family.  <inhaling>	24
If United States is going to flex its muscle and be the super power that it is, not only does [ it, + it ] [ can + ] talk the talk, but it's got to be able to walk the walk.	9
{C So, } {F uh, } {F uh, } -	26
[ I've, +  actually I am ]  reading a couple of different books, <sigh> {F uh, }	24
{C so } we swam a lot	24
{C And, } {F um, } if you would drive by there, {D like } on your way to the beach or  something, there would just be  (( dumping ))  this huge amounts of smoke, into the air	24
# {C And } # -- -- once they have your number, they have your identification.	24
Cowboys are going to have a problem aren't they?	7
<Laughter> Yeah,	36
{D Well, } I was just looking around my house and thinking about the painting that I've done.	24
I   mean, like I said, [ that, + that's ] pretty varied.	24
<Sigh> I know.	36
Uh-huh.	15
{E I mean, } if [ [ you're, + you're, ] + you're ] knowledgeable on that. -	28
Oh.	15
{C and } he said that [ this woman + <talking>   this socialite ] in Plano had hired four guys  to kill her husband	24
That was one of the questions that she asked us to think about,	24
I know that judges aren't supposed to be crooked.	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	36
{C And then, } one is in [ Vermont, +  {F uh, }  [ [ [ Montpe-, + Mont-, ] + Montpelier ] +  -- -- Montpelier, ] Vermont ]	24
[ {C and } +  -- -- {C so } ] that was nice.	9
it was in the shop  about twelve times the first twelve months <laughter>.	24
{D well } it's five seventy here,	24
Yeah	15
Uh-huh.	15
That could very well be	9
{C But, } he thought ROBIN HOOD was great.	24
[ I don't think that, + some people I don't think ] have, {F uh, } a year in them to volunteer if you know what I mean.	9
Yes,	36
it [ just, + just ] doesn't make sense,	9
Go home and take, {F uh, } liquids and, {F uh, } rest.	2
Yeah.	15
is she kind of country?	7
I guess, everybody's  in Dallas that I talk to.	9
Oh.	15
Did you get a catalog or something from these people?	7
They don't really come out like they do in New Orleans, up here,	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } {D like } they're looking  {D like } for, {F uh, } G R E like  ninety-nine percentile and # this and that. #	24
it's very pretty inside,	24
Right now I'm  in Utah, of course.	24
{C but, } {F uh } -- -- that's pretty similar,	24
{C and } nobody ever showed us or  anything	24
We are being cooperative,	24
we're just using latex,	24
Uh-huh.	15
What else.	17
<Yawning> It almost costs so much to fix anything or  do anything with it,	9
Of course,	15
bye-bye.	38
It's nice coming,	24
Yeah,	15
{C And } [ that's, + that's ] the two things they associate with Dallas, Texas.	24
{C but, } -	26
I. -	26
That's great.	21
[ I've got a, + I got a ]  few pounds to lose myself.	24
I know that sounds awful because so many people think he's so wonderful	9
that you miss sitting home in your parlor, {D you know, } {F uh, } [ with, + with ] a six pack of beer and some, {F uh, } potato chips, # {D you know } # --	9
{D Well, } [ I saw, {F um, } + lately I've seen ] SOAP DISH.	24
Yeah.	15
believe me,	18
{C And } you take care.	38
This is hardly, almost June.	24
I don't know <laughter>.	19
{F Oh, } dear.	21
-- {C and, }  {F uh, } I learned to, -	24
It sounds like her life is full too.	9
{C And } [  we get some, + we get, ]  {F uh, } decent holidays.	24
{C But } [ it, + it ] sounds like you are, {F uh, } {D you know, } # interested # in what's going on around you.	9
{C But } I think it's good [ [ for, + {D you know, } for, ] + for  ] company, too,	24
{C and } I think I can be a better and  more effective employee # [ if, + if ] I  # -- -- had a little bit more information # along that line. #	24
{C So, } [ [ I have, + {F uh, } I have, ] + # {F uh, } I have ] children # -- -- Boy Scout age.	24
that sounds good.	9
{C and so } I sort of hinge halfway out in the real world	24
[ somebody, +  somebody ] abandoned her	24
{F Uh, } [ it's kind of, [ it + ] the stitch is kind of ]  like a knitting machine, {D like } [ the, + they're ] loopers under the bottom	24
{F Oh, } okay.	15
# <laughter>. #	20
[ what, + what ] major city is nearby?	39
You really think cars contribute a lot now that they've taken lead out of gas?	7
Is that a nice area?	7
{D well } I saw the commercial on T V,	24
Yeah,	15
-- {C and } everybody just shows up.	9
Yeah.	15
{C and } he took his mother's, -	24
[ That, + that's ] right, I think so.	36
<Laughter>.	20
-- {C and } I think that art of giving is  something that, {F um, } we don't have very much any more.	9
# Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } that's wonderful.	21
<Laughter>  It does,	36
Uh-huh.	15
I went to [ a, + a  ] car show down here [ about, + {F uh, } about ] two weeks ago,	24
as it turns out that one, that shop is near where I now work.	24
{C so. } -	26
{C and, } Yeah,	24
[ She, +  her ] lips were a little bit wide,	24
[ na-, + native ] Vietnamese people.	24
{C so } we had our Social Security numbers imprinted on our checks.	24
-- it looks just like orchids in different colors.	24
I don't know, {F uh, } if this would be helpful.	19
{C And } I'm not sure what happened,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } she just will, {E I mean, } she's going to eat the same way she ate, {D you know, } # her whole # life.	24
{C and } right now,  my list of books to be read have to do with, {F uh, } the art of selling.	24
{C and, } -	26
-- {C and } that scares me.	24
An they have to be in ideal physical shape, basically.	9
{F Oh, } I am telling you.	17
{D Well, } I'm with you.	21
# Uh-huh. #	15
[ the, + the ] catalogs are sales material.	9
[ Sh-, + {C but } she  ] was, -	26
I thought I heard this morning that in San Antonio it was in the nineties yesterday.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
{C because } I had lived in San Antonio for about twenty years,	24
Uh-huh,	36
{D So } do you have any plans of maybe running more when the weather gets nicer?	7
they have trailer parks that are  down around the corner from here	24
one is in college,  also swims in college,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } two days later he got out of jail <laughter>. For cocaine possession.	24
I said I'm not that steady,	24
I didn't care for the type of movie,	24
when you place a call -- -- topic is given to you.	24
I  enjoyed it.	24
{C so } I really can't complain about this one.	24
Uh-huh.	15
# right	36
You bet,	36
I think that's important  if [ [ [ you're going, + {D you know, } if you're going, ] +  {F uh, } kids are going to, ] +  {F uh, } parents are going ] to have to go -- -- you ought to make it at least [ semi-, + {D you know, } semi ] for them too.	9
do you have a V C R?	7
[ they, + they ] would have no problems doing it again.	9
{C But } [ it, + it ] really did,	24
I have twenty-five minutes for lunch.	24
{C and so } ... -	26
{C and } they may not tell you the reason why.   *[[slash error]] Uh-huh.	9
Uh-huh,	4
Right.	15
Good luck in everything.	38
Yeah.	15
Okay <tone>.	36
{C or } they used,	35
{F Huh. }	26
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
{C but } it's probably going to take me longer, because I didn't decide  to major in that until, <sniffing> {F uh, } about a year and a half after I was already in school,	24
except I couldn't want to have to park it in tight places all the time.	24
{C And } [ there is, + there is  ] a couple of burglars, {F uh, } breaking into the houses in the neighborhood.	24
Do you?	7
<Laughter>.	20
{C But } it really didn't cause  [ our, + our ] kids are still little.	24
They definitely do.	36
# Yeah. #	15
{F Um, } no,	33
# Yeah,	15
{C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } that didn't bother me, {F uh, } too much,	24
Yeah.	15
[ I, + I ] think Bush's kind of followed suit.	9
{D Well, } [ we have, + we have ] one that's recyclable [ and, + and ] then for {F uh, } lunch sacks and waste food	24
# {C And } at least if you legislated, # giving for a couple years of their  lives [ or, + or, ] {F uh, } [ a + ] (( honestly )) purely giving [ but, + but ] some sort of equitable  exchange, then at least the country would have gotten two years from them  where, {F um, } they would have given something to the country instead of [ take, + taking ]  away all their lives.	9
{C but, }  {F uh, } I really feel like -	26
{C And } I said I think the only way I would be in big favor of gun control is if they could absolutely guarantee that nobody would have them.	24
{C But, } {D you know, } {C and, } {D you know, } he's never going to be, to me, a functioning part of society.	9
<Laughter>.	20
I think that will probably do it,	38
sure.	15
{D You know? } -	7
this summer before we went on vacation,	24
# [ {C And } # -- + -- {C and, } ] [ for, + for, ] I'm sure, a lot of people going into a nursing home it's like saying my life is over	9
SESAME STREET comes on from {D like } nine to ten, which is a good time	9
{F Oh, } that sounds interesting.	13
I've enjoyed talking with you.	38
{D well, } {E I mean, }  [ I, + I ] wonder how people have sex, and things like that,	24
Yeah.	15
something else goes wrong always, {D you know, }	24
{C and } [ I -- + -- I ] knew, {D you know, } -	24
{C And } it's a brick house, with, {F uh, } some wood.	24
{C so, } [ I, + I ] think by now, it's a matter of, {F uh, } personal taste.	9
Peter Arnet was reporting direct from, {F uh, } Iraq.	24
{C so } they went bankrupt.	24
<Noise> <<sounds like she is slicing something>>.	20
[ Can they be, + Is it ] concealed,	7
Uh-huh.	15
either the radio or the T V -s got to be on <laughter>, the whole time.	24
{C and } we used to have [ those, + {F uh, } {D you know, } the  ] posted warning days.	24
Yeah.	15
# <Laughter>.  #	20
#  Do you miss living there?	7
Good luck.	38
I'm like, {D you know, } [ I, + I ] don't want to listen to this. <Laughter> Because {D you know, } you think of the original is {D like, } -	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C And } phone books are a large volume of annual <laughter> trash.	9
like I say, it's a broad category,	9
Uh-huh.	15
# {F Oh, } they were # taking kickbacks.	24
# Absolutely,	36
I think it'll escalate.	9
-- [ we, + {F uh, } <laughter> we ] would, {F um, } <laughter> clear out our basement,	24
I don't remember <baby> anything about Dukakis,	24
{F Um, } yeah,	4
{C And } interest is like eighteen or something.	8
{F Oh, } really?	12
No	36
{C and } you think everyone should have it.	24
Yes.	36
{C and } he said I can't believe that you're still getting such a kick out of that movie <laughter>.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but, }  {F uh, } -	26
{C And, } {F uh, } {F uh, } I've had thirteen hundred dollar bid   and [ I, + ]   as low as five hundred and forty dollars	24
<Laughter> {F Oh, } boy.	21
<sigh> # {C So, } [ there, # + There ] was one mother who, {F uh, } came by right,  even, before we started, [ who, + who ] obviously was, {F uh, } very interested in getting [ her, + her ]  daughter in [ or, + or ] having gotten her daughter in or something	24
# {D You # know } we have windows in our bathrooms which really makes it difficult for, -	24
Who's going to pay for mine?	39
{C And, } {F uh, } you also get, {D you know, } -	24
Uh-huh.	4
Oh.	15
Yes.	36
{D See, } I look at it this way.    If the company folds, I got to go find a job.	24
{D You know, } {D well, } {F uh, } {E I mean } [ it, + it's ] an interesting topic	9
[ that's, + {F uh, } this is  ] an interesting topic that they would bring up painting	9
{C But, }  {F uh, } [ It's, + {F uh, } <inhaling> it's ] definitely different.	9
# <Laughter>. #	20
Wendy, I guess we get to talk about   budgets tonight or lack of budgets [ if, +  {F uh, } if ] that may be the case -- -- and any kind of long term  financial planning or anything like that, {F uh, }	24
<Laughter> Yes,	15
Uh-huh.	15
that's if ... -	26
Course there's a few things that, {F uh, } I think I could do better if I was sitting up in the C E O's seat	9
I think it is totally wrong,	9
{C And } at the same time, I talked to another woman,	24
Right.	15
I guess I'll get back to my laundry <laughter>.	18
{C So } she does most of the shopping for our household	24
Uh-huh.	15
their best player this year, {D you know, } averaged twenty points a game --	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C So } [ that, + that's ] kind of in the way  I've done things is to get things that are new and then keep them forever.	24
[ I, +  {F uh, } I ] can almost live  [ on, +  on ] seafood and almost live on the crab meat if I <laughter> had to.	9
You're going to have twins have them on the bicentennial, {A is our motto. }  July fourth seventy-six <laughter>.	25
Yeah,	36
{C and } <sniffing> {C so } I can sit back and watch them.	24
[ I, + I ] was really crazy about Jags for a while	24
-- they were all {D like, } {F uh, } {D like } six eight and, {F uh, } {D you know, } six ten,	24
That's true.	36
I guess, {F uh, } I can start.	24
I guess pants and a shirt	24
# {F Oh } my goodness. #	21
it's funny.	9
# It's difficult these day, #	24
{E I mean, } {C and } it is ugly.	24
I don't mind the pool life at all -- -- during the day.	24
{C and } they have a game	24
{C And } it makes it real hard to have a yard [ or, + <static> {F uh, } or ] anything like that, [ a gar-, + their garden, ] their farms.	9
{D Well, } [ what, +  what ] do you  is think is [ the, + {F uh, } the ] main change in?	39
{C And } a lot of my sewing I kind of do out of necessity, {D you know, }	24
{C But } it, -	26
# Right. #	15
Uh-huh.	36
we would like the, {F uh, } industry to do more to take care of the waste products before they turn to incineration, because we feel that, {F uh, } the small percentage that they're going to be putting into the air is too much.	24
right.	15
Uh-huh,	15
Loneliness is the closest you can come, which is really quite different.	24
{E I mean, } I've heard stories now [ where the, + where [ the, + {F um, } the ] ] military is running around,	24
Yeah.	36
-- {C but } [ we just, + we  just ] never saw the results.	24
well, you know, a lot of people have well water,	9
it just never  started smelling,	24
{F Oh } really,	15
my children would give up eating before they gave up their cigarettes I think.	24
{C or } [ [ most of, + most of, ] + one of ] their spouses has already passed away.	24
Which, {F uh, } shows do you watch on T V?	39
Uh-huh.	15
I know you, -	26
{C and } I went through the T I fitness center and registered for the, {F uh, } aerobics classes there.	24
[ He, + {C but } he ] thinks he wants to be a writer	24
{D you know, } my husband was raised, {F uh, } -	24
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
{F Huh. }	15
<Throat_clearing> no.	36
{F Uh, } I worked in a nursing home	24
{C And, } how about the Rolling Stones?	7
{D Well, } -	26
That's right.	36
{F Uh, } let's see.	17
I'm sure.	21
{C But, } my husband works for an insurance company --	24
{D Well, } they were.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C But } I was driving home from work Friday,	24
{C and } they had [ a, + a ] woman who was a black belt in karate	24
what I meant was, four years equity costs five hundred dollars.	24
{D Like, } I haven't been down south.	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	36
{C but } it wasn't  anybody I'd really heard of.	24
{D Well, } one of the sad things is that so many of these never actually come to trial because [ of, + of ] the process in which the criminals were apprehended.	9
Uh-huh.	15
I was going to, -	24
{C And } there's a lot of men,  I don't know how many American, {F uh, }	24
I like the low notes better than the high notes.	24
[ I am, + {F uh, } I'm ] just starting to get into, {F uh, } a little bit more communications now.	24
{F Oh } yeah.	4
Oh.	15
we were pretty young	24
{C and } they do fire prevention work and (( certainly ))  things of that sort.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
<breathing> [ {C and } +  {C because, } ] it threw them forward,	24
{C and, } {D Well, } let's see,	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I like to read TIME  magazine and PEOPLE magazine to keep up with what's going on in the world.	24
Let's see, a good dinner party -- -- menu.	17
(( It's incentive )) ,	9
I'm sure there are some deep seated reasons, {D you know, } to, -	9
How old are your kids?	39
(( Give them ))  your pen number.   *[[sp: pin]]	18
{C and, } to have three in day care, {D you know, } even though one of them's in school full time, one of them's, {D you know, } in kindergarten.   *[[need a slash, should be sd ??]] That is a lot of money.   *[[slash err should be sv]]	13
yeah,	9
{F Uh, } I don't know.	19
{C and } I like  that a little bit better -- -- the variety of stitches and stuff in that.	24
we don't have a state inspection,	24
Yeah,	15
-- {C so } I bought one that's more like living in a, -	24
{D you know, } even though he brings in a real good living and everything, in order for me to keep up, I would have had to work.	24
Sure.	15
# {C and } # we dove there.	24
Really.	15
Yeah.	15
Once you get into the border, then there's a threat.	9
{C or. } -	26
{C and } I don't know  who's even proposing it, [ or, + or ] how they plan on implementing it, if they do.	24
Right,	15
We usually watch the local news and [ the, + the, ]  {F uh, } national news both.	24
{C But } I think that has a lot to  do with economic situation.	9
{C But } since I've been married and with a family, {F uh, } we have to go where there's restrooms <laughter>. And playgrounds, and so forth,	24
{C And, } I know where  you're coming from --	21
{D You know, } I wish they could have gotten a lottery.	24
All right.	13
Yeah.	15
Oh,	15
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } that's terrible.	21
{C but } a lot of times it's not being taught  in the home -- -- anymore like it used to be, basic respect for -- -- # for elders # -- -- # and # adults and particularly [ in, + in ] responsible  positions <noise>, [ have not, + {F uh, } I don't think have,  <breathing> had ] that basic <breathing> upbringing in a lot of cases	9
right.	11
{C and } you wait three months	9
{F oh, } and the running,	24
Uh-huh.	15
<laughter>,	20
# {D Well, } that's neat. #	21
yeah.	4
{F Ha, }  how about we end this?	7
Uh-huh.	15
I, mean, -	26
I had [ the, +  {F uh, }  the ] water pump break on my car.	24
Oh.	15
{C and, }  it's kind of nice because I've made money at it, too.	24
No,	33
<Child_talking> {F Uh, } {D well, } [ I, + I ] guess  it's a subject I haven't thought too much about.	24
{C Cause } I've been, {F uh, } -	26
{C And } the people that he got the  ((   ))  from, used to have cats	24
{C but } I wish, (( )) -	24
Right.	15
Yeah,	36
# Yeah,	4
{C So } we've been trying to get something or to pull some grass underneath there [ and, + and ] whatnot.	24
# Sure.  #	15
I'm not a die-hard fan	24
{C and } it was just, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
Okay,	38
{C but } he was always slick, and  greasy, and seemed to be conceited and  had more women than he needed	9
I'm not alarmed.	24
{F uh, } my fiancee is a very very good photographer.	24
<Laughter>.	20
You never miss one or whatever --	24
# Yeah,	36
it was exhilarating, {F uh, } for many years.	24
-- {C and } if it was up to her, we wouldn't have one.	24
Uh-huh.	15
# Right. #	15
# Uh-huh. #	15
{C And, } of course, you need a baby-sitter for that <laughter>.	9
{F Oh, } that's great.	21
Yeah.	15
{F Um, } {C because }  I'm usually so insulted by them I just hang up as soon as I recognize what, they are.	24
especially if you live on campus, and you don't have a car,  you just go crazy.	9
in to, {F uh, } -	26
[ I kind of, +   I ] haven't been keeping up with  football, {E I mean, } in the fall	24
there's this stuff called Wonder Under [ that you un-, +  that you iron ] it on	24
[ {C and, } + {C And, } ] {F uh, } <Laughter> {C So } that's, -	26
Yeah,	15
They gave them food and uniforms	24
Exactly <laughter>,	36
{C and } the movie had the whole, lot of philosophical content, [ [ more than, + more than, ] + ] {D you know, }	24
for the last, uh, couple of months.	24
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } I do too.	24
Uh-huh.	15
I, -	26
{F Um, } we've had a few down here,  but not anything like Kansas.	24
{F Huh. }	15
No,	36
{C And } they were just going to throw them away.	24
Then right,	15
<Laughter>.	20
{F Um, } yeah,	26
{C But } {F um } <lipsmack> I don't know	19
Yeah.	15
yeah.	15
{D Well, } I guess, [ I, + ] not trying to top  you, but I grew up in Dallas county and  I can remember when they built the north part of North  Central which was built after the south part of -- -- Central	24
<<Very faint>> Yeah.	4
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Right.	36
{C and } now their sons are.	24
isn't it.	23
{C or, } -	7
[ We're, + we're ]  retired now.	24
There's like two  aluminum plants #  ((   )) . #	24
yeah,	26
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.	15
I don't agree,	32
In fact, it's funny, #	24
They are a handful.	36
My last car repair actually had to do with brakes	24
"[ that's, + that's ]  a good one too.  Yeah,  *[[ Shouldn't that ""yeah"" be an indep. slash unit? ]]"	9
I think tickets are, -	9
Yeah,	15
{F Uh, } we were, {F uh, } really  surprised to  find that they're higher here.  # {F Uh, } #	24
{C And, } [ I, + I ] think you're right,	36
Are they driven by themselves.	7
{E I mean, } [ I, + ] not having any children, my husband was an Ohio State person,	24
I hope not.  {F Um, }	24
I think that, {F uh, } [ we, + we, ] -	9
{D So. }	26
#<Laughter>.#	20
{C but } it seems like [ you sure hear a, +  maybe you just hear a ] lot more about  them on the news	9
Right.	15
Uh-huh,	15
{F Um, } uh-huh.	15
# What do you use  ((   )) ? #	39
# Uh-huh. #	15
{C but } I think I  know what it is.	24
I've got [ a, + a ] six year old and a, {F um, } -	24
{F Oh, } sometimes,	11
I don't know if, -	26
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] all these other people are out running around.	24
pretty close.	24
{F uh } {C but } logically {F um } -	26
[ [ Is it, + is, ] + is it ] designed for punishment?	16
so. -	26
Yeah,	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } I [ felt, + felt ]  probably worse for them [ than, + than ] for me	24
Yeah,	4
{C And, }  {F uh, } [ I've found, + I've found ] that I pretty much become addicted to it	24
-- {C and, so } I decided, okay, I'll just, {D you know, } have them paint this little room, {D you know, } a little ten by ten dining area.	24
Yeah.	4
{C so } why go out and see something right away, {D you know, }	16
yeah.	36
sounds like it.	38
{D well, } good for you.	21
I think it's a bigger problem.  With the car pollution, anti-pollution devices,	9
Right.	15
I think a lot of, # -	26
{C and so } it looks to me like maybe their not catering to  this person's needs is really because this person [ is just, + {D you know, } is just ] in a state where they don't really need what they think they need, {D you know. }	9
{D Like } this was a really neat vital woman	24
I was hoping he was going to get Best Actor.	24
{C And } [[ her, + her ] husband's name is, + his last name is ] Weight.	24
<Throat_clearing>.	20
Uh-huh <throat_clearing>.	15
yes.	15
yeah,	15
Yeah.	15
{C but, } [ i-, + it ] seems in my experience  I'm running across single women all the time.	24
Yeah,	15
{C and } that was six years ago,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well } {C and } you have a  little bit better newspaper.	9
{F Um. } {F Oh, } no.	26
Uh-huh.	15
Right.	15
years ago my mother was that way.	24
{C and } it snowed on us.	24
I see.	15
I do too.	24
<Throat_clearing> No,	33
I'm  not overly proud of it,	24
{C and }  it helps the grass come back.	9
{C and } it's, {F uh, } real true that, {F uh, } {D you know, } they'll say one thing, to get elected,	9
{C and, } {F uh, } also, {F uh, } in one of my wife's, {F uh, } companies where she worked,  they'd had a real nice profit sharing plan [ that, +  that, ] -	24
Huh-uh.	15
That's, -	26
[ It, + it's ] just, {F uh, } try it out with their peers <breathing>.	9
{C And, } -	26
{C but, } {F uh, } I enjoy also working on things like the brakes	24
I'd always said I was going to go back to school and go to Notre Dame.	24
{F Uh, } {F um } so long as it's their possession.	22
{C And } <static> [ they, + they ] put this one out	24
Yes.	36
Uh-huh.	15
I did,	24
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	4
{F Uh, } {F uh, } seems like it was on a Friday,	9
It's just me and my sister.	24
{D Well, } have we spent our at least five minutes?	7
{C and, } it's just too much.	9
we like Grandy's, too.	24
{C And } you put  that in there,	18
they could [ p-, + probably ] do it again.	9
{C and so. } -	26
[ {C But, } + {F uh, } {C but } ] I've never looked into how much money they're spending.	24
That's what I'm hoping.	24
I guess we are just to discuss trials [ and, + and ]  punishment. If it's to be given by the judge or not.	24
No,	36
{F Huh. }	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	36
don't you think.	8
{C But, } {F oh, } {D well } <laughter>. -	26
<laughter> care provider. -	24
{F Oh, } I'm sure you'll get it done,	9
That would be true.	36
[ {C And } + {D see, } {C and then, } ] my mom and dad, {D like } whenever, {D like } we would go out and we would get a summer job, -	24
{C and } hobbies in our spare time is what we've been selected to discuss today.	24
Yeah,	36
they're real good.	9
<<Talking to someone in the room>> What are you saying? <<back to the phone>>	10
They actually pay you money for that?	7
It's really an illness, or whatever you want to say that it is.	9
{C But } I don't know about [ [ [ these, + {F uh, } these, ] + {F uh, } {F uh, } these  ] pincers, +  these,  now,  what are they called. [ Pit bulls, + pit bulls ] ] -- -- that are so vicious.	24
Fine.	6
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
{C and } the [ last year, +  last two years ] it seemed to go out really easily.	24
{D Well, } there's someone at the door	24
{F Oh, } really?	12
[ she was, + she is ] {D actually, } {F um, } -	26
Yeah.	4
Kind of scary when you think about that.	9
yeah.	15
# That's true <laughter>. #	36
{C and, } {F uh, } she had a SeVille  before that that had the odd backs [ that was, + that was ] so, {F uh, } -	24
{D Well, } [ I, + I ] never thought, of that benefit,	24
It's, {F uh, } {F oh, } about [ twenty-five thousand, + twenty-five hundred ]  square feet, # I guess.  #	24
{C but } they were losing a lot of, {F uh, } trees # and a lot of, # -	24
{D Well, } I think probably more people, {D you know, } would participate if they just made it a little easier,	9
I think they should check it to make sure that the signature at least matches, {D you know. }	9
{F oh, } that's neat,	21
I thought that was a very good movie.	9
{C and so } I really don't ever keep a program up consistently.	24
{D Well, } {F uh, } CITY SLICKERS, and STAR TREK FIVE.	24
No wonder you don't know that.	24
I don't know	34
it's just over  the overpass before you get {D like } to K-Mart.	24
# <Laughter>. #	20
Right.	36
I think, -	26
{D Well, } -- -- for some reason during the night, the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through	24
Uh-huh.	15
That's right,	36
{C but } other than that, you really don't know what's going on.	9
{C and } we used to go out with them and back then they had bought an  older Chris Craft	24
Uh-huh.	4
I like the idea of, {F uh, }  being, {F uh, } a mandatory thing for welfare.	24
<Child_talking> No,	36
<Phone_ringing>.	20
# Nothing like the fresh outdoors.  #	22
{C And } with that kind of a system my daughter just isn't likely to enjoy it if she has to good there immediately and lay down, on a cot.	24
{D Actually, } they picked up some from Minnesota.	24
{C but } there  are times when I sit there and I think, wow, {D you know } we make X amount of money and where is it.	9
Yeah.	15
{C and so } [ i-, + it's ] a real difficult  choice whether we want Styrofoam cups to fill up our landfills or, {F uh, } china cups to use up our water <laughter>.	24
I'm only up here for school.	24
Right,	36
{F Uh, } [ you just, + we're just ] happy that there's  trees already there so far,	17
Uh-huh,	15
Right.	15
{C So } I'm not exactly a real Twins fan from birth or anything.	24
They can if they choose to.	24
[ I felt like, +  I felt like ]  [ that was the worst impulse, +  [ that was, +  that was ] largest impulse ] [ that I, + that I ] had ever made.	24
Mine don't either,	24
{C But, } I really have enjoyed exploring children's literature because there's so  much more, {F uh, } new things out that, {D you know, }	24
{C And } that movie, [ I have to, +  I'll ] fast forward it every time they come to the part where there is, -	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } that's just it though, good education.	24
<Laughter>.	20
yeah,	30
-- {C but } it was a preponderance of them that caused our problem.	24
{D like } I had a great aunt,	24
Yeah.	15
{C So, } that, -	26
Yes,	15
Yes.	15
We had people down the street that the guy was in the reserves and he was just about ready to go and they [ have a, + just had  ] a new baby,	24
{C and then, } -	26
that really is.	9
{F Um, } {D well, } it's just that [ you have to have, + {F uh, } you have to ] be able to get your program in,	24
{C but } then I didn't vote -- -- {F uh, } I guess, in the two year for, {F uh, } some legislators and things	24
that's true.	36
Uh-huh.	15
I took one lesson one other time.	24
Uh-huh,	15
{C And, } {D you know, } I didn't move out of there until I was, {D you know, } twenty-seven	24
I'm retiring the end of this month --	24
{C But } the thing is, there's like eighty-six home games per year.	24
Yeah,	15
{C And } [ they're not, + {F um, } [ th-, + they ] don't ]  have the self-esteem that they need to have	9
{F Um, } [ she, + she ] breaks both of his ankles.	24
That's great.	21
{F Oh, } really.	12
No,	32
Here again, anytime anyone goes out with a gun in their hand and crime on their mind -- -- {F uh, } the opportunity exists for someone to get killed.	9
{C but } I haven't done it in so long that I probably wouldn't remember how <laughter>.	24
The national debt is terrible.	9
{C and then } when the bill actually comes in, I go ahead and fill in the actual amount.	24
No,	36
It's just. -	26
It's not, {D you know, } in the same category.	24
We got one of those kind that have got the, -	24
{F Uh, } I don't know,	19
Yeah.	15
<Laughter> {D Well, } that was, {D you know, }  [ with a, + with a ] circular saw.	3
{C and, } -	26
basically, the restrictions are just to penalize the good guys because the bad guys are going to get the guns anyway	9
{C So. } -	26
Vol-, -	26
{C but } the bats eat the bad spiders	24
I think it's going to be a luxury item to be able to stay home with your kids.	9
<Laughter>.	20
{C But } your humidity is different though than ours I think,	24
-- {D like, } {D you know, } you [ go + say ] okay, we can't bring up this point because then they're going to, {D you know, } -	24
I'm only in my late   twenties now,	24
{C So } I said, {D well, } {F gee, } this is pretty much like Texas.	24
{C so } it's like in the low forties right now.	24
Uh-huh,	15
{C because } <clicking>, -	26
It, -	26
Gosh.	21
Yeah.	15
That's true.	36
{C So, } we've got a private lake,	24
She was like the glue,	24
Yeah.	15
-- {F oh, } the music in that was fantastic.	9
{D Well, } [ I, + we ] have always had ours in a park or something.	24
{C But } by no means do I endorse or approve pulling everybody out.	24
I think our courts have too many  opportunities for them to go back and get one more chance.	9
Yeah,	36
Okay.	38
they just raised it to twelve.	24
{D well, } any time we had a school vacation or something like that we went down to Los Angeles,	24
Huh-uh.	15
-- does that make since to you?	7
Yeah.	15
a lot of times,	24
that's an excellent idea.	21
Yeah,	15
He had a couple of them bombarded.	24
{C Because } I don't # want # -- -- stubs in my lawn.	24
We have one earth, to live on	9
# Absolutely. #	36
yeah,	15
[ they, + they ] gave the guys, {F uh, } the power and the material and  [ the, + ] told them to go do it and they did it.  {D You know, } got in and got out.	9
[ {C and, } +  {D you know. } {C But } ] that must have been tremendously difficult to orchestrate.	9
{C and } they did.	24
{C but } I think it was probably [ a, + an ] individual ferret thing,  because  [ it was f-, + it was a fairly ] wild ferret.	9
the nam-, -	26
we have many tornadoes spawned in this area.  And northern Indiana,	24
{C or } [ do, + is ] it talk shows.	35
Uh-huh.	15
I'm, {F uh, } management level {F uh, } facilities,	24
{D you know, } they don't pick up your recycling until <noise>  it's full	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } <inhaling> they had curbside recycling,	24
You set down.	24
go ahead.	18
-- {C and then } you pay that off and don't use it until, {F uh, } it's paid off.	24
is she having problems,	25
{C but, } {D like } if you're going to do business in another country, you've got to respect their rules.	9
{C but } I should get paid at least double what my husband makes <laughter> working in an office for staying home --	9
{C and } they want to charge twenty thousand dollars for it.	9
that's what ours is.	24
it's Cajun type stuff.	24
I know that,  {F uh, }	24
we have, {F um, } assistants to the general counsel	24
I used to go with my brother.	24
{C And then, } all the sudden, it disappeared, {D you know } <laughter>.	24
[ {C and, } +  {C and } ] [ I, + {D you know, } I ] still provide most of the things that go on around the house.	24
{C but } he tries to go,	24
they're not breaded	24
{C and } ugh,	21
{F {C and } } wasn't it pretty  last week with the # Bluebonnets and everything,	7
{C so, } -	26
I think that's really true.	36
{D Well } then, I guess I'll let you go  so you can go get the door	38
Which, a lot of places make you work like  ten years or so, # before # you get that much.	9
Uh-huh.	15
-- that, {F uh, } <<pause>> in addition to getting a new car there, they can get you a car that's new	24
Right now we don't have cable.	24
it, -	26
{C and } there are still people who don't have # power. #	24
{C but } it's # -- -- very quiet and very smooth riding machine.	24
{E I mean, } {D like, } I'm real tall,	24
{C but } somehow we get back there.	24
{C And } my insurance [ is about, + it was running about ] four hundred dollars a year.	24
They didn't call them closets.	24
[ I, + I  ] always wonder about that [ when, + when  ] someone does repairs or little things like that, {F uh, }	24
{C and then, } {D you know, }  you could, -	26
We did not have to call [ on, + on ] someone else,	24
{C and } I figured she'd like  THELMA AND LOUISE better	24
{C so } -- -- he's, -	26
Wow.	21
{F Um. }  We haven't had that big a scandal in Arlington,	24
# It was # [ al-, + almost ] always at least one cat,  sometimes, {D you know, } like  fifteen or twenty.  But, {F uh, } always cats in the house.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } then with, {F uh, } {F uh, } the defense, with [ Bruce Smi-, + Bruce Smith ] there at linebacker there, they've got a very well rounded team	9
somebody can not be colonel	9
{C So, } {F oh, } that's great that you have them.	9
The one's that, {F uh, } go along with that,  they are sure of themselves.	9
But,  -	26
{C so } we don't.	24
{D well, } {F um, } thanks  for hearing me rap, I guess <laughter>.	38
{E I mean, } hire a professional,	24
In fact, my mother once tore up our entire back yard <laughter>, and redid it.	24
Do you feel that it has improved the way you feel?	7
Yeah.	15
{C but } I think there's a lot that [ we, +  the public ] doesn't need to know.	9
{F Oh, } that's a beautiful place.	24
I don't know <laughter>.	19
some places still it seems like it's a social club.	9
I guess I'd would like to see somebody like Yeltsin to get more power.	24
She's just, -	26
Yeah,	4
huh-uh.	33
It would have been another planet to kind of take over and, {F uh, } continue on.	9
{D So. } -	26
{D Now } [ what's, + what's ] toning?	39
I'm talking about national campaigns.	24
-- {C and } I am home on furlough.	24
I think we've had, one, two, three -- -	24
They're probably # <laughter>  ((   )) . # -	26
<Laughter>  Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } {D well, } nothing will happen.	24
{C And } rebuild from nothing.	2
{C but } I don't as much as I should know about it	24
[ Wh-, +  what ] kind of time frame  is it, {F uh, } looking for the, {F uh, } different shifts up there?	39
<Laughter>.	20
I've read some of it.	9
now that it has a national edition, I read that.	24
{C but } good thing they had their gun on them	9
and that it's mostly sales tax, -	9
Huh.	15
Right.	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C But, }  {F uh, } [ it's, +  it's ] a [ nice, +  nice ] hobby to have.	24
I've often wondered if it doesn't come back to [ the, + the ] home environment.	24
{C And } it was a lifetime appointment for her  as well as for him.	24
and he seems to enjoy it.	9
{C And } it seemed like we didn't have  enough money when things cropped up, {D you know, }	9
they had, {F uh, } a new Chevy Suburban, truck, {D you know, }	24
{C and } I think, {D you know, } eventually, {D you know, } he'll be [ of, +  of ] drafting age.	24
There is a lot of theft, a lot of  assault dealing with, {F uh, } people trying to get money for drugs.	24
{F Oh, } okay.	29
{F Oh, } how neat.	21
And, {D you know, } just in one lump,	24
it was about four or five hundred square feet.	24
That's right.	36
he says, somebody's taking you for a ride.	24
{C and } your whole body aches, {D you know. }	24
now grapes are the ones that you  have to pull all that off,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and, } I really loved it.	24
That [ cou-, + would ] have been  something.	9
It is absolutely delicious.	9
It's pretty lax about, {F um, } {D you know, } -	24
<breathing>	20
yeah,	36
{F Oh } it added up big.	36
[ {C and, } +  {C and } ] actually  I agree, except that I don't trust the people who are appointed to vote <laughter>.	24
Go, # ahead, #	18
{D So } what kind of weather have  you had in Dallas?  <Laughter>.	39
The fact that they take our money and don't do what we think  is right makes them thieves.	9
Ca-, -	26
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
[ if you, + if you ] put someone to death you obviously, can't reform <laughter> them.	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C and, }  {F uh, } it's that grandmother figure, not only raising her own children, but raising, {F um, } children from the streets, too, frequently.	24
{C So, } [ at least, +  at least ] that will be exciting <laughter> -- -- when we get that,	9
I'm old enough now where George Orwell, -	24
{F Um, } I'm glad to see that,	24
Yeah,	15
My grandmother did.	24
-- {C and, } {F uh, } I'm trying to think,	17
-- {C and } it's just easier to say,  {D you know, } just put that on my credit card.	9
Okay,	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C And, } {F uh, }  ((   ))  impressed with {D actually. }	24
{F Um, } I used to play trombone <laughter>.	24
# Uh-huh,	15
{D So, } {F uh, } {F uh, } what are the laws like in Texas?	39
it's been cold.	24
Uh-huh.	15
And, uh, so you know it keeps us pretty busy as you know.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } # you know how it is.	8
I think [  those gu-, + those little ] V eights could have been made to be pretty powerful little engines, if they would have gone with it,	9
Yeah,	4
Yeah.	15
{C Because } it does, -	26
{C and } it shows up.	9
the next year  [ our, + our ] son Ken went to Hawaii	24
{C but, } {F uh, } {F uh, } I'm more interested in that.	24
{D well } {D see } {D now, } with our jobs mainly  hitting downtown Dallas we couldn't go too much further,	24
{C but } it was <breathing>,	26
Right.	15
{C so } I keep, -	26
<Laughter>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
that's cute. #	9
There were a couple downtown Dallas	24
<Laughter>.	20
{E I mean, } there is a night and day difference between good doctors and bad doctors, and good hospitals and bad [ doc-, + ] hospitals.	9
{F Uh, } {D well } I haven't tried that.	34
# Punishment.  #	2
That's what I ha-,  {D you know, } -	26
Yeah.	15
<laughter>.	20
Sounds like it.	21
{C and } [ it, +  it ] handled real well,	9
{F Uh, } suits and sports coat, tie and the whole bit. Cause you go to meetings and you are required to look your best and look professional of course.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } they routinely use [ them for bait for, + {F uh, } goldfish for bait -- -- for  ] yellow catfish.	24
Yeah,	4
{C so } got a lot of fumes from, {F uh, } trucks -- -- and cars	24
{E I mean } it was all right,	9
<Talking> {F Oh, } {D boy, } this is going to be tough, I'm in Plano <laughter>.	24
{F Uh, } {C and } one way you know that is that only God can afford it # <laughter>. #	9
There are a number of good movies like that.	9
Bye --	38
It's, {F uh, } something we're really irritated about around here.	24
[ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C but } ] we kind of take our food for three days,	24
My check, weekly, buys groceries and gas and -- -- {D you know, } that kind of thing <laughter> --	24
{E I mean } it's, -	26
it's kind of l-, -	26
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] [ I, + I ] [ s-, + saw ] an episode of the T V show, COPS -- -- {F uh, } one time that was in Pittsburgh,	24
{C and } # we did it # --	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	4
for, everyone knows what we're talking about,	9
Yeah.	36
Yeah.	15
{C but } they wanted to be independent as well. Have their own room.	24
Sure.	15
be everything, be supermom,	2
{C So } that was a wonderful vacation.	9
{C so, } # -	26
{F Oh, } that, -	26
{D Well, } with the minorities {C and } we are saying we have lower voter turnout.	9
Yeah.	15
Joey, on the other hand is a little different.	24
it's so quiet, almost can't tell the engine is running.	24
{F um, } my husband had originally wanted an  ((   )) -	24
# {D So } it's good talking to you. #	38
Uh-huh.	15
{F Huh. }	15
They're crazy	9
Yeah,  {D exactly. }	36
You too.	38
{F Uh, } <laughter> I guess you have not  reached the stage where you need to, {F uh, } promote a college or anything,  {F huh. }	8
Uh-huh.	15
Durn.	21
{C and } they get together	9
On the weekends I drive around,  look to see, {D you know, } who is selling what.	24
Uh-huh.	36
are you in your thirties,	7
{C and } I haven't lately <laughter>.	24
{D Now, } that's because [ he was, + he's doing ]  a lot of it himself -- -- [ and, + ] {D you know, } for example,  landscaping [ and, + and ] lots of the other stuff,	24
{F uh, } [ Sat, + {F uh, } Sunday ] afternoon -- -- or, {F uh, } sometimes it has been like on a  Saturday afternoon.	24
[ I've actually, + I've ] [ known, + known ] some people that have had their cars stolen.	24
Yeah,	15
they made a position for them  some where.	24
Of course, I, {F uh, } -	26
{C But } what happens is you don't mess with us, we won't mess with you,	9
{C and } they're selling, {D you know, } {D you know, } -	24
Uh-huh.	15
# {C And } # I lived over in England for four years,	24
I mean it was a real consciousness raiser,  I guess.	9
She also works --	24
# Yeah. #	15
# Uh-huh. #	15
[ {C but, } +  {C but, } ]  {F uh, } no,	26
{C And } they've got better closet space.	9
I have a question to ask you about gardening though.	24
Okay.	15
{C but } it would be more of a family setting.	9
{D So, } it sounds like [ you, + {F uh, } you ] think [ that, + that ] we'd be able to save some money by, {F uh } -- -- passing the line item veto.	22
Yeah.	36
{C and } we do some teaching  of sailing with the scouts,	24
Yes <laughter>.	36
seems like the whole group of city employees that's raising a stink over it. -	24
They're supposed to represent us.	9
{C And, }  {F uh, } same here, {F uh, }	24
{C and } if I wanted to read, I wanted to read something light and relaxing [ and -- + -- and, ] {F uh, } things like that	24
{C and, }  {F uh, } it's got this wonderful French actor who's, -	24
-- {C and } she sends them to me,	24
{F Oh, } uh-huh.	15
We had,	26
{C and } that is the best book to go through, those NATIONAL -- -- GEOGRAPHIC.	24
No.	33
{C and } {D like } some banks, {D you know, } they're limited to the types of loans that they're allowed to make.	24
{C and } they came back	25
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } that's, -	26
Yeah.	26
# I can hardly # wait in the mornings for the # newspaper # -- -- to get here,  {D you know. }	24
Even though they didn't bring it in, they help it once it's there.	9
# Yeah,	15
What is the favorite thing you do with your children?	39
Uh-huh.	15
Maybe they run a lot of other tests,	24
Right.	15
Yeah,	36
[ It, + it's ] really obvious to look at them  and watch the way they act and things. # That,  # {F um, } <lipsmack> they've   been raised in a day-care center.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } I noticed that, my kids are, {F uh, } older now,	24
{F Um. }	15
<Laughter>.  # {D Well, } good for him. #	21
Whereas in the paper, I like to read the articles because they get every side, every single side,	9
{D You know, } that, -	26
Sometimes in January it's not too comfortable to play.	24
Yeah.	15
{D so } {F um, }  I'm going to leave you alone.	37
{F Um, } {D well, } I'm certainly in  favor of AIDS research,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } [ it, + it ] just, -	26
Uh-huh.	4
it's not just like one instance, or something, it's just, {F uh, } horrifying, some of the murders that go on.	9
Right.	36
Wouldn't have thought of it	9
it takes me about four and a half hours [ to do, + to mow ] our grass.	24
{D Well, } {F um, } the last car  (( we )) bought was  American [ because  of, + because of ] that reason,	24
{C and, } -	26
{F Oh, } no.	21
-- have not been to Spain.	24
{F Oh, } my heavens.	21
I hadn't thought much about that,	24
# Uh-huh.  #	15
He, i-, -	26
is it, -	26
<Laughter>.	20
{F Oh, } yes. Yeah.	4
it's always been that way.	24
{C And } I didn't realize it,	24
{D Well, } it nearly killed me <laughter>.	24
yeah,	15
It would be difficult,	9
those machine guns # and all that. #	22
{C and } [ I, + surprisingly enough after four years, I'm ] not tired of the car at all	24
<laughter>.	20
{C But, } -	26
Then, -	26
# Used those for, # {F uh, } # mulch,	2
right <noise>.	15
Yeah. #	26
[ {C and, } + {D you know. }  {F Uh, } {C and } ]  the [ rea-, + reason ] I [ was, +  ((   ))  picked ] it back up was in light of [ all the, + {F uh, }  ((   ))  {D Well } when they found [ the, +  {F uh, } the ] ] airplanes [ on the, +  in the ] Atlantic, thinking they  were Flight Nineteen.	24
{C but } we make sure that we just do not buy unless we really can see how we're going to pay for it ahead --	24
<laughter>, okay.	15
we weren't going fast enough acco-, -	24
How are your kids handling it?	31
I had an aunt who lived in a small town in Texas that, {F um, } was in a, -	24
{C and } if that's true, [ that's, + ] {F um, } it might be better off to have that as a second card  just to have the credit. And get rid of the American Express   because it costs so much.	24
I think so.	11
It could very easily be supported with facts.	9
{E I mean, } it's kind of, -	24
That's right,	21
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah.	30
{C So } [ why + <laughter>, why ] am I waiting, {D you know, }	25
{D Well, } it is, the hardest thing I've ever done, as much as you'd go out	24
# [ not that # it's, + not that it's ]  better	9
<laughter>  Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
yeah.	15
That's probably more true than, a lot of people realize.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } {D well, } I can.	36
Sure it does.	36
{C So } instead, we spend billions of dollars going to war.	9
{C but } I haven't since  I've been out of school.	24
# Yeah	15
Right.	15
{C But, }  {E I mean, } time wise, how long,	39
you go out to get the chicken wings	24
{F Uh, } {D well, } right now we have one dog inside.	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ Would you, +  would you ] agree with that?	7
{F Uh, } I remember, {F uh, } [ I've, +   I've ] worked since I was, -	24
{C And, } {F um, } <breathing> [ the, + the ] -	26
{C But } it was silly.	9
Yeah.	15
[ {C and, } +  {C and } ] part of me says I just would like to, {D you know, } shut my eyes  and pretend it doesn't, {D you know, } go on <sigh>.  Or send them to private  schools <sigh>.	24
{C and } the Navy is sending him for his Masters in Ocean Engineering --	24
I just love it.	24
-- {C and } I've told so many stories about the snakes --	24
Yeah.	15
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] you can influence the way things are.	9
{D So, } what's the latest one you've read?	39
[ it's al-, + # # it's mostly ] religious anyway. #	2
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } you know, what's pretty cute {D actually. }  {F Um, }	16
I know this sounds like a Texas story,	24
{C and } you can say something	9
I think it's pretty darned good,	9
Uh-huh.	15
[ Did, +  did ] you play [ a, +  a ]  strong role in helping them pick schools	7
when I was down in Dallas for two years, I had, {F uh, } my children come home from school with papers that were corrected by the teacher that had words spelled correctly marked wrong, and words spelled wrong not marked as such.	24
I've heard of, -	24
at least it's with one person --	9
{D Well, } {D actually } that's a, -	26
{C and, } {F uh, } I don't think that's a problem.	24
yeah. #	15
Yes.	15
{C but } I sure don't think it's attractive, {D you know. }	9
{C and } I've got three cards.	24
-- I know that part, probably half their money comes from these people that are saying, {F uh, }  Put my ad in your paper -- -- and I'll pay you or whatever,	24
{C and } I put it in parenthesis.	24
I was really tired of, {F uh, } the Michael Bolton.	24
Yeah.	36
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	15
{C And } I told him -- -- he's going to have to get a part-time job by the time he reaches # teenage years # -- -- so # he can eat. #	24
that's a lot of money.	9
{D So, } do you think you get good coverage from the sources that you have?	7
{F Oh, } okay.	15
{C And, }  {F uh, } that's like when my mo-, -	24
You got the term.	36
[ you don't, + you don't ] go buy it from a wholesaler.	8
Yeah.	15
#  What kinds of things do you fix?	39
{D Well, } I really don't know.	34
{C And } [ she, + {D you know, } she ] finds all the outlets and all the discount places  and, {F uh, } buys clothes.	24
{F Uh, } apparently, {D you know, } [ there's, + they haven't, ] {F uh, } executed anybody since nineteen sixty-seven, I believe.	24
# Yeah. #	15
{C and, } of course, {D you know, } I can't speak  to the rural or poorer inner city schools,	24
that's a Four Eighty-Six processor, too?	7
Yeah,	4
[ It's, + it's ] probably not dissimilar from [ [ [ [ the, + {F uh, } {A what are they, } the, ] + the, ] + the, ] + {A I'm trying to think of the name of the, } the  ((   )) ] , something like that in Northern Iraq -- -- who are actually countrymen of, -	9
Uh, I, I haven't run across any major pollutants down there that I've, I've really seen a lot of, you know, ((upsettedness)) about.	24
# I # thought that would be good experience for me.	24
[ {C but, } +   {C but } ] some people don't have a choice.	24
[ Which, + ] {F uh, } {E I mean } if  you're, {F uh, } sending two thousand dollars that way every year, you, {F uh, }  watch what goes on and you, {F uh, } {F uh, } pay attention and participate	9
{C or } he, I guess it was a male, he ran off twice,	24
{C and } the high was only fifty,	24
Or Dye Community.	24
{E I mean, } any other time of year,  that's not the case, because it could be very warm or very cold.	24
It was tough,	24
{F Uh, } I think that, {F oh, }  politicians talk a lot about waste --	9
Big solid pieces of oak are just -- -- tough.	9
No,	33
{C and }  in all honesty, -	24
I thought {D well, } now men, {D you know, } have to fight to be equal.	9
# {D Well } {D you know } if # we can keep them in school. -	9
{C But, }  [ what, + what ] Paul Simon's doing, I think [ [ is, + is, ] + is ] great because he's, {D you know } [ [ I think, + I think ] that + ] using, {A I guess what they call it is eclectic, } {D you know. } drawing from a lot of different sources and making, {D you know, } a synthesis of a new type of music.  {F Um, }	9
Just, I can't seem to get over that.	24
[ You're going, + {F oh, } you are going ] to school? At B Y U,	7
{C and # so } # -- -- she was able to come back home	24
# [ it's, + it's, ] # [ like, + like ] two hours of output or something like that.	9
{D well, } {D see, } the entire bank is not like that.	24
{C So, }  when you see something that's  on recycled paper, they've actually gone to a lot of expense to do that.	24
Yeah.	15
Right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C so } -- -- I have been there quite a bit	24
Uh-huh.	15
# Uh-huh.  #	15
{F Oh, } at least,	36
{C So } she stopped for awhile.	24
{C and, } [ {C so, } + {C so } ]  I guess, I've seen it done	24
{C and } I've been happy ever since.	24
<Laughter> I don't know,	19
Yes,	36
Okay,	36
{D Well, } not in the morning,	5
yeah.	15
{C and } [ one, + [ you can, + you can ] only build it in one ] place, {D you know, }	24
Yeah.	15
I personally took a year and a half and went as a missionary and taught Christianity in Japan.	24
{C So } really his salary should be, {D you know, } twenty percent or thirty percent higher -- -- just based on that, not including -- -- the fact that {D you know, } it's a [ less, + ] long term commitment for the company -- -- and all that sort of stuff.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } I have never skied before,	24
I think, -	26
I'm probably going back there to work, for a year.	24
{C or } did it come out in the, -	7
Yeah,	36
I usually just buy a pattern book.	24
{C And, } {D you know, } [ it, + it ] [ doesn't, + doesn't ] hurt every once in a while to have them done professionally too	9
[ Whether that, + whether that ] should be put in the hands of the corporation or [ [ the, + the hands of ] + the, hands of ] the government is [ [ a, + {D you know, } a, ] + a ] different question I think, as far as I'm concerned.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
I can't say constant  down here in Texas that you wear these boots. -	24
send it to this address,	9
-- {C and } you would think, {D you know, } {F uh, } being, {F uh, } an American or whatever, {D you know, } a foreigner there that, that would be all the more reason that they'd take advantage of you.	9
How about you?	31
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
yeah --	26
Uh-huh.	4
[ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {C and } ] we did aerobics together for about a month and a half	24
{C But } [ [ it's, + it's   pretty, ] + it's  ] fun to play.	24
{C But } [ when was, + {F uh, } when she was ] here last summer we played tennis	24
{D Like, }  He wrote TROUT FISHING IN AMERICA	24
[ {C And } I, + {C and } I ] think that I don't.	9
{C And so } I often drop in on a break  [ and -- + -- and ] read it.	24
{F Uh, }	17
{C So, } {D you know, } if, -	26
he   had an affair,	24
Uh-huh.	15
definitely.  #  *[[slash error]] # Were safe.  #   *[[slash error]]	13
{C and } they had, {F uh, } some names, some companies that sold mustang parts,	24
{F Oh, } uh-huh.	15
We do a lot of traveling around.	24
Uh-huh,	15
{C so } I think she was, {D you know, } bad, {F uh, }  nutrition on top of it.	24
[ there, + there  ] must be some sort of deep seeded reason for that,	9
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
She could just as easily do those things by hand.	9
I just, -	26
Right,	15
yeah. #	15
Oh.	15
{D Well, } [ that, + that ] makes sense, it really does.	9
you try to go and take a vacation every year and go out and camp?	7
{F Oh, } [ there's, + there's ] some nice things in Baltimore, {D you know, }	24
Ever go up in Pennsylvania in the mountains	7
Yeah.	15
[ for, + for ] years there has been an idea batted around of having some sort of alternative, {F uh, } public service for, {F uh, } young people to go into, {F uh, } after high school.	24
Oh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
-- she had been at the beginning [ the, + the ] intelligent one, [ the, + the ] one who always solved the things [ and, + and ] figured out and kept Max from getting real messed up.	24
{C and } I've got new ideas,	24
For heaven's sake.	21
{C and, } {F uh, } [ we, + they ] have a recycling truck that comes around now	24
{E I mean, } {D like } personally, I don't want to clean my, -	24
I don't know.	34
{E I mean, } I can't help but wonder [ if, + if ] I grew up without a father, on the streets, and -- -- with {D like } little or no money, [ wouldn't -- + -- wouldn't ] I be in prison ((at this point))?	9
I sure do.	11
Uh-huh.	15
{C But } some of them don't want those freedoms I think.	9
-- yeah	15
{C and } they were just starting to learn,	24
{D Now } [ my, + one of my ] sisters is down here.	11
{D So } that works okay for me.	24
I think, {F uh, } it is the Congress and them just don't have any interest in saving us money, {F uh, }	9
Yes,	15
Uh-huh.	15
# {D Well } why? #	39
{C So } I would say one thing.	24
part of me is wary	24
{D you know, } they backed down on that.	24
Uh-huh,  {F uh. }	15
There's just my husband and I,	24
{D Well, } {D see } that is me with the newspaper. Especially financial page.	24
<Sigh> I've been there.	24
I think there's always some threat.	9
# {F Oh, } yeah.  #	15
{D Well, } okay, <laughter>.	25
{C so, } {F uh, } [ it's, + it's ] in the same old [ y-, + ] {D you know, } routine of, {F uh, } {D you know, } doing homework and, {D you know, } trying to talk between all of that [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } the other activities that we all have.	24
{C and } then you took it off  and put it on the tree,	24
{C and } now I don't have such a bad view of nursing homes anymore.	24
Uh-huh.	15
I don't think switching back  and forth is that big a deal.	9
I've read so many different things about  diapers	24
{C and then } with that I try and handle, {D you know, } some of the clothes that the girls need -- -- and things like that,	24
This was like everybody came into town and went to this restaurant.	24
the older stuff is the best of it.	9
{C and } they just went from generation, # probably # to generation, # just [ with # these, + with these ] all passing it from one to the other.	9
Have you gone out to, {F uh, } Fort Worth to see the [ space, + Soviet space ] exhibit?	7
this friend of mine grew up on a farm and said that she had,  {F uh, } a pet cow named Rosebud	24
{C And } that was, {D you know, } prior to World War Two.	24
bye-bye.	38
{E I mean } that's the point we all should be at, is {D like } finding some solution,	9
I didn't care too much  for the last one either.	24
I hear that the major automobile manufacturers  are looking at nonpolluting cars	24
it just kind of -- -- dragged on.	9
{F Uh, } {C and } it, {F uh, } -	26
# Uh-huh. #	15
<Laughter>.	20
I think tha-, -- -	26
No,	33
The violence can seem very realistic,	24
I said, {D you know, } it's either me or the dog,	24
Probably my favorite is, {F um, } {F oh, } -	26
<Laughter>.   *[[slash error]]	20
[ any-, <laughter> -more, + ]  {C and } whenever anybody comes  over, we all have to show him Domino <laughter>  (( {D you know } )) .	24
That's, {F uh, } {D you know, } inside the mall	24
you have a bonus?	7
Yeah,	36
I know that they, {F uh, } have capital punishment for certain crimes,	24
Uh-huh.	15
, isn't (( Tigon )) , {F uh, } part of G T E or vice versa or something like that.	7
Yeah.	15
Here in Saskatoon at least, the majority of central, {F uh, } -	24
Uh-huh.	15
Right,	36
it really is	9
Yes.	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } [ it's, + it's ] just marvelous,	24
I think they finally decided not to because they figured that stretch of highway was going to get trashed <laughter>.	24
Right.	15
I, -	26
{C and } they've been looking and looking	24
(( They can just ))  subtract it from your bill,	24
{C So } once,  they've gotten the penalty and there is no doubt, do it,  {D you know, }	9
Uh-huh.	4
-- it's the way they make additional money.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C But } [ when, + when ] the company goes bankrupt, {E I mean, } [ the, + they're ] just cut off completely	9
{C and } [ they were never, + they never ] harmed her.	24
{F Um, } as far as dealing with divorce?	7
Right.	15
# {C So } I can # see where [ that, + that, ] may be a problem.	9
# It is. #	36
I don't know how you felt when you were home and what kind of feedback you got,	24
I can't, {F uh, } believe you're so far away,	24
{C but } I'm open to try anything, {D you know. }	24
They [ just, + just, ] -	24
{C and } he threw up again	24
I was trying to think,	17
yeah,	36
<Sniffing> Of course, we wouldn't have the retail market we have either	9
co-, # -	26
{C but }  ((   )) , -	26
Of course, you just threw it away.	24
{C And } it keeps the family alive, # [ even, + {D you know, } even ] # though it's very fluid.	24
One.	30
I just deal with them on the telephone,	24
{C So, } -	26
<Laughter>.	20
{C and } I've made it a few times.	24
{C and then } you have their birth date on them,	24
{C and then } all of, a sudden you get your thirty a week because now, their advertising you.	9
My wi-, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
I had seen the advertisement for FLATLINERS on T V,	24
<Laughter>.	20
{F Uh, } who wants to start this one?	39
yeah.	26
{C but } -- -- long as you didn't spin the tires  too much [ or, + or ] spend too much time with the secondaries kicked in it,  it didn't do too bad on gas.	24
I guess I did not.	24
{C and } we've been breeding them.	24
{C And, } [ I, + I'm ] the same way as your husband is when it comes to my car,  I hate to go pay somebody good money, {D you know, }	24
I'd just as soon have [ the, + the ] police story without all the romance.	24
{C but } it's tuition, full tuition paid if your parent works at T C U.	24
{D Well, } I guess we probably talked just about long enough.	9
Yeah.	15
that's great.	21
I tape it.	11
It's taken a long time to break away, [ from, + from ] that --	24
uh-huh.	4
Uh-huh.	15
{C so, } it diff-, {D you know, } -	26
Yeah.	15
uh-huh.	15
[ [ [ [ I, +  I,  ] +  I, ] +  I think, ] +   I think ] there's a lot to be said for kids working -- -- after school.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } he has an apartment,	24
right.	36
I enjoyed it.	38
<Throat_clearing>.	20
are you interested [ in, + in ] computers?	7
They need it,	9
Yeah.	15
Actually, the wall behind the paper was smooth	24
used to go on, -	24
Seems like most of ours are occurring in late at night [ or, + or, ] like I say, drug related.	24
[ I, + I ] # do not wish my time to come.	24
Uh-huh.	15
but it was right at, -	24
{C So } we were,	24
okay.	15
{C Because } even though we do get the story right away, they were censored as to what they -- -- could tell us.	9
{C So, }  you had the dogs before you had the baby?	7
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } [ it, + it  ] makes you more aware of what you're eating.	9
-- {C and } [ then pop-u-, + ] is it pop-up?	7
{C and } I think that's why there is so many problems -- -- {D you know, } with kids today,	9
[ {C And, } + {F um, } {C so } ] he worked on that for the longest time, ever since school <laughter> was out on Friday,	24
by the way, I'm, {F uh, } an [ R  V, + full time R V -er, ]	24
{C and } they're watching something worthwhile, while I can make dinner and do things I need to do -- -- without them under foot.	24
[ I was, +  I go ]  to school, too, at night	24
no,	33
that was its most [ personal, + personal, ] {F uh, } pollution that I can think of.	9
[ I, +  I  ] read that recently somewhere,	24
it does,	36
{C but } when I was employed with the school district, I didn't have maternity leave either	24
{C and } I just like it where it's deep enough, {D you know, }  but not <laughter> too deep.	24
{F Oh, } I know.	36
yeah.	36
That is the disadvantage.	9
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
He had to look at himself.	24
[ [ I d-, + I do, ] + I do ]  know a few people and [ have been, + have done ] some business up in Baltimore,	24
That's very cool.	21
Yeah.	15
When they're so cheap too at the video stores that you can. -	9
Yeah <laughter>.	15
{C So } they just try and make it a  personal thing,	9
{D you know, } I keep a little box at my desk, {D you know, }	24
Because [ it's, + I think it's ] gotten just care-, {D well, } -	9
{C and }  they wouldn't have to pay him,	24
{F Uh, }	15
Uh-huh.	15
Right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
I'm trying to think what else is on television,	24
Right.	15
Yeah.	4
# Right. #	15
When you did your papering did you start in the middle of the wall?	7
he gets, -	26
[ {C And } how about the, + {C And } how about the ] person in, {F uh, } Houston?	39
Yeah.	15
(( There )) . -	26
{C And } the library will take glass.	24
he doesn't get, {D well } -- -	24
{D like } one was a warring tribe,	24
this is kind of a, {F um, } -	26
{C So } [ we're going to, + they're going to ] stay there.  Which is fine, because Arlington's got a lot of things to offer.	24
{C so } I was there longer,	24
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh,	15
often, {F uh, } when I get around to doing it, then [ I, + I ] feel better when I get back to # work # --	24
{C but } {D doggone } if they can't just put it together, {F uh, } {D you know, } -	24
Yeah.	15
<Throat_clearing>.	20
Okay.	15
{D You know, } {C so } that would probably be nice if we could ever get something like that	9
{C But } her hair, -	26
{C and } [ we used to eat there, + we used to eat there ] all the time.	24
I do plant a lot of beans, because it seems like, the, {F uh, } bugs get on them so easily	24
Uh-huh.	15
uh-huh.	15
That experience was awful <groan>.	24
{C and } I'm glad to see there haven't been any this year.	24
{C so } they're going to put it in the video.	24
Yeah,	15
[ Th-, + that ] goes back to when,  {F uh, } America was [ a, + a ] colony of England.	24
he'll be three in January.	24
<Laughter>.	20
-- {F uh, } actually I grew up in Alabama,	24
{D Well, } {D you know, } what they say  about the weather here in Texas?	7
That's right,	36
Bye-bye.	38
{C but } if it's just -	26
Thursday nights usually had pretty good, [ with that, + ] and as far as very good comedy.	9
You can always refuse	24
{C and } -- -- I hope you get back into camping again, and do a little more of it.	38
{C And } I told my husband, that's the whole point,	24
It seems to mellow them or something.	9
I think the company still exists.	24
[ they, +  every year they ] look at, {F uh, } different areas and try to determine  [ where, + where, ] {F uh, } the most houses will be,	24
Yeah,	15
there's Six Flags right by the stadium, there's a Wet 'n Wild	24
[ don't, + don't ] be in any hurry.	18
Yeah.	15
# {C but } I'm applying # for, -	24
{C and, } sometimes the deejays are just kind of annoying and irritating	9
Right,	15
{F Oh, } no,	21
the money is actually coming out of your own pocket,	24
Then you hear so much, {D you know, } on the news about, {F uh, } child care places	24
{C and } -- -- I don't think this yard is a very, -	24
{F Uh, } from the time, -	26
{C But, } it's just, {F uh, } for those who [ have, + may have ] wanted to travel in that part of the world that are up in the age I am, it's going to eliminate that for awhile.	9
[ I, + I ]  remember when I was a kid, I used to do [ little, + little ] things for the old folks around the neighborhood,	24
Is that enough during the hotter times of the year?	7
{C But } I found that this worked really well.	24
{C and, } {F uh. } -	26
I think those are pretty exciting.	9
uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh,	15
they dwell on what they do have	24
No,	33
Yeah,	15
What they do is they work construction,	24
exactly.	36
I'm educated,	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
Finally what we did was we said, we're going to have to let the back yard die.	24
[ [ we, + we try to, ] + we're trying to ] take it on walks now, {D you know } --	24
I don't have an actual instruction book	24
{C So, } I don't think any of it comes back	9
Yeah,	36
{C And } nurses get so worn down.	9
If they would make it something where they, {D you know, } would pick it up at the curb or at least make it, {D you know, } down the street and at the corner, # type # of thing, {F uh, } -	24
# Bye-bye. # <noise>.	38
uh-huh. #	15
Right,	36
Yeah,	15
I could use a discount.	24
Yeah.	15
I think,   *[[slash error]] Uh-huh.	26
[ I, + I, ] -	26
[ Why do, +  {F uh, } is that just because they have ] such a low opinion of the public?  And  the public's, # {F uh } # , # gullibility # ?	7
{F Um } <<pause>>.  So do I <laughter>.	36
{D Well, } that's great, be-, -	21
<Laughter> {D So, } {F uh, } [ were, + were ] the, {F uh, } sentences that the judge handed out what you thought to be fair,	7
this is Laurie,	6
{C so. } -	26
Yeah.	36
I know,	24
Yes.	4
there's just no way for us to be involved over there and hope that there will be much peace.	9
Yeah.	15
{C But } it's not as bad here,	24
{C and } this is his first year,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{E I mean, } I'm sure when you make your appointment and go by, everybody puts on a happy face, {F um, }	9
<Throat_clearing>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
{F Um, } I'm done, where I work.	24
Will a shot be an ounce?	7
{C and, } {F uh, } I don't know why I never registered it	24
Yeah.	15
I was a solid weight trainer,	24
We have never done that before,	24
That's incredible.	21
Right,	36
and, uh, we'll probably do something like that,	24
<Laughter> Okay.	29
{C And } they send out [ this, +  this ] spike that has this purple ball on the top of it.	24
In Missouri,	11
They've got Research Triangle Park here,	24
<Laughter>.	20
then  there's the, {F uh, } Dolly Parton, {F uh, } Hollywood sound.	24
Yeah.	15
# Yeah. #	15
[ I don't, +  you don't ] sound  {D like } you're in this category,  but {E I mean } -- -- for extremely obese people or something?*[[needs slash unit - note punctuation]] The kind of people that can't sit in the  [ airline, +  airplane ] chair, # {D you know? # }	9
And so we wanted a smaller car,	24
I've seen some people that are  really quite up there <laughter> {D you know } -- -- they look like in their very late sixties	24
[ we, + I ] always worry about the barbecue in that you have to be, -	24
Uh-huh.	15
it's got, -	26
{C and } they're not.	24
and I, I feel like what I've learned working is a hundred times more valuable then what learned in school.	9
{C and, } {F uh, } everything's still inches.	24
{C and, } {D you know, }  whenever you're with your kids, you want to interact with them rather than just ignore  them.	9
{F Oh, } yeah.	4
{C but } wouldn't it be nice if no one had to fight anybody else.	7
In fact, I think it sort of raises nurturing  and being a mother to what it ought to be which is a respected profession.	9
Uh-huh.	15
<Laughter> {F Oh } no,	33
It is. -	36
That's sort of the same thing [ that, + that ] I do.	24
Yeah,	15
they talk about these different levels and stuff	24
{C but } that's the extent of what I've done.	24
{C And } the view that I would rather take <laughter> -- -- is that there's a different amount of information you need when you're particularly interested in a topic or, {F uh, } particularly interested in buying something [ as a, + # {D you know } # -- -- as a ] hobbyist versus when you want to go out and buy a blender because you need to mix things.	9
{F Um, } painting,	24
yeah.	15
{D Well, } what are your hobbies?	39
Uh-huh,	15
{C and } {D you know, }  as a teacher [ you're alert, + you're alert  ] for the kid who's very drowsy.	24
{C and, } our Irish came and, {D you know, } built the towns and, did labor.	24
believe me.	13
And they, they still live at home.	24
{F Oh }  I will	37
Yeah	15
[ I am wanting bl-, + I want blue ] and purple and,  {D you know, } just different shades of that. {C Because } [ my, +  my ] house is gray,	24
--  {C and } [ I just, + {D you know, } I just  ] refuse to give it to them.	24
{F Uh. }  Bye-bye.	38
Right,	15
{C So } they took it in and charged us the twenty-five dollars,	24
{C and } he loves that.	24
let's see, do you do it as a task	7
Right.	15
-- and I think that's in a way it's more, some, an area where some of the day care, uh, <noise> programs have left off <noise> --	9
-- {C and } there are parts of downtown  or near downtown Dallas that are under water right now, I guess,	24
{F Huh? }	14
{C So } I'm very much aware of, {F uh, } crime in the cities [ and the, + and the ] concern about it.	24
Okay.	29
{C And } what's their home situation.	24
# Where have you been? #	39
<Laughter>  Oh.	15
That's right. #	21
They don't feel secure there,	9
{C and } the kids are thrilled,	24
all I can think of is the name of ALL IN THE FAMILY	24
Right.	15
As a matter of fact I read in the sports page this morning,	24
My husband reads a lot of the, {F um, } <lipsmack> -	24
I have connections  [ but, + but ] not particularly deep ones to the Vietnamese war type situations,	24
Uh-huh.	15
You bet,	36
<Laughter> I, -	26
[ {C and then,  } + {C and then } ] people always get upset about it, too, because, {D you know, } every year [ [ the, + the, ] + the ] politicians are the ones that are usually pushing for more people to vote,	9
<Noise>.	20
{C And } we walked through the fence out,  the alleys, [ ar-, + ] come to the back of the house, {D you know. }	24
# Yeah.	36
There's a place on Greenville called  (( Sagar's )) .	24
I see.	15
Yeah.	15
{D Well } we don't want that either.	9
Yeah,	36
{E I mean } it's not so serious, I guess, until it affects your family	9
"I think [ [ [ if it were to be, + {F uh, } if it were to be, ] +  {F um, } if it were to be, ] + <whispering>  {A [ hold, + hold ]  on a second please, someone just walked in the ro-, } *[[seems to me that the ""hold on"" should be a separate slash unit (marked 'ad'), and shouldn't continue into B.15]] <Rattling>  [ If, + if ] it were to be ] spent in the  right way I think I wouldn't be so upset about it,    *[[see B.13 note]]"	13

{C and } [ I like different, + I like the ] anchors to be different kinds of people.	24

Jimi Hendrix was the original.	24
{C and } they just wanted me to continue working for them at home doing other things,	24

{D Well, } I would think he would <laughter>.	9
We lived in the Chicago area at the time,	24
{C But } {D like } last year, I think we paid, -	24
I don't like the new stuff.	24
[ {C And, } + {F uh, } <sigh> <clanging> {C but } ] I think that it can be helpful in that, {F uh, } it gets people the level of physical care they need.  {F Uh, }	9
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	15
It feels, -	26
{D You know, } {E I mean, } some of these guys are forty years old and got ten convictions.	24
{F Uh, } we, {F uh, } -	26
{D Well, } some people aren't.	21
{C And then, } {F uh, } who knows,	16
I, -	26
{D so, } {D you know. } -	26
{C and } there's a lot of boating out there,	24
it is frozen, isn't it?	7
-- keep it damp.	15
{C but, } -	26
yeah. #	15
{C And } [ I, + I ] really try to stretch  [ my, +  my ] dollars here and there, shopping, {F uh, } at warehouses sometimes, {D like } at Sam's and  things like that.	24
I think that's unbelievable.	9
Are you ready to start?	7
Do you like them?	7
{C and } we'd have to get really warm,	24
{C But, } we have all single families.	9
I never really took to  hunting.	24
{C and } they're just perfect.	24
{E I mean, } anyway   [ they can, + {D you know, } they can ] see to connect into something and hate it more,	9
<Laughter> Oh.	15
Yeah.	15
You have some -- -- solid ideas.	9
if I get off the tee box [ and  I, + and I've, ] {D you know, } {D you know, } anything from a hundred fifty to two hundred yard drive through a straight, I just want to get down and kiss the ground, {D you know } <laughter>.	24
{D Well }  I wondered if  I was  going to get to talk to a male or a female on this  (( type ))  <laughter>.	24

I'm going to U T D here in Dallas.	24
No.	33
I wonder [ with, + with  ] all our chemicals [ and, + and  ]  that [ and, + and  ] the foods we eat, -	24
I haven't even been keeping track.	24
For Christmas, my daughter and I received matching sweat shirts -- -- that a friend had made for us.   A beautiful Christmas design,	24
I love going out in the Summer in the grass.	24
Yeah.	36
yes.	15
over in Europe they don't have the kind of waste we do here.	9
{D well } that's why there's, {D you know, } people dealing it because there's money in it, {D you know. }	9
with education # you can't, # take that away from you.	9
# Uh-huh. #	15
{F Oh, } yeah.	21
<Throat_clearing>.	20
{C and } my mother and I have talked about it, [ to + ] how important it was when I came home from school.	24
{D you know, } [ the less {D actually, } + the less ]  you spend on a car it seems like luxury cars, -	9
{C but } [ [ i-, + it's, ] + it's ] at least something.	24
[ yo-, + you're ] kind of limited in what you can do there and  everything,	24
<Laughter> {F Oh, } no,	21
Sure,	38
{C So } if I just need something real quick,  [ and + ] I don't feel like getting up and going and getting what I printed,	24
{C so } you get a little [ antic-, +   {D you know, } anxious ] there and go {D well, } {D you know, } I don't feel that sure	9
Yeah.	15
They were just, {D you know, } small time cases where, {F uh, } trailers and banks were involved, {D you know. }	24
Everybody that has, has them later in life.	24
Yeah,	15
#I refused to work more than thirty.#	24
Uh-huh.	15
right.	15
[ I, + I  ] try to do as much as I can.	24
Yes.	15
{F Uh, } [ I couldn't, +  you couldn't ]  do it otherwise.	9
we [ live, + also live ]  in the city now, {D actually } in Manhattan.	24
{C so } we don't want him here.	25
Yeah.	15
{C and } I'll be honest with you,	24
{C But } I noticed when I was [ [ in the, + in the, ] + in Texas, ] they didn't have a state income tax,	24
{C and, } I know, in Minnesota, {F uh, } they had, {F uh, } the one that just, {F uh, }  got out and went after a, {F uh, } college student and raped, and killed her	24
Right.	15
I think it has something to do with the poverty level because Africa is certainly not a Catholic, {F uh, } country,	9
I think the title of it was just Downtown,	24
<Laughter>  {D Well, } we don't have any snow here now.	24
<Laughter>.	20
<Laughter>.   *[[slash error]] I know.    *[[slash error should be 'aa']]	20
{F Uh, } {C but } I really think it's important <inhaling> to put these children someplace where, in addition to, <inhaling> {D you know, } them getting an education, they really need [ a, + {D you know, } a ] socialization away from what they are raised in. Especially if you lived a pretty insular community	9
Yeah,	36
{C and -- -- then } she's got a lot of family there and that go and see her all of the time	24
when the war was on I watched C N N and, {F uh, } NIGHTLINE -- -- pretty regularly  and read the paper and all	24
Course it doesn't always work out in their favor.	24
{D So, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
do you think we're paying too much?	7
Sure.	15
{C So, } it's [ ber-, + basically ] mindless.	9
Yeah,	15
Yeah.	15
I had a friend whose brother  did steroids	24
{D well, }  I am a school teacher.	34
You have to be a very unselfish person [ to, + to ] spend a lot of time with your kids, I # think. #	9
Yeah,	36
[ New career. + New career  ]	24
I'm equally proud of her when I see her in church as I am when I see her performing.	24
{C and } Houston pulls [ for, + for ] the Rockets.	24
We've had a lot of wind around here.	24
{C But, } that's great.	21
At least their Daddy goes with them,	24
# {C Or } # they have family here    and this way they can go back and forth	24
No <laughter>.	15
Oh. Uh-huh.	15
I used to, {F uh, } get into it and get out of it based on my schedule,	24
{F Um, } I really haven't had, {F uh, } too many problems.	24
# <Laughter> {F Oh, } # that's right.	21
{C And } even if I knew how to teach the  subject matter, I don't know if I'd know how to handle that kind of [ a, + a ] group of kids.	9
No,	33
I'm talking sand in the ears and the eyes and the hair -	24
I think it's good that you see these, {D you know, } {D like } boxes, cereal,	24
{D Anyway, } do you have a pet?	7
I refused to cram their lives full.	24
I've never done any of those fancy kinds of paint treatments,	24
{C but } I think, {D you know, } [ mo-, + for the most  ] part, {D you know, } the teachers have been pretty good and I have got out of it [ what I have, + what I have  ] put into it.	24
{D Actually } I just joined, {F um, } the Appalachian Trail Walking Club, or whatever they call it,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and then, } {F uh, } I think, -	9
Okay.	15
Yeah.	15
{C But, }  {F uh, } there's, {F uh, } [ some, + some ] stuff that I want to do with {D like } Sierra Club and go down to Grand Canyon or  something like that.	24
I don't know about Hispanics, {D you know. } #	24
years ago, you thought, {D well, } these little small cities and all, <lipsmack> wouldn't have that problem,	9
Okay,	15
Yeah.	4
{C And } that's how you got involved.	8
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } that's, {D like, } {D you know, } five seconds for the whole play --	9
no.	36
{D So, } -	26
{C and } [ I really +  <laughter>  I ] cannot remember too much about it.	24
Yeah,	15
Right.	36
My son just turned two	24
{C And } I [ have, +  have ] [ done, +  {F uh, } gone ] to work for American Heart and just recently for the Leukemia Society.	24
Yeah,	4
{C but } I have never tried it.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Okay.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Unpredictable.	21
[ [  My, + my, ] + my ] field is the cognitive sciences	24
{C and } I guess maybe there are some parts of that,	9
{E I mean, } [ It was, + it was, ] {E I mean, } -	26
It comes out every Tuesday.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } it's, {F uh, } -	26
{E I mean, }   it's like, -	25
{C and } that's where we stopped.	24
# {C But } I like, -	24
{D Well, } sh-, -	26
-- [ I don't, +  I  ((   )) ]  my debts. -	26
{C And, } {F uh, } there was no exercise.	24
# <Laughter> <static> # Yes,	15
I'm a speech therapy major --	24
{E I mean } it's a big mortgage in the sky	24
that's,  -	26
they each have their own rooms,	25
# <Laughter>  {F Oh, } no.  #	21
I don't know if I believe that or not,	34
Uh-huh.	15
It would be a last resort.	24
# {F Oh, } okay. #	29
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well } you shouldn't do that.	18
And I know that, uh, you know, it can be freezing cold in the wintertime, and hot and, uh, sticky in the summertime.	24
Oh.	15
Right <breathing>.	15
I, {F uh, } spent four years as a university professor.	24
[ that, + it's ] good because it does make you think, about your own family.	9
{C and } the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence	24
# {F Oh, } yeah. #	4
it's here in Dallas.	24
{F Oh, } that was good.	21
{C and } my husband is trying to  get me into using a, {D you, know, } {D like } a high number wood -- -- instead.	24
{C But } [ my dad, + {F uh, } my dad ] used to grow tomatoes and things at the house.	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
it still echoes.	24
{C and } I know you -	26
Yes.	4
[ {C But, } +  {C and then } ] usually  after I'm done riding the bike, just to cool myself down, I usually take a walk,  {D you know, }	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
It's free	24
Uh-huh.	15
no.	33
{C but } [ they don't, + you don't, ] -	26
{C But } I would love, I wish [ [ an American, + an American,  ] + ] that, {D you know, } engineering would make something as solid as a German car.	24
{C but, }  {F uh, } the Russian economy -	9
{D Well } let me ask you this then.	18
Yeah,	36
{C and } the fact that when they have sanctions and we support things like this, it means something.	9
Wh-, -	26
[ [ {C But, } +  {F uh, }  {C and } ] +  -- -- {C and } ] I guess I still have a soft spot.	24
{D well, } not everything	9
[ You j-, + they just ] don't,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I know they changed afterwards.	24
{C and } they're going to recycle them.	24
{C So, } I thought it was really, {D you know, } kind of a pretty good deal not to have to pay tax on your groceries	24
{C And } she said what about the people  that are walking around,	24
Yeah	36
he liked that.	24
Yeah.	15
I've lived in, <noise> {F uh, } Denver	24
He's doing, {F uh, } quite a bit of consulting work and, # has been # offered a permanent position	24
There's very few places [ that you, + I'll bet that you  ] could, {F uh, } -	9
{C And } down there at Sabine Pass, {F uh, } I can't think  of the guy's name	24
In Los Angeles they're apparently going to, -	24
Of course, with  that goes along with the stock price of T I.	24
# Right,	36
{C and, So, } [ [ I, + I'm, ] + I ] couldn't live my  life without a P C.	24
I'm [ a ful-, + what they call a full ]  timer	24
{C And, } -	26
There's just not time <laughter>.	24
<Laughter>.	20
I've seen it in magazines and stuff where you dress your animals up and take them to a par-, -	24
{F Ooh, } yes.	15
[ {C or, } + {C or } ] should I say seven.	24
Uh-huh.	15
yeah.	15
I haven't either, {F uh, }	24
We have to take it to a recycling place.	24
{F Uh, } wow,  ((   )) .	21
{C so, } [ [ it, + it ] just, + ]  I sit and  learn new programs	24
{C and, } like I said, if they was willing to work, {F uh, } in the summers and  also maybe then the parents could pay a third	9
Actually [ they, + there ] was two other graduating seniors besides myself,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah <<Voice faded>>.	15
<Throat_clearing>.	20
# I'm not sure # -- -- where we went from there, #	24
That is their very favorite.	24
{C but, } {F uh, } -	26
{C So, }  I think it, -	26
{F Oh, } {C and } that can make a difference, too.	9
yeah.	15
{D So } that's what, -	26
Yeah.	15
sure,	36
if anything, I think, there's going to be fewer and  fewer, {F uh, } single income families.	9
But, um, private school you couldn't do that,	9
-- {C and } it seems to me they could  have been a lot more creative stuff used.	9
{D You know, } what for him to finish me off <laughter>. -	24
I  guess because we don't know,	9
{C but } I don't think the teachers could stand the stress <laughter> [ all, + all ] year long -- -- frankly.	9
{C and } [ there's, + {F uh, } there's ]  a lot of people here in Baltimore that, {F uh, } have -	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
{C But, } {D you know, } that's just my personal opinion,	24
I wouldn't call it invading my privacy by any means.	24
Although, {D you know, } stiffer sentences and lessening the effects of parole, -	9
but we have our share of cold weather as well.	24
{C and } of course then they had to go back to dec-, {D you know, } -	24
[ {C And, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } I know when we went to London, it was really funny.	24
Have you ever been to, {F uh, } {D like } New Mexico?	7
{C So, } if at a particular time, you wanted to get the latest and greatest news -- -- you could do that by, {F uh, } turning on C N N	24
Yeah,	15
Yeah.	36
{F Oh, } {F oh, } I see,	15
Yeah,	15
<laughter>.  Yeah,	15
{C And, } {F uh. } -	26
Yeah.	15
{C So, }  it got to the point where [ he's, + he's ] supposed to get out of, {F uh, } kindergarten {D like } about two thirty.	24
{D well } I've enjoyed talking to you.	38
I was worried --	24
{C And } [ I'm also, + I'm ] expecting,	24
we almost bought one of those.	24
and they do take up a lot of your time.	9
Uh-huh.	15
that's the only concern I would have,  because I think personalities plus the type of doctor it is has a lot to do  with the care,	24
{C and } in fact it used to be at Lake Brownwood,	24
{C and } as we can see. -	26
Oh!	21
{C But } because I know that's not going to happen, then I have to probably right up there about an eight <laughter>.	24
{C but } I think that we have a government and we have a lot of freedoms,  and we have a lot of things that the governments do with our money.	9
((   )) .	13
[ [ {C But, } + {C so, } ] + {D you know, } {C and then, } ] {D you know, } {D like } a five percent surtax, I'm paying forty percent tax.	24
"He said, ""My kids are my cattle."" {D You know. }  {C But } [ that, + that ] is the way most people feel, that women should get custody."	24
This is hilarious <laughter>.	9
<Laughter>.	20
{C but, }  {F uh, } -	26
Only work initially.	22
Uh-huh.	15
{C But } they like that with [ the, + the ]  cool ranch dressing that goes along with that.	24
me, too.	24
Uh-huh.	38
thirty years ago [ I, +  I ]  had a college job, {F uh, } working as a programmer	24
I don't know if was alcohol or something else that they were on	24
{D Anyway, } my home  [ is, + {F um, } I guess it's  ] about twenty-five hundred square foot	24
They really are.	9
<<Very faint>>  All right.	29
[ [ It, + it's,  ] + it's  ] real amateur sports.	9
It's just so sad, {D you know, }	9
{F Um, } I haven't done much Lotus work connected with my job.	24
My T V viewing started sort of mid-sixties,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I, -	26
{C and } it's really great because sometimes [ it's + {D like } the hologram makes up ] all these things	24
{C but } # -- -- {D you know, } they get lesser sentences	9
Yeah,	4
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah.	15
{C So, }  I, <laughter> -	26
there was, {F uh, } several other companies,	24
{C but } [  there's, +  {D you know, } there's ] a lot to see here --	24
Usually it doesn't divide words.	5
Yeah,	36
Okay,	13
Yeah.	15
that's it, {D you know. }	24
I think I would agree with you on that, too.	9
{C And } we're all going to have to do it.	9
[ I, + I ] guess there's a lot  [ to, + to ] think about when you're trying to make that decision.	9
{C And } it snowed all day.	24
[ I, + I ] trained him on my own	24
{C and } it usually goes through me twice a year	24
{D Well, } they've been trying different things.	24
Yeah,	4
Yes	15
What we're in the process of doing right now is paying off our credit cards entirely.	24
I'll spend a lot of time praying over it before I give it up.	24
{C and } I might look through it real quick if there's something that catches my interest, {F uh, } in regards to what's going on around the county or little bit of the state <dishes>.	24
{F Oh, } really?	12
{C and, } Yeah.	24
I guess that's not an easy solution.	9
Uh-huh.	15
yeah.	15
# Okay. #	38
{F Uh, } {D well, } {C and } if it was there, you would really have a little more, {F uh, } knowledge on what's going on -- -- probably, {D you know, } with your child.	9
Yeah.	15
that's good.	21
I like doing things with my hands.	24
{D Well, } I don't blame you for that.	21
Is that, -	7
no-, -	26
Take a twenty-two	24
{C So } what are some good things in Texas to go visit?	39
Uh-huh.	15
{C And then } in the summertime you could  put him out	24
Now we have friends with a van,	24
{C and } she did not realize until she got to be a senior and was doing her student teaching that she did not like it.	24
{C and so } <sigh> I decided to bake about four pies ahead, {D you know, } and freeze them,	24
Uh-huh.	30
I don't know if your on city water,	8
Seattle is only about two and a half hours,	24
I have three.	11
{C And } it's, -	26
{D Well, } do you think that people subscribe to magazines as much as they used to?	7
[ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C so } ] [ I, + I ] shopped around,	24
I think so too.	9
{C and } I guess it doesn't have [ any, + any  ] automatic features to it.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } I started out in Lubbock.	24
[ It's, + it's ] certainly not a real  upscale neighborhood,	24
I'm not <laughter>.	24
{F Uh, } I planted four hills of them.	24
Yeah.	15
Right.	15
{C So } I feel like {D you know, } [ that's is, + there is ] occasions  where [ there are, +  they do ]  spare lives	9
{C and } I have a couple of students who have graduated and gone to work for them.	24
What's your major?	39
{E I mean, } I'm constantly reading.	24
{F Uh, } {C so }  I, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
Yes.	36
{C And } I was watching on TV	24
She's a renovator, a lover of old things --	24
Right,	11
{F Oh, } I generally go to the quickie places just because they're cheap.	24
{D Well, } {E I mean, } {E I mean } I don't really know  [ what they can, + how they can ] really enforce the laws any better --	24
# Uh-huh.	15
{C but, }  {F uh, }  {D no, }  [ [ I, +  I ] have, + {F uh, } I had ]  a boat last summer that I took out,  a catamaran that I [ do, + did ] a lot of sailing on and stuff.	24
Yeah.	15
perhaps that would be a solution if they were required to vote at least for their first three or four years after they become of voting age. # Required to register # and vote for four years,	9
you kill him, {D you know, }	24
{D Well, } {D well, } the difficulty I have, is that, {F uh, } are we our neighbor's keepers.	24
-- {C and, } {F uh. } -	26
{F Um. }	26
{C and }  he keeps saying, {F oh, } no.	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	4
# <Noise> <TV> <laughter>. #	20
Uh-huh.	15
everybody I speak to is in Texas, {F oh, } {F oh, }	24
{F Oh, } my gosh.	21
{D well, } for instance, yes, {F um, }	4
Exactly.	36
Uh-huh.	15
-- it's wonderful, {F uh, }	24
{C So } that will be an interesting turn on vacations for our family.	24
-- {C and } it still would have  been every bit as accessible a movie for the kids if they had included all this stuff that,  I, {D anyway } as an intellectual adult would appreciate,	24
{C And } a lot of people said, {D well, } you should have turned pro.	24
Right.	15
{F Uh, } I think something will have to be done down there very soon  [ about, + {F uh, } about  ] Mexico [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } some of the other areas,	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C so } I don't do a lot of regular maintenance,	24
sure.	15
{C but, } the, {F um, } -	26
she needed to work	24
I'm in Texas too,	24
{C an }  I was at a point where it was like,  I didn't date, [ e-, + ]	24
[  We, + we ] buy from intimate international banking.	9
[ I, + I ] even like Guns and Roses, some of their stuff.	24
What about yourself?	31
They don't have children yet,	24
it's been awhile since I've looked at, -	24
The Rocky Mountains are so much, {F uh, } bigger than anything that [ they've -- + -- they've  ] got down here that, -	9
[ {C but } + {C and } ] they, -	26
))  {C but } [ it's, + {F uh, } it's ] on -	26
That's where I need to go <laughter>.	22
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
That [ was, + had ] a great conversation,	24
The military, -	24
I know.	24
exactly <talking>.	36
-- the really, -	26
# I was going # to say <laughter>.	36
I see.	15
I, -	26
I would like to see them go through either,	24
it's high too.	24
{C and } also, too, I think [ I'm, + I'm ] tempering this and the fact that the consequences are much more, {F uh, } serious in a criminal case.	9
Um?	14
the safety is, {F uh,} -	26
# Yes. #	36
{C and so } you just put the empty ones back out there	24
I, {F uh, } -	26
{C but, }  {F uh, } it  (( just, )) -	26
{C but } it's going to be a lot of work,	24
[ [ I, + I, ] + I ] do not think I would change it.	9
Right.	15
Even when you tell them no, they keep calling back.	24
Yeah.	15
{C but } {D yeah, }  next time you go, {F uh, } {D you know, } check into it,	18
-- {C and } it will be at this time of the year	24
good for you.	21
lot of the equipment,  too, that [ I've, +  I've ] used in the past, {F uh, } [ I w-, +  {D you know, } I've ]  used in school	24
I suspect that, {D you know, } thinking about it and looking at my friends and the number of credit cards that they use and, {D you know, } the amount that I know they buy, I guess probably a lot of them are in a similar situation, and, {D you know, } just don't talk about it.	24
{C So } I'm kind of, {F uh, } biased in that	24
[ I d-, + I never did  ] put things up when my kids were little	24
-- {C so } I like reading those to her	24
{C so. } -	26
yeah,	26
# Uh-huh. #	15
they are.	24
{E I mean, } he's been through it <laughter>.	9
{C but } it's not  too bad,	24
Oh.	15
No <squeak>.	33
I understand that because I'm from West Virginia,	24
uh-huh.	15
<Laughter> Basically about the same as what you've probably had.	24
Okay <TV>.	13
Right.	15
{C And, } -	26
That as far as -	26
{E I mean } he's playing a military part.	24
yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } they're showing {F uh, } LIVE AND LET DIE at this moment,	24
{C And  then, } I guess you've been through a couple  of summers here, too, right?	7
{C But, } {F uh, } {D you know, } [ we usually will, +  we ] used to rent, {F uh, } two or three movies on a weekend [ and, + and ] try to watch.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Sounds good.	9
That's one thing about cats though,	9
{C and } I like it just for the noise <laughter>.	24
{C And, }  I was like, I live in a nice neighborhood,	24
# Uh-huh.	15
It, certainly would	36
{C And } he'll say, {D you know, } {D hey, }  that guy did it, {D you know, } not me.	24
"{C and } you say, ""Never more."""	9
Uh-huh.	15
Does your club have a good woman's association?	7
{C so, } I don't know,	19
You're not supposed to have, {D like } the coupons in there.	24
And perhaps multiple people in multiple S and Ls	9
yeah,	4
{C and } I pick them when they're very young  and  have very little string and then just steam them a little bit,	24
-- {C and, } {F uh, } you hopefully find  [ that + ] you want the candidates that are running to be honest and aboveboard.	9
{C And } it had all the air pump  and, {F uh, } {F uh, } {A I don't know, } [ all that, + all that ] stuff.	24
we have, {F uh, } -	26
{C But, } yet, you need to keep up an appearance for your husband, too, though -- -- at home. Because that's, [ I, + I ] believe, -	9
Really.	36
Yeah,	15
With kids they don't care, {D you know, } {F uh, } [ a l-, + ] about a lot of things.	9
[ he is, +  he was ]  a really interesting animal.	24
{F Uh, } yeah.	15
I guess I wasn't involved enough [ to, + to, ] {F uh, } really stop to think about it.	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
<Laughter>.	20
[ It-, + it's ] not my favorite	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ Y-, + yeah, ]	4
{C and } her, -	26
# {F Oh, } I see,	15
{C and, }  {F uh, } they haven't had a reunion since then.	24
[ {C And }  he gets the, + {C and }  you get the  ] bill and send it to him?	7
<Baby>.	20
{C and } she would help us	24
my mother was an only child	24
{F Um } <laughter>,	26
{E I mean, }	26
{F Uh, }  (( as far as, )) -	26
[ Are th-, +  are there ] any other  specific things [ [ that, + that ] you feel like, +  [ where, + where ]  you feel ] your privacy to be invaded on a day-to-day basis or either on a growing frequency?	7
Yeah,	15
[ {C and } then <laughter>, + # {C and, } ] # {F um, } I'm trying to think what else I like to watch on television sports wise.	24
{C and } -- -	26
{C so } I'm always asking [ where, + where ]  in the state, {D you know, } the person is from if they're in Texas.	24
-- {C or } I could  do, {F uh, } work four days a week at  ten hours a day and have a, {D you know, } three [ w-, + ] day weekend. And [ make, + {F uh, } make ] my job flexible in that case.	24
{C And } [ I, + I ] guess [ all, + most ] of the shows I like are, are kind of along the same line because they're all adventure  <laughter>.	24
{C and, } it feels good	9
Even if there are small children around, [ there's, + {D you know, } you can't ] say people with small children can't have guns <talking> --	9
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
It was someone that, {F uh, }  [ show-, + {D you know, } just kind of showed ] up at the field.	24
# I think, {F uh, } I find myself getting my little projects going and not taking the time that I should <laughter>.	24
I think so too.	36
It's not {D like } something that they really wanted.	9
{C And then } after they had to start paying to move us, that suddenly wasn't necessary any more <laughter>.	24
{C and } that's due to the Corps of Engineers [ building, + looking years ahead and building ] all these # reservoirs for us, {D you know. } #	24
it could still happen then.	9
<Lipsmack> [ {C But, } + {E I mean, } {C and  } ] no one [ will, + will ] go a step further to remove the english signs.	9
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] the people that are talking this numbers have no concept of what that number means.	9
No,	33
Uh, we just bought, uh, acre, a house with an acre to try to, so she'll have some room to walk around, and not off of a busy street.	24
<breathing> <breathing>	20
Before I even got married I had my cat.	24
they're not nearly as selective as they used to be.	24
{C and, } {F uh, } that's the type of goal I think most people ought to look for,	9
Yeah.	15
in fact, I have been real disappointed in the six years that I've lived out here about lot sizes <breathing> <laughter>.	24
{C and } I push them on swing.	24
She's only been around one [ and, + and ] sometimes two people at the most	24
live on an island [ off, + off ] shore from Seattle.	24
{D Well, } I've enjoyed talking to you.	38
{F Uh. }	26
{D Well, } [ that was, + I bet that was ] a lot of fun.	8
I'm very lucky though, again too, my boss is very akin to family building.	24
<Clicking> <talking> <breathing> {F Uh, } <lipsmack> let's see.	17
{C But } when you get, {F uh, } -	26
no,	33
-- {C but, } [ [ I, +  {F uh, } I'm   truly enough, ] +  {D you know, } I'm truly ] an intellectual snob, to be going to these kinds of movies,	24
It's clearly just [ a, + a ] design problem there.	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } -- -- we took another friend with us	24
They still show MISTER ROGERS.	24
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] there is a [ lot of pressure, + lot of thrust ] to get that much weight up in the air.	24
Tell Daddy I unplugged it for you.	10
I said that,   I could believe in it in certain instances,  but [ I would be, +  I'd find ] it hard to levy that against somebody.	24
Uh-huh.	15
why, {D you know, } everyone that lives in  town and has yards practically has [ land-, + ] {F uh, } <lipsmack> watering system.	24
{C So } it's just a different world.	9
Right.	15
{C And, }  {F um, } {D actually } I've tried that with a few companies lately.	24
{C and } of course, {D you know, } [ they're, + they're ]  playing it up real big that  it [ was, + ] looked like it was a very, very small ring	24
{C So, } {F uh, }  <lipsmack>  {D anyway, } it was nice talking to you Dudley.	38
{C but } -- -- I know [ they use that, + {E I mean } they # sell those, # ] -	9
{C and } -- -- I don't foresee them, {F uh, } building a new one for a  long time because  they can't afford it.	24
Really.	15
{D See, } {D well, } [ you, + I ] don't do it either <laughter>.	24
and then the summer gets up to eighties, nineties	24
I agree with that.	36
it is, especially with [ the, +  being in on the ] creative  [ a-, + aspect ] and the crafty end.	9
When I have heard about England's elections, they are allowed to run for what, a total of six or eight weeks. Even for the higher offices [ in the, + in the ] land.	24
{C and } [ they have, + [ [ this, + this, ] + this ] woman owns  ] three day cares, two in Lewisville and one in Irving.	24
{C But } I can't say  I use them very often <throat_clearing>.	24
{D You know, } {C and so, } {F um, } the thing  [ is, + is ]  that <throat_clearing>  once you've done something wrong, which is [ natio-, + # {D you # know, } internationally ]  recognized, then you're going to try to get out of it	9
Really I just got mine in the mail	24
{E excuse me, } go ahead.	18
{F uh, } [ [ they're, +  they're, + ] + they're ] polite,	9
{F Uh, } {C so, } [ we're, + [ we, + we ] ] [ have to, + have to ] deal [ with, + with  ] the, {F uh, } situation [ as, + as ] we played it.	9
<Laughter>.	20
<Laughter>  # {F Oh, } shoot. #	21
# {C And, } # obviously, that has something to do with it.	9
just  the events that happen around the world interest me. Stay in touch with it  and [ know, + feel like I know ]  what's going on.	24
[ I, + I ] went to college and then started working and then got married	24
[ I, + I ] think I'm kind of bent towards middle  liberal of the bridge myself.	24
Yes.	15
{C and } the river [ was, + it was ] up about three feet	24
Good luck.	38
I'm fascinated by that.	24
Yeah.	15
{C and, }  {F uh, }  {D well, } I grew up in South Dakota.	24
Right.	36
Uh-huh.	15
yeah.	15
I don't have room for this.	24
{C So, } we both like to go to dive resorts.	24
#  [ we, + # we ] took a lot of vacations while we were there because everything was within driving distance.	24
Yeah,	36
{C and, }  {F uh, } [ it, +  my price ] right now, for what I pay, -	26
a lot of women do.  {F Um, }	24
Uh-huh.	15
It was ninety-six yesterday,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Well, I guess, it has to do with a lot of the stuff that I find out I am paying for now. {D You know? }	24
{F Uh, } we have a Sheltie Collie, a miniature Sheltie.	24
<<Very faint>> Uh-huh.	15
You know what I'm saying?	8
the people that I've known like  from Germany and Finland that have done that -- -- [ are, + they do ]  military service which, {D you know, } I don't exactly recommend <noise>,	24
nowhere near that expensive.	21
{F Uh, } we <talking> bought it at an, unfinished, {F uh, } furniture place -- -- and sanded it down and, {F uh, } stained it and then lacquered over it <Talking>.	24
{C and } somebody's got to be willing to pay for it, and believe in it,	24
{C and then } some of these big, these rich people started to, -	9
Uh-huh.	15
Hi, Judy.	6
We still have bins at the grocery stores  where you can turn in bottles and  cans, for cash.	24
I get free money for thirty days.	24
{C And } [ it's, + it's ] very hard, because when you get used to two salaries, it's very hard [ to, + to ] cut back to one.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C So } [ that's, + that's ]  what I'm pursuing right now --	24
They don't either,	9
they took the car, [ they, + I knew they ] were going to pull it from Town North because that's where the white one was.	24
#  ((   ))  # twenty, -	26
it's not the evaporator, the big filter on one side.	24
{C And } when everybody turned we all  four of us <laughter> turned in a row <laughter>.	24
{D So, }  it's nice to talk with you	6
{C And } the same with  the airlines back in the days when they were, {F uh, } controlled [ and, +  and, ]  {F uh, } Transcontinental or,  {F um, } {F um, } Interstate, {F uh, } Trucking.	9
well no,	25
Sure.	15
{C So } you usually end up paying close to eighty dollars a week	24
{C but, } I lived on the outskirts too,	24
Right,	36
{C Because } once you're in there, then you can easily expand.	9
All right.	15
I'm not sure I have.	34
Our, -	26
And then, of course, there was, there was the, uh, in Columbia, with the drug lords.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C So } there are a lot of things.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
It was about, {F uh, } -	26
{D You know, } it's good to have, {F um, } -	9
How about yours?	31
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
Right.	36
{C so } I can [ live without, + live without ] dessert for the most part.	24
it's like for drug dealers is the new big thing {D like } in, -	24
most of the guys were all in one class	24
I had ordered a sofa and had filled out the paperwork,	24
Yeah	26
That'd be the best way to be.	9
{C And, }  {F uh, } that really, started a lot of stuff off,	24
-- {C so } [ we had to, + we had to ] give him a [ tomato, + tomato ] juice bath, and, {F uh, } get him cleaned up,	24
# They are # [ mostly, + {F uh, } mostly ] Mozart.	24
Yeah,	15
{C and } the C I A is [ a, + a ] very large, very high profile agency and to have it located out in West Virginia, -	9
Uh-huh.	15
I know we have a lot of chemical, the indoor type pollution.	24
There's, {D you know, } some of the  really totally country stuff, I don't really particularly like	24
{C and, } {F um, } you can call it a home because it's a place to go  home and keep the rain off your head,	24
Were you there at a? -	7
I don't know.	19
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } okay.	29
{C and } it's not, {F uh, } {D you know, } -	9
{C But, } {F um, } we kind of thought  that maybe they just wanted to give him some medication to sort of, {D you know } -- -- keep him real out of it all the time --	24
We had a printer,  a Hewlett Packard Ready Writer.	24
<laughter>.	20
<Throat_clearing>  {F Oh, } [ they're, + they're ]  little ones # <laughter>. #	24
{C because } they said that We don't have that type of trashy politics up here like they do in Texas all the time.	24
I go to a state sponsored school	24
I told him to look to yourself.	24
do, -	26
They are tough	22
[ It, +  no, it ] really was extremely warm.	24
course, it's a standing joke, {D you know, } [ when the, + when the ] men come [ in + in ] [ a, + a ] tie and a suit coat, you say, {D you know, } what, have you got a job interview today	24
{C Because, } {F um, } <noise> {F oh, }  about the time I got out of working that long hours was [ when the, + {F uh, } <noise> when the ]  twins were about three years old.	24
<Noise>.	20
I had to  do, that, {F uh, } the same, {F uh, } for about every quarter of the year.	24
[ My daughter, + my daughter ] lives down in Rowlett	24
It seems like it's absurd the number of people who end up having to pay somebody to do it.	9
Yeah,	36
{D Well, } it's a social -- -- disease that we have called one upsmanship, {D you know. }	9
they're  in the playoffs, right?	7
{D well } it was nice talking with you.	38
What do you like to read?	31
I don't know how close you are to getting a house or anything,	24
we bought it real reasonably	24
I think we had fish [ sh-, + ] when I was a kid	24
I just, {F uh, } moved down from South Dakota in July,	24
I just couldn't hack it.	24
I had plenty of snow to last me forever.	24
Yeah,	15
{C So } it's really up north in the country, really, #  ((   )) . #	22
Uh-huh.	15
Right.	36
{F Oh, } sure.	15
Yeah. #	15
{C so } [ that's, + that's  ] what matters.	24
once you  find the doctor that you like it's not a problem.	9
Right.	15
{C but } you look at [ our, + our ] crime rates and things like that and you compare them [ to, + to ] {D like } Texas or someplace that does, {D you know, } [ [ it, + it, ] + it's ] impossible to make a case that [ it's, + it's ] affecting it in any way.	9
{F Oh, } boy.	21
Cambodia. <Throat_clearing> And to Laos,	24
Yes.	36
it takes me about fifteen minutes to do this now because  I do it all the time,	24
[ {C and, } + {C and } ]  we really don't have any that don't have the Social Security	9
{F Um, } you just never know when you might come into contact with one.	24
We talked about this for a few minutes,	24
Oh.	15
{F Oh, } {D well, } that's nice.	21
It seems like, it depends on [ what, + what ] group you happen to be in, [ what, + what ] you're going to get and what you're not going to get	9
Yeah,	15
Yes,	4
{C and } I'll go nothing,	24
{F Oh, } they love to dig.	24
{F Uh, } this is [ a, + a ]  question that hit pretty close to home.	24
{C And } [ it, + it ] depends on what it is, {D you know. }	24
# {C And } they're # going to be really struggling	9
{C So } that's a big concern if you live there, # is to really lock your car up # .	8
I just, {D like, } what, -	24
{F Oh, } no,	33
it is nice.   *[[slash error]] Right, right <laughter>.   *[[aa; slash error]] {D Well } that's right.   *[[aa]]	24
{D well, } {D you know, } {D like } some, [ w-, + ] [ symptoms, + medical symptoms, ] {D like } [ when, + how do you know when ] to take your child to the doctor or not, # type # books, which I use as reference and have been real handy.	24
[ it's, + it's ] seen some wear and tear. {D You know. }	24
I could have gone Monday.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } although I did go down and  register and I, -	24
That is right <laughter>.	36
{C and, }  {F uh, } that's how you come up with aspirin that costs four dollars apiece and things like that. The horror stories that you hear about people going into the hospital for a week and, {F uh, } it being, a four thousand dollar bill.	9
my son is certainly not persuaded of that <<pause>>.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } yeah,	4
that's -- -- right.	21
{C Because } there're many Italians in Argentina.	24
No.	33
{C and } they are not so stringent [ and, + ] {D you know } to make us feel uncomfortable.	9
{C And, }  {F uh, } we like Indian food, and Thai cuisine and, {F uh, } sort of gourmet Mexican and, {F uh, } things like that, as well as Tex-Mex and Italian and, {F uh, } Chinese and things, [ and, + and ] things of that sort.	24
{D Well, } {F uh, } {F uh, }  most of my friends do spend a lot of time down in Florida.	24
Yeah,	4
-- {C but } -- -- that's not the case,	24
Uh-huh.	15
# {F Uh, } # being basically an engineer and liking, {F uh, } doing installation work, {D well } there's not any.	24
[ My, +  my ] little boy has gotten so  into it that	24
that's, -	26
yeah. #	15
{D Well, } [ I, + {D like, } I ] am undisciplined in the sense that I can't just go and do exercise,	24
Homes,	30
The, {F uh, } -	26
how do you feel that is for someone [ at, +  at ] that phase in their life?	39
Sherman and Denison,	24
Unfortunately,	36
I thought it  was [ to, + ] going to Oak Cliff over the Trinity.	24
[ [ I think, + I think I blame it, ] + I think I blame it ] on a couple of different things.	9
I don't know how many people could live up in space, {F uh, } for any length of time <laughter>.	24
{F Uh, } you, -	26
{C or } did you pull them, up by the roots,	35
{F Oh, } okay.	29
{C so } we've had a lot of  stuff,   {D you know, } friends [ and, +   and ] things  to do with music that constant, -	24
{C And } that was on T V.	24
Uh-huh.	15
No, # {F uh, } #	33
okay.	26
<Child_talking> {D Well, } {D see } that is like I said. [ I {D like, } + I ] do not watch much T V any more either.	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ I  buy, + I try to buy ] as simple a car as possible.	24
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } up until, {F oh, } say two weeks ago, it had never had anything <laughter> wrong with it.	24
Yeah <<very faint>>.	15
Right.	15
Yeah.	26
{C But } I look, for example, -	26
{D So } you went to what college?	14
{C And } I, -	26
[  It was, + it was ] super,	24
# {F Oh, } you're kidding. #	21
I admire people that have that in their minds already.	24
{F Uh } <breathing>, it is to a certain extent --	11
Um-hum	15
{C and } we have a little Halloween talent show tonight,	24
{C and } it amounted to, {F uh, } going in, {F uh, } before any of these interviews,	24
{F Um, } you just, -	26
Yeah,	36
{C or } maybe this is just my own personal. -	24
They were civil.	24
<Laughter>.	20
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
Oh, yeah.	36
I guess I would now use [ the, + the ] new mayonnaise free.	8
-- {C because } they go from hardback to paperback	24
{C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } [ there's, + {D well } that's ] get to be a problem in Texas, {D you know, } because different school systems have got more or less money to take care of that sort of thing,	24
[ I, +  {F uh, } I, ] -	26
{C And } [ there's, + there's ] [ a + ] little recycling trucks and things throughout the city	24
[ I, + we ] try to do a lot of things as a  family and, {D you know, } inexpensively as possible,	24
we were at a  soccer game Saturday,	24
{F Oh, } dear.	21
What do you serve with it?	39
{C but } it didn't get the upper part of my body,	24
[ the, + like I said, the ] more I hear about it, the more I can see each decision that was made as being understandable.	24
{C and } [ I was so, + I was so ] thrilled because they came up, {E I mean } nice green shoots coming up all over the place.	24
And so i-, i-, it's, I think, i-, to me I think, uh, something that's going to help our medical, uh, arena is for, um, -	9
Uh-huh.	15
# Yeah,	15
Okay,	15
{C and } I'm going to make it a point to.	37
more than it's worth.	9
I think that people  who, {F uh, } infringe on other people's rights, {F uh, } and screw up their whole lives  with rape, {F uh, } child molesting, {F uh, } terrorism, just # {F uh, } # -	9
{C and } [ it w-, + it was, ] -	24
Uh-huh.	15
<Breathing> Gosh.	21
{C and } [ it, + it ] does its job.	9
A group party.	22
{C So } I think that, {F uh, } they need to look into it	9
Right.	15
they have got the quarterback there in Randal Cunningham, who's just, {D you know, } phenomenal,	24
{F Oh, } how nice,	21
yeah.	36
{F uh, } she is really looking  forward.	24
{D Well, } to tell you the truth,  I've been going to college for the last four years	24
{F Uh, } {C and, } -	26
{D Well, } what are you studying?	39
Do you get any sort of discount  when you use a card like  that?	7
{F Oh, } {C so } you pressed one?	7
yeah.	15
{D you know, } it's at home, [ I can, + I can ] do some of my reading,	24
{C but } I don't know that it would be state approved.	24
it's big.	24
{C And } I said my goodness,	24
{C but, } {F uh, } they really were helpful, I know, to our house.	24
yeah.	15
Right.	15
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] really feel [ [ that, + that, ] + that ] is part of the problem that [ we, + we've ] let things get so out of control [ that, + that ] we don't want to put the brakes on them.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
I'm in Dallas.	24
{F Um, } {C but } benefits, -	26
I, -	26
I mean, <laughter> #is it (( )),#  -	26
it's relaxing.	9
{D So, } {F uh, } {D well } how long have you been married?	39
[ I have, +  in school I have ]	24
Uh-huh.	15
<Breathing>  No.	33
{C but } they're good sugar.	24
# {C So, } # I have to be. -	24
Yeah,	15
Huh-uh.	15
-- {C but, } <inhaling> {D well, } it was interesting talking to you.	9
# Pinks and greens. #	30
I think it's a hundred years.	24
-- {C and } it's one that we use in our work.	24
Yeah.	26
[ I, + I  ] presume,	9
{C or, } -	26
They, -	26
just news,	36
is it on nineteen hundred?	38
Yeah.	36
I know I'm an epileptic	24
{C And } I think it wouldn't hurt them to step back from themselves just slightly and see things from a [ m-, +  far more ] disadvantaged viewpoint.	9
{C and } the [ lube, + lubrication ] system needs to be lubricated and <inhaling> -	24
Okay.	13
No,	33
They live down in College Station where, his parents do too.	24
[ You don't, + {F uh, } you're not ] [ in-, + into ] hacking or whatever <laughter>.	8
{C and then } we did all this for him <laughter>.	24
[ I, + I ] hate to cut it off,	24
{C and } you literally step up on the step and move your arms,	24
I guess,	9
<Laughter>.	20
<Laughter>.	20
It really is.	9
{D You know, } the Schnauzers are a little aggressive.	9
{D well } that's good to know.	21
He loves it.	24
My goodness.	21
{D You know, } [ [ I've, +  I've  s-, ] +  I, ] -	26
{F Um, } no,	33
-- it's something that I [ hadn't, +   hadn't ] done before.	24
I guess that for me it was very helpful.	24
{C So } no big deal.	9
<Laughter>.	20
I just would not believe him any more.	24
Sure,	36
{F Um, } I like [ the idea of nursing homes [ as a, + as a ] growing choi-, + the choices you have in nursing homes ] now, whereas [ [ used to, + you used to ] have only, + you put, ] {D you know, } -	9
{D You know, } {E I mean, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I've ] never liked credit cards -- -- and a lot of debt, {D you know, }	24
Exercise is not supposed to do that to you.	9
No,	33
{C and } it's really hard.	24
[ {C and } that's, + {C and } that's ]  one thing is once [ you, + {D you know, } you ] get into a house it's like, you get more stuff,	9
Do you have any particular thoughts about the school system?	31
{C And, } {F uh, } there's less, {F uh, } friction involved in relationships when you add that skill -- -- of teamwork.	9
That's the only one that I, {D you know, } -	24
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	4
the  (( cattiness ))  behind, -	26
{C and, } -	26
((   ))  all twelve, -	24
I can't imagine plants, -	24
{F Uh, } # yeah. #	4
Uh-huh.	15
We've # got, # some children who would just really, {F uh, } enjoy  having an animal, {D you know, } a dog, I think	24
Yeah.	15
I'm a C P A	24
Yeah,	4
{F uh,} then usually they, {F uh,}	24
I don't know that a cat would do that, {F uh } <laughter>.	9
I see.	29
<Breathing>  [ {C An, } + {C and } ] quite honestly  [ I, + I ] feel very strongly that the, man [ ha-, the + ] has no redeeming social  values	9
It was an L X?	8
{C and } I know Manhattan's real expensive	24
{C so } [ af-, +  after ] that I decided,  {D well, } I'm not going to use them at all, and  just try to pay cash for everything	24
they're expensive.	9
yeah,	26
Gosh.	21
Uh-huh.	15
[ That's, + that's ]  in, {F uh, } Texas stadium where the football players, play	24
It wasn't a one dayer.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } if I spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer, {D well, } then I'll around a lot longer,	9
((   ))  I'm from Kentucky originally,	24
{C And then } with Emily it was a neighborhood friend -- -- that kept her.	24
{F Uh, } course, they find that the  choice creates its own hardships in a way because life is not quite as simple even if  it is for your, {D you know, }	9
Uh-huh.	15
Yes.	15
are you from Boston?	7
If there's, too many people that get their hands on one little project, {D you know, }  [ that things, + ] [ they're, + ] [ you get, + [ y-, + you ] miss  ] that overlap -- -- sometimes,	9
{C so } I got [ a g-, + my gun ] and  walked [ to the, + {D you know, } through  the house into the ] garage.	24
It was wonderful.	24
{D Well, } he may have	24
Eighty eighty-eight is what you said?	14
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } they're, certainly not,	9
{F Uh, } {C so. } -	26
{C and } I think a, -	26
{C and } there was, but a very short time	24
<Laughter>  {D Actually, } I just saw a movie, {F uh, } called THE LOST CAPONE.	24
-- {D you know, } when you're sitting there, -	24
{F Um, } I grew up, {F uh, } -	24
Uh-huh.	4
<Laughter>.	20
<Laughter>.	20
{C  so } it became quite a big -- -- # thing,	24
once I get up on the green I'm fine,	24
Me, too <laughter>.	24
# Sure. #	15
{C and } that, -	26
then all the things you hear about them. -	9
<Laughter>.	20
this is the car we want,	25
{C and } it was something, that, {E I mean, }  [ our, + our ] President and our leaders could be seeking God saying, God is it your will  for us to bless this nation with this money,	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } I stayed home for awhile longer.	24
I'm going to have to think of that.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Oh.	15
{C And } [ that's, + # that's, ] [ # because, +  [ I, +  I ] guess,  because ] I'm not into territorialism or  whatever, that we have been in the past.	24
Yeah.	15
You think the C I A doesn't spy?	16
I am a fanatic when it comes to bowling,	24
Oh.	15
I do.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
{E I mean } are you single do you cook every night for yourself?	7
{C And, } {F um, } {C so } [ I, + I ] enjoy, (( just ))  the chorals singing a lot, as well.	24
Yeah.	30
{C but } -- -	26
<laughter>  our biggest way of saving money is then to stop all these deductions, {F um, } {D you know, } is to, -	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C and } it's nicer to just throw them out,	9
{C and } now [ the-, + they ] added mass murder.	24
yeah.	15
#Right.#	15
it came out I guess about a month or, about a month and half ago, something like that.	24
{C And } where do you go?	39
{C and } I feel guilty that  I haven't done that here, haven't taken the time	24
{F Oh, } that's great.	21
# My goodness. #	21
I've seen  [ them d-, +  the chefs on T V do ] that?	24
Every once in a while they come in handy <throat_clearing>.	9
-- boy,	21
you have to water your lawn	9
[  [ Have  you,  + have, ] + have ] you seen this often?	7
Yes,	4
{F Uh, } {F uh, } so  do I,	38
Yeah.	15
{C But } it'll save in some areas,	9
Yeah.	15
{C And } the ones that would open, {F uh, } wouldn't want to stay open <rustling>.	24
it doesn't fit in their little containers	24
No.	33
I think [ the, + the ] minimum age for diving [ [ is, + # is # ] probably, + legal anyway, # would be probably  ] about sixteen.  #	24
I had to talk about gun control with somebody	24
The major things, -	26
right?	23
I know it,	17
No,	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C But } [ at, + at ] evening, {F um, } again, [ you, + they ] have the high tourist area, the river walk area, which is nice,	24
Oh <laughter>.	15
That's what I wondered.	24
{C but } one of our favorites is Pappasito's.	24
[ It's, + it's ] a pretty small little town.	24
{C and, } {D you know, } he strikes out a lot,	24
Virginia.	24
They'll, # say, # -	24
{C and } I pay that off monthly,	24
I think I agree with that very much.	9
{C so } she's real excited about doing that.	24
{D well } the ground will naturally filter out the <<End of document>> ... -	25
{D see } <laughter>. -	26
Why did they do in the freezer?	2
and nothing in the papers.	24
{E I mean } [ some, +  I think some ]  people that had fairly sturdy, {F um, } vehicles or  whatever if they had like a Winnebago or something  and they were farther in away from the water, I think they stayed.	24
Yeah,	36
{F Um. }	26
{C And } maybe [ that's, + that's ] probably the toughest thing in the whole world  [ to, + to ] do.	9
Any handicrafts?	7
I think that when they <breathing>  receive help from us, they want it,	9
I didn't go out there for  about three days, {D you know, } [ {C because } I, +  {C and } I ]  went out there one day and the plant  was [ noth-, + nothing ] left but a stem,	24
# {C And }  ((   )) , # -	26
{C But } it's kids that come home and don't have a mother there -- -- or the kids are at home in the morning and ... -	9
That one was just beyond my imagination.	24
It's hard to believe that nobody can be any more creative than that.	9
{C But } you have good sour dough	9
they just had this jewelry account.	24
{D You know, } [ I've had + {D like, } over the past thirty years I've had, ] {D you know, } about seven or eight different dogs all the time.	24
-- {C and } we didn't know it was there.	24
I feel real good if I water them	24
-- although I've heard rabbits are pretty good --	24
{F Uh, } the last time we had some, {F uh, } friends over for dinner, I tried a dessert that sounded [ wonder-, + wonderful ] in the recipe	24
{F Uh, } there's one science fiction writer named, {F uh, } Allen Dean Foster.	24
Are you really.	21
right.	15
{C so } hey <laughter>.	21
{C and } maybe I'll talk to you again.	38
-- {C and } about a year and a half ago they instituted [ a, + {F uh, } <ringing> a, ] {F uh, } [ drug testing program, + {F uh, } {D well } drug and alcohol <ringing> testing program. ]	24
{D Well, } [ [ I am, + {F uh, } I'm, ] + gosh, I'm ]  barely in Dallas.	24
[ T-, + ] {E I mean, } It would be packed.	9
[ I, + I ] really think that, {F uh, } we spend a lot of time, {F uh, } going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal,	9
{C and } I think that the, -	9
{D Well, } I'm considering  probably some kind of a pickup truck myself for the next vehicle.	24
In a way [ it's good, + it's very good ] to get out with adults,	9
Uh-huh.	15
(( {C Because } )) , -	26
{C so } I know,	24
they went to a trial by jury.	24
{F Oh, } [ [ I, + I'm ] very, + {F uh, } I'm very ] varied as well.	24
what is, oh, I know, -	17
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
he's gotten these catalogs try-, -	24
It's just a matter of how big you build it.	24
# {C And so } th-, # -	26
{F Oh, } yeah,	4
<Groan>.	20
I think so,	36
{C but } I think it probably was [ the, + the ] train.	24
{C and }  it did look like it'd be a good [ mo-, + movie, ]	24
# Which one? #	39
Yeah,	15
Yeah <laughter>.	38
# Yeah,	15
You know how that is,	16
{C and } that must be the thing.	9
No.	33
we got ripped off buying our new car.	9
[ Pre-, + Pretty ] standard.	24
Yeah.	15
{C and }  I don't mind, {D you know, }	24
Yeah,	15
<Laughter>.	20
Yes,	36
# Huh. #	15
you do have a separate area.	30
<Laughter> Got to go take care of the children,	38
I'm settled in a place.	24
Uh-huh.	36
you're not going to do that,  {D you know, }	9
That, {F uh, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } {D now } that's bad.	21
{C and } we had a garden	24
{D Well, } my son works [ in, + {F uh, } for  ] the federal government.	24
{C and } I tape because I'm not home <laughter>.	24
I think my wife has some.	24
{C So } I can't complain too much, {D you know, }	24
And, uh, that may be part of the problem.	9
<Lipsmack> {C but, } {D you know, } they're building the baseball stadium	24
Huh,	36
{D Well, } I like animals,	24
not something to be curious about and not something to  be totally scared about.	9
{C But } it's in the estates that adjoin it.	24
Did I reach the Dallas area?	7
You have to be careful if you go to [ a, + a ] restaurant [ that, + # that ] # really is more adults {D you know, } # with # the atmosphere and everything,	24
Yeah.	15
That's their favorite word.	9
{E I mean, } {D you know, } when I think of this one friend who makes probably twenty thousand dollars a year, [ and + ] I'm sure she spends at least that in clothes, plus, {D you know, } fast food every day, and out to lunch every day,	24
{D Well } it's a whole lot better than that San Francisco # paper	3
yeah.	36
[ [ We, + we don't know, ] + half the time we don't know ] who to support.	9
{F Oh, } okay.	15
What?	14
{C and } I take, {F uh, } DISCOVER magazine, and also, {F uh, } C D AND STEREO REVIEW -- -- and NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, I think -- -- and BOYS LIFE <laughter>.	24
{F Uh, } [ I don't know if we, +  I don't think we've ]  had a frost up here.	24
{C but } where we're at, now our jails are overcrowded.	24
you definitely are going to worry about the location, and, {F uh, } {D you know, } accessibility of people to be able to break in.	9
I'm definitely not aware of how much.	24
{C So } I'm trying to have my children not make the same mistake.	24
{C and so } that's gone now,	24
I do three hundred sit ups a  day now, but not [ at that, +  in the ] morning,	24
no kids <laughter>.	24
{D well, } {E I mean }  L A, Orange County area.	24
No.	13
{C so. } I named her Rosebud,	24
{E I mean, } that's all there is to it,	24
{F Oh, } my goodness.	21
That's a beautiful state.	21
{F uh, } [ the, + there ] is not much incentive for innovativeness -- -- because the limitation for reward is very severe --	9
<Laughter>.	20
<Laughter>.	20
-- {C because } they can't even get the menial job without being able to read something nowadays -- -- {D you know. }	24
{C so } if you, -	26
I didn't get to.	24
{E I mean, } # if # they're going to do it, just deal with it and, # be # done with it.	9
I, {F uh, } attend the Indiana University	24
So we really had a lot of rain.	24
((   )) .	20
I think Plano, don't they have some,	8
[ a, + ] now my grandfather was going to  pay if I went to, {F uh, } what's now U T Arlington, # because # it was there in my hometown,	24
{C And } I don't know what the solution is.	24
{D You know, } we just think, {D well, } the next time has got to be better <laughter>.	24
really.	15
{D So } [ [ if, + you know, it's not, ] + it's ] just a temporary thing.	9
Yeah.	4
{F Um. }  {D Now } that would be good.	9
Is that all they're going to have to make money, {D you know. }	16
Good.	21
this is a foreign country --	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C so } we'll just wait.	18
[ I, + I ] have to say that probably the one movie  that really threw me back the most, {F uh, } that I was really the most in shock with was probably, {F uh, } STAR WARS.	24
Uh-huh.	15
<Noise>.	20
[ I, + I  ] think I do most of the things better than the average person.	24
{F oh, } I see, -	24
{C And } I've seen where some places have  taken a plastic  and, {F uh, } they're recycling them into other plastics. And the Styrofoam also into insulation and things like  that	24
To tell you the truth, I'm not even really from here.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
You are a good one to talk about consumer goods, because you keep up on it all the time.	38
Speaking for myself I don't sleep as well, when I am not exercising,	24
{C or, }  {D you know, } they, -	26
{F Um. }	26
That's right.	36
<Laughter>.	20
I haven't the slightest idea.	24
{F Uh, } it came with a menus program,	24
{D Well, } it's a pleasure talking with you.	38
I'm not counting on it.	24
{E I mean, } they don't, {F uh, } {F uh, } -	26
[ It, + it ] got to be pretty straightforward to understand	24
It took that long.	24
{C But, } -	26
{D well. } -	26
Yeah,	4
a lot of the workers don't understand that, {F uh, } they need to put out the best that they can because it comes right back to them, {D you know. }	9
It doesn't say,	24
Right.	15
# Uh-huh.  #	15
{C So. } -	26
{C and, }  {F uh, } he's about two years old now	24
{C But } I think, {F um, } -	26
{C And } I'm like, baloney.	24
you can't find what you used to,	9
# Uh-huh. #	15
# Yeah. #	15
[ they, +  they ] just have  {D like } outhouses,	24
right or wrong,	24
In fact, it snowed on us [ in, + in, ] {D gosh, } when was that?	24
{C but } I can really tell the difference, since I have not been able to walk.	24
It never gets real, real hot.	24
I don't know,	19
That's, great.	21
[ {C and, } + {C And } ] that seems to be something that [ should, + should  ] really be outlawed. Because it's subject to abuse	9
I went to Lebanon in eighty-three, before the marines ever got there, with the U N Peace Keeping Force.  [ And + ] with the training I received prior to going there, with captured weapons we kept running up against.	24
{C and so, } [ [ w-, + w-, ] + {D you know, } what ]  we do to make contributions so that, basically,  we go and do things like put in high-tech scrubber systems, {F uh, } that, {F uh, } scrub out  the, N O X and, {F uh, } V O C's [ and, + and ] ammonia compounds, {F uh, } like all the acids,  to a certain level.	24
Right.	15
Yeah,	15
{C And, } {F uh, } -	26
talking to the people again about, {D you know, } -	26
[ That's a, +   that's a ] fortunate benefit, {D you know, } that they're so active -- -- for their employees.	9
Okay.	15
It says something like, if people were to give five, hours a week or five percent of their salary, [ we could, + they could ] solve all the world's problems or something.	24
It would mean a lot to the looks of the plate.	9
{C and } they got it finally  semifixed,	24
{C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, }  [ yo-, + ] there's [ a, +  {F uh, } a ]  nice warm feeling,	9
{C but } every weekend a small town will sponsor a rally	24
Yeah.	15
{C And } [ it's, + it's ] fun	24
I've only seen snow once this year.	24
Then I went back to work.	24
I got too much weight on right now.	24
nobody does yeah, then,	9
{C and, } -	26
I see where the infrastructure is sort of breaking down, the roads, the highways.	9
Uh-huh.	15
I guess I'm one of the few people that also prefers baseball to football.	9
Eventu-, at least one time, -	26
have you seen that?	7
Oh.	17
that's their marketing.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{D You know, } {C but } still if you  realize that, {F uh, } one barrel has {D {D like, } how much was it, {D like, } } {F um } forty gallons,	24
{D Well, } I decided that, {D you know, } you need that once  in awhile.  That you, you need to plan the quality time	9
all means about fifteen to twenty percent, # [ of, +  of, ] # {F oh, } -	24
Yep.	4
[  [ I don't know, + [ I, + I ] don't, ] + I really don't know, ] {F uh, }	19
{F Um, } I have a great recipe for sour cream chicken enchiladas --	24
# Clarence Thomas #  or, -	22
{C So } they're happening during the hours they're gone from work.	24
Me, too.	36
# <Wheezing>  <throat_clearing>.  #	20
{D well, } tell me what's in your garden this year, since I don't have one.	18
Yeah,	36
Yep.	15
{F Uh, } anyway, I know [ here in, +   here in ] Plano some of the things that we do are, {F um, } Kroger	24
# [ Do you watch, + # do you watch ] [ the network, +  {D like } major network ] news,	7
Uh-huh,	36
{C And, } -	26
[ Like, + like ] you say it can be, {F uh, } a water ski trip, or fishing trip or just a sightseeing, bird watching, {D you know, } [ hunt, + hunt ] with a camera type of thing	9
[ {C and, } + {C and } ]  the last book, {F uh, } matter of fact I read was, AT AMERICA'S SERVICE by Carl  (( Albrecht )) .	24
<Laughter> Yes,	4
{D So. } -	26
basic.	2
What do you think about that,	31
<Laughter>.	20
{F Oh, } okay,	15
# {F Huh. } #	15
{D Well, } {C but } that's the point, as I would say, {F uh } --	9
it's whether the parent wants to take the risk.	22
Most of the people [ [ who + that i-, ] +   that I ] know about who really, {F uh, } would, [ fa-, +  favor ] statehood, # have # pretty much assimilated into  [ the, +  the ] continental states already.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I think that Plano and Richardson in terms of the, {F uh, } things seriously wrong with the public schools are not nearly to the extent [ th-, + that -- ] -	9
{C And } they are doing it [ un-, + {D you know, } unconsciously. ]	9
{C so } I'm looking at three or four years before my balances are cleared on those charge accounts.	24
{F Uh, } yeah,	4
{D Well } that's great.	21
#  Yeah.	36
{F Oh, } I, -	26
Absolutely,	36
no,	33
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] you, -	26
{C but, }  [  it, +  it's ] really not enough to become a big hassle.	24
It wasn't,	26
{D You know, } # {D now } # -- -- when they have kids around,  you'd think that they would be locking them up	9
there were the sixty-four thousand dollar question shows in the fifties,	24
that's, {F uh, } -	26
right,	11
-- [ [ I don't, + I don't think that you can have, ] +  {E I mean, } there's no way I could have ] a career and then be the kind of mom that I want to be --	9
Uh-huh.	15
#(( )).#	20
{C And } you're recycling <laughter>.	24
I need to probably make a phone call or two <laughter>.	24
Yeah.	15
{C so } -- -- {F uh, } it really makes it easier	9
Uh-huh.	15
<Laughter> That's your full time, {F uh, } hobby, right?	7
{C or } your neighbors going to be watching out for you, {F um, } because [ [ it's, + it's practically, ] + it's ] in their backyard, too,	9
{D you know }  I'm not personally involved because [ I don't, + {D you know, } I don't ]  have any [ s-, + ] children that wear diapers,	24
{C So. }    {D Well, } I guess it worked out.	24
we all got together,	24
I grew up in Michigan,	24
<Sniffing> Yeah.	15
I think that would  be a wonderful way to do it.	9
You could learn that, I'm sure -- -- and pick that up.	9
huh.	15
{C And } everybody's got, {D you know, }  stuff they don't want known.	9
{D Well, } that's different than most people do it.	9
{D Well, } as far as tangible benefits go I would say that, {F uh, } health insurance of all forms is probably my next most important concern.	9
Okay,  Leslie,	15
I think I've seen most of Humphrey Bogart's movies,  but, [ in, + in, ]  {D you know } a long time ago,	24
{C But, } {F uh, } -	26
{C And so, } [ he used, + they used ]  car repairs kind of as a way to have [ a, + ] {D you know, }  something that they did together,	24
{C And then } we have a local rag here in town that -- -- I pick up periodically and read just to see what's going on in our little community. Because we don't get an awful lot of coverage  in the DALLAS MORNING NEWS.	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } they had, [ what, + ] like a ninety-eight percent turnout.	24
{C but, }  {F uh, } unfortunately for him, but maybe fortunately for us, his health is not great,	24
-- [ {C and then, } + {C and } ] [ I keep, + I keep ] rationalizing that  {D well, } {D you know, } I can do it,	24
{C or, } -	26
{C but } there's got to be some control	9
((   ))  <laughter>.	20
<<Pause>> [ Be a, + be a ]  great experience really.	9
{D Well, } I'll have to keep myself [ and, + and ] [ ge-, + get ] on it.	24
Because I work now,	24
-- {C and } now all of a sudden it was being developed,	24
{C And } I use my personal computer constantly,	24
Uh-huh.	4
#  ((   )) . #	20
Yes,	4
Uh-huh.	15
No.	36
{C And } it's fascinating because I had always, {D you know, } been raised on  this, {D you know, } [ (( Emancipation )) + Proclamation ] with the Civil War.	24
{F oh } I started years ago, I guess, not years ago, -	24
[ it, + it ] can still show up	24
Sure.	15
[ I, + {F uh, } I ] -- -- # often desire # to exercise,  often believe I should and rarely do.	24
{F Oh, } {D well, } this is a wonderful thing  [ that, + that ] you're doing here still helping them out.	9
Right.	36
in some   of those, {D you know, } [ they, + I guess they ] retitled some movies that were going to be about   Lebanese [ [ [ and, + and, ] + {D you know, } and, ] + and ] Americans	24
Yeah.	15
# Yeah.	15
We looked at each other.	24
{C and } when the newspaper comes out on Sunday, I sometimes read through the movies that will be listed,	24
<Laughter> (( )) that sounds good to me.	36
{C but } he wasn't.	24
{D You know, }  {D like, } {F uh, } they want [ to, + to ]  format a report a certain way --	9
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] along with that, {D you know, } -	26
a really important thing to me is when [ they, + {F uh, } they ] pay for continuing education.	24
{C and, } in fact, I don't  even like  to use a driver,	24
{F Uh, } yeah,	36
# Oh.  #	29
<Clanging>.	20
#  That's not near, like building a house or anything	9
{C and } it's not like the teacher can just get in there and do her best,	9
I do <children>.	24
{C and } [ they -- + -- they ] say, {D well, } [ it's, + it's ] the law that's, {F uh, } got to be changed instead of their way of life,	9
I don't know whether it's little old ladies living there or what, but you could just tell that they had [ a love, + {F uh, } a love  ] affair with their gardens, with beautiful wild flowers,	24
[ I, + I ] think about [ all, + all ] the money [ that, + that ] we've spent on interest -- -- on all of our credit cards,	24
{D well } she goes all the time	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
What was she driving?	39
Jeez.	21
[ {C But, } + {F uh, } {D you know, } {C but } ] we need  good schools.	9
[ ours, + ours  ] is changing,	24
{F um, } they had to impose a curfew [ that, + ] {F uh, } in two of the areas [ in, + {F uh, } in ]  the Washington suburbs.	24
you have young children, right?	7
I'd kind of, -	26
You do too?	8
{C so }  you'll never be able to get insurance ever again.	9
{C and } I just didn't take as much advantage of it as I should have.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
It's like, let's see if we can get her to run up her bills <laughter>.	24
Okay.	29
We haven't had to look very carefully for child care.	24
my ten year old nephew says things that he is aware of that I am just going, Michael, how did you hear about <laughter> that?	24
{C because } the, -	26
Prepare your, -	2
{C And, } {F um, } -	26
[ Ye-, + ] everybody does, right.	7
Yeah.	15
It's pretty bad.	9
{D so } [ it's, +  it's ]  one that you can live through.	9
Uh-huh.	15
<Lipsmack>.	20
{D You know } [ [ [ that's, + it, ] + it's, ] + it's ] amazing	9
That -	26
the campsite that we went to  was an area that, -	24
{C And } I thought, {D you know, }  that really, -	24
I realized that the air conditioning wasn't cutting in.	24
Yes,	36
{C or, } {D see, } I work at T I.	24
{F Oh, } backless,	15
{E I mean } I don't like guns in general	24
{D You know, } we've -- -- had, {F uh, } the P G A up here.	24
that's exactly true.	36
{C because } it's an association fee.	24
{C and } I'm not sure what needs  to be done to fix it.	24
I bet <laughter>.	21
# Yeah. #	15
{C but, } {F um, } it's, -	26
{E I mean, } it's just the amount that you're overspending,	9
it's unreal.	24
I can drive for, {D you know, } ten hours or so and not really be tired in any way.	24
Ye-,	26
the engine's in excellent shape,	24
{C but } if you don't live near there that's not worth, -	9
{C And then } we went up [ the, + the ] Big Sur  Highway all the way up to San Francisco. [ And, {F uh, } +  and ] then cut across through  the wine country. And then went down [ to, + to, ]  {F uh, } Sequoia National Park.	24
Yeah.	15
There's no restriction  though.	2
{D Well, } we enjoy having pets.	24
I even had, {F uh, } roses on my table for Christmas dinner -- -- which was really pretty, {D you know } <laughter>.	24
but, -	26
# It # -- -- sounds like you all pretty much do it the same we do.	9
I wanted to make sure that I would be  able to afford it, that I wouldn't get through [ four, + three ]  years of the undergraduate work [ and, + and ] have to leave.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Each one of those sectors has got a Soviet general over the troops that are there.	24
Yeah,	15
I was going, {F oh, } {D well }  <laughter>. -	24
We don't have many seasons here.	24
Right.	15
uh-huh.	4
{D Well, } [ does [ your, + ]  the company {D say, } + for instance, does the company ] you worked for [ bef-, + before ] have the right or do they have the ability to say, hey, we've already drug tested her	7
because a lot of states do still practice capital punishment --	9
# Right,	36
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
{C and } particularly [ with, +  with ] back seat,  {F uh, } with some, [ where kids, +  [ were, +  were ] ] sitting in the back seat with seat belts on,	24
<Laughter>.	20
which in QUANTUM LEAP you get -	9
{D We-, } you know that works until they start school.	9
Yeah.	15
A lot of education aid has gone to so-called trade schools -- -- which are sort of not colleges	24
The Sherman facility,  we are still  in the, closer too,  but still have a little bit of, {F um, } finalization to do. -	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } get the computer where it recognizes voices.	24
Oh.	15
No,	33
# Let me see if I can get on a  cleaner line.	37
{C And, } {F uh, } he designed [ [ the, + the, ] + the ]  bullets themselves	24
Is it on the golf course?	7
I heard they had some flooding down there.	24
{C but } General Dynamics and L T V and Bell have lost project after project, {D you know. }	24
[ I, + for years I ] did all that shopping and whatnot,	24
I had to press one.	24
[ [ [ I, +  I, ] +  I, ] +   I ] feel that way when movies are {D like } blown up, out of proportion, {D you know -- }	24
{D Well } -- -- {F um, } [ I, + I ] just think the way  that things are going that, {F um, } it would be good for young people to go ahead and [ have, + {F um, } dedicate ]  themselves to at least something.	9
[ Th-, + they ] give the person the option for a jury.	24
Right.	15
{C but } [ they've gotten, + they've got  ] to pay for all that national advertising now.	24
I'm like I know it will be fun the first week maybe,	24
{C and, } {F um, } I sang all through college and things like that	24
#  Really.	15
in looking, bu-, -	26
Yes,	4
yeah.	15
Okay,	29
Yeah.	15
she'd be outside,	24
{C And then } I left right in the middle of it.	24
there's three of us to cover in Dallas facilities	24
{E I mean, } first, -	26
{C But, } {F um, } it, {D you know, } -	26
{C and, }  {F uh } <throat_clearing>. -	26
{C Or } something you haven't paid in sixty days or ninety days, {D you know. }  And things like that <throat_clearing>. -	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } I guess Hawaii is one of my favorite places.	24
When it was, -	24
I had one of the ladies at church that tasted my coconut cream pie	24
a huge amount of it is not the fault of the contractor.	9
{C And } it's not their job to fight for their own land.	9
Let's face it.	19
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	4
{C and } [ you, +  one's ] feeling obligated, because of some sense [ of, + of ]  the way the ritual is played out.	9
okay.	29
Phew <<almost like a whistling sound>>.	21
{F Uh, } yes.	36
{C and } {F um, } {D well, } it's got a lot, {E I mean, } pages and  pages.	24
Out of, which direction from there?	39
{C or }  if they don't have that, {F uh, } -	24
at least you're hitting the books, right.	7
[ You're, + you're ] making me hungry here.	24
I haven't had to.	5
[ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] [ I watch the, + {F uh, } actually I watch the ] morning news before I leave for work.	24
sure.	21
{C and, } {F uh, } [ you, + you  ] stand on the edge and [ you, + you  ] cast out and  [ you, + you  ] work, {F uh, } from your feet most of the time --	24
Yeah,	15
# My goodness. #	21
# I am going to # need a vacation <laughter>.	24
{C And } of course, it's institutional food,	24
{F Uh, } {C and } you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract, {F uh, } sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home.	9
{C so, } we're getting to the point where we really kind of need something a little bigger than what we've got,	24
{C But } I like it hot,	24
Finance.	24
{C and } they didn't understand her,	24
Yeah,	4
Thank you.	10
Uh-huh,	15
{D Well, } it depends,	17
{C but } they give him a lighter sentence, thinking he's not a habitual criminal.	24
{F Oh, } <laughter> {D well } I hope I don't run across them.	24
# I think so too.  #	24
[ Do you, + do you ] test each individual one --	7
{D So, } -	26
isn't it?	23
Yep.	36
{C because } {D actually, } {F um, } when I was in college I visited Mexico several times,	24
{C but, } {F uh. } Uh-huh.	26
we almost one day, -	26
All my income goes for things like luxuries,	24
[ what do, + what do ] you do?	39
you, # want to # rob a bank?	7
Just real aggravating to <breathing>	2
{C and } those are so neat.	9
{C But } [ it's, + it's ] basically all brick.	24
exactly.	36
{F Um. }	15
{C and } you're going to run.	9
{D well } mine's getting there.	24
I'm just [ getting, +  getting ] to that age  I guess.	24
<Laughter>.	20
of course, we do have capital punishment.	24
[ [ A, + a, ] + a ] team effort,	22
{F Uh, } # I'm an editor.  #	24
All it was, -	26
(( Damn it )) , I agree [ with + pretty much with ] everything you've said.	24
[ I, + I ] agree with you.	36
{C And, } {F uh, } I had this wonderful recipe	24
[ Ye-, +  yes, ]	4
Right.	15
A lot of people choose to, which is fine.	9
{F Um, } {D well, } the conductor gets paid a little bit, {D you know, }	11
Uh-huh,	15
Uh-huh.	15
It's all brick,	24
They won {D like } just one game	24
{C so } -- -	26
{C and } the woman is looking to how easy can she slide in under the steering wheel. {F Uh, } can her makeup come off the upholstery <laughter>.	9
It's been a long time.	24
Really.	15
I did the same thing.	24
{D Well, } the types of vacations that I usually take, -	24
It's not too hard,	9
[ I, + I  ] really don't, -	26
Right.	15
that is great.	9
Yeah,	15
{C but } almost inevitably to a station that is a classical, {F uh, } station here #  ((   )) , # for music purposes.	24
Uh-huh,	15
<Laughter>.	20
{C And so } we said, great, {D you know, }	24
{C and } I have to admit I have a certain resistance to the idea of exercising for exercising's sake,	24
It certainly is,	36
{C and, } -	26
no,	36
{D Well, } [ that's good + -- -- that's good, ]  that's sounds like a lot of fun.	21
{E I mean, } they were, {F uh, } {E I mean, } -	26
[ they are, + they are ] a fat.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } you can't afford to stay once you get there # <laughter>. #	9
Okay.	15
Uh-huh,	15
[ it is a, + it is really a ] nice area.	9
{C and } the young one goes for a while,	24
{D see } [ I have, +  I have ] a tendency to, [ a, +  adopt ] teams when I [ [ wen-, +  go to a tea-, ] +  {F uh, } go to a town. ]	24
Yeah.	15
but I think people are too lawsuit happy.	9
Yeah.	15
yeah.	15
It's lopsided, very much	9
Save the fees, -	26
Day cares [ [ have, +  have, ] +   have ] popped up and become [ a lot more, +  {F um, } a lot bigger ] part [ of, + of ] the kids'   lives.	9
Do it remotely just looking at [ the, + ] what they do,	24
I know.	36
{C and } you see, -	26
I'm enjoying the chat.  {F Uh. }	24
{D Well, } that sounds interesting.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Yes.	15
okay.	15
{C But } [ if you do, + if you do ] have to  go something, I guess we can just cut off.	38
I want to see that.	24
We rarely have to take those things in too.	24
{F Oh, } my God, you do everything.	24
{C but, } -	26
you better have some other way of, {F uh, } savings,	9
{C and } really we <laughter> <noise> -	26
{C So } [ that's, + that's ] really, -	9
they call you one time  to send three kids to the [ car-, -- + -- carnival ] or circus	24
it never gets real cold.	9
He likes to help me design, {F um, } {D you know, } projects that are, a little more customized.	24
Really?	12
{C and } now I work a full school day,	24
I've been wanting to go to the West Texas, and see different parts of Texas, because I haven't lived here very long,	24
Are you from Texas?	7
{C and, } {F uh, } John Chriswell is, {D anyway, } the, -	24
I'm not sure how we get that,	24
{C But, } {F uh, } {D you know, } find out when they are holding <<pause>> the petroleum fair, {F uh, }	18
Yes,	4
{D so, } {F uh, } you live in Dallas?	7
{C But, } {D you know, }  when I first moved here [ was when they, + {D well, } {E no, } I guess it was about a year ago they ] did this.	24
Yeah.	15
yeah.	15
Okay,	13
<Laughter>.	20
-- {C but, } [ I, + ] historically, Texas <phone_ringing> has had mud and muddier campaigns --	24
Yeah.	15
I just laugh.	24
you can get the little curly hair -- -- at the craft shop.	24
{C And then } there are some students that, {D you know, }  read well at five years old, and, {D you know, } seem to excel.	9
[ we had  cat, + {D you know, }  my family had cats ] when we were growing up the whole time until my Mom developed an allergies,	24
Because, <laughter> you know, they take,	24
When I was younger I thought it was, {F uh, } <sniffing> a sign of a civilized society if you didn't have, {F uh, } capital punishment	24
I think probably in a small, -	9
Whereas if you're ripping wood,  you're probably better off with [ a, +  a ] table saw.	9
<Laughter>  Yes.	36
Thank you very much.	38
{C but } when I went to college [ it was, + I felt ] like I couldn't support myself if I decided to be a photographer -- -- that it would just have to be a hobby,	24
Okay.	29
<Beep> Okay.	13
{C And } I think that is what it is going to have to come to. Where we are just forced to. -	9
when we get an hour more, -	26
# sure.  #	15
Yeah,	36
Okay.	15
Yeah,	15
{F uh } -- -- {C and } I'm very eager [ to, + to ] start, {F uh, }	13
Yeah.	15
So that's probably where the first place we'd look.	24
Uh-huh.	15
# Uh-huh.  #	15
[  I, + I ] am from Denver --	24
Oh.	15
They're always [ in, + in  ] Hawaii some place. [ On, + on  ] the beach.	24
{D now } wait a minute,	17
in Garland.	24
Yeah,	4
{C But, } {F uh, } I know your voice in your own head resonates a different way.	24
Right.	15
Huh-uh.	33
Silver plated bowls and stuff.   There's a lot of stuff, it's a big booklet.	24
Oh.	15
[ [ [ I, + I ] could see, + I could see ]  that point, + I could see ] how it would be.	24
{C but } when I go out somewhere, then, {F uh, } unless I have a pair of dress slacks, I don't usually wear a lot of blue jeans.	24
Uh-uh.	15
[ [ [ That's, + {F uh, } # that's,  ] #  + that's, ] + that's ] a big part of my decision.	24
# {C So } it came # -- -- really great #	9
{C So } at one point I had a snake, skunk, dog and cat running loose in the house.	24
I know that, {F uh, } {F uh, } [ one of, + one ] thing that happens [ to us + to ] vacation trips now is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family.	24
Uh-huh.	15
What's going to happen?	16
{F Oh } {D well, } take care.	38
{C And } [ there really, + there really ] was not a choice,	24
Uh-huh,	15
<lipsmack> {C and } it's real good	24
<Laughter> Yeah.	36
{D Now, } we have several friends that, {F uh, } have been on, and just love them.	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C but } I think  that there should be some preset penalties in criminal cases.   Rather than, {F uh, } degrees of # sentencing. #	9
they are.	36
Right,	36
{C bu-, } I was surprised to learn that so few countries have capital punishment.	24
I like the IHOP there in Plano.	24
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] daddy would always try to prove he could catch fish for breakfast --	24
{C And, }  {F uh, } of course, [ those can be, + they can be, ] {F oh, } a long time apart	24
{D Well, } {F uh, } {F uh, }  [ your, +  you said your ] family was [ gro-, +   {F uh, } all grown ] up now,	24
Okay,	13
# {C and } she's # six months	24
{C so } you have probably a lot of green, and lot of real pretty things.	9
I use {F uh, } Citibank, the, {F uh, } Advantage one -- -- pretty much cause you get vantage points for every dollar you spend.	24
{C And } what do you think you'll do with that?	31
{C and } if they were to administer this, they would, {F uh, } <laughter> get us more and more into debt, further than we can ever get out ourselves.	9
<laughter>.	20
{C or } [ we, + {D you know, } we ] do everything we can possibly as a family.	24
I told him [ yo-, + ] if you want to give me a present for Christmas give me a backpack.	24
<Laughter> {D Well, } it was nice talking to you.	38
{F Uh, } {C and } I'm nonexempt.	24
#  ((   )) . #	20
They, -	26
{C and } in the mi-, {D you know, } -	26
{E I mean, } for some people, that's just, {D you know, }  that's out of the question, {D you know. }	9
they're shorts.	24
{C and } I grew up a Bear fan.	24
{C But, } on the other hand, I don't mind that it's only on, {D you know, }  things that aren't like  <throat_clearing> groceries and that,	24
Okay.	15
oh.	15
but there is not exactly a lot of, uh, physical responsibility there.  *[[listen; probably 'fiscal' not 'physical']]	9
Whereabouts is that?	39
{C but, }  {E I mean, } when I heard his album, I heard it and it was just incredible.	24
{F Oh, } # {D well, } I guess, # [ if I, + if it ] was someone in my family, I'd probably feel that way.	9
{C and } they couldn't find it anyplace,	24
Yeah,	15
I'm not sure what you do.	24
# Yeah. #	15
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } what subjects have you talked about?	39
{E I mean } it kind of runs in, <laughter>  in batches,	9
<Lipsmack> <breathing> She, -	26
I like Michael J. Fox a lot.	24
yeah.	15
yeah	4
-- in fact,   I think they were watching something on, {F uh, } whales, or killer [ sh-, + sharks, ] one or the other -- -- couple of weeks ago over here --	24
{C But } nobody can get one more point to become, {D you know, } {D like } whatever you need to earn # so much money. #	24
Ten,	24
{C and } within two hours, there were fifteen boys sitting there  doing the same thing.	24
H-, -	26
{C and } there's, {D you know, } financial gains toward that.	9
Uh-huh.	15
I was going to say, my sister wasn't spoiled very much.	24
it's tempting,	9
{C and } the ones above would.	24
you know, it, -	26
{D You know, } it gets it down to about forty.	24
Uh-huh.	15
when he starts toddling around and stuff.	24
# {F uh, } # I, -	26
Yeah.	4
that's scary.	9
Yeah,	36
{C and, }  {F uh, } -	26
Measure it and get it to, -	22
right.	11
# Yeah,	26
{C and } that creek that had been fifty or sixty feet from our site of our tent was now about three feet away <laughter>.	24
I'd kind of like, someday, to maybe end up on a pair of skis [ that, +  that ] doesn't have a, {F uh, }  {D well, } -	24
Are they big into [ am-, + ambiance ] down there	7
That's exactly right.	9
# we have to drive # so far,	24
{F Oh, } of course.	36
{C But, }  {F uh, }  in fact I didn't eat out that much there because I was traveling by myself in a car,	24
# {D well, } you take Israel --	24
[ {C and, } +  {C and, } ] {F uh, }  [ i-, + ] she hasn't sewed anything in a long time	24
Uh-huh.	15
What a cute idea.	21
I had to drive to the store --	24
{C and } [ I did  the, +  [ I, + I ] did one ] that was, the demonstration of a [ touch, + touch ] screen for a company that sells, {F uh, } touch screens.	24
Uh-huh.	15
It really is that they  haven't found [ anything, +  anything ] better that, {F uh, } -	9
{C so } -- -	26
I was going to say it's kind of hard to have, have an opinion.	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
No,	33
-- [ {C but, } + {C but, } ]  it was interesting  to,	26
Okay <laughter>.	13
Yeah.	15
I hardly ever go see a sequel.	24
{D Well, } most Texans will jump in their car to drive across the street.	9
[ {C but, } + {C but, } ] {F uh, } tell me [ what, + ] {F uh, } <lipsmack> where you'd catch crappie.	28
{C because } I have, -	26
Okay,	13
{C and } they go out to, -	24
{C and } they keep dragging  it on,	24
yeah.	15
{C So, } we are planning on going two or three times a week <laughter>.	24
-- {F uh, } I guess we will have to factor that in if we are not working for employers that happen to fund that.	24
it seems like the stuff that they  put out now, it, {E I mean, } [ I, + ] doesn't just seem like it,	9
# {C so } you be will home with your  kids [ I + ] {D you know }	24
Yeah.	15
<Throat_clearing>.	20
It was impossible for missionaries to [ do, + ] accomplish  anything in China -- -- because of all that,	24
{C And } [ we, + we ] cut them up and sent them back because [ we, + we ] hadn't even applied for them,	24
{D Well, } right now the place where I'm living,  the yard was basically neglected for about the last twenty-five years,	3
{C and, } [ it, + it ] gets very difficult to, {F uh, } {F uh, } -	24
I think we're starting to see it a little bit now,	9
Yeah,	15
[ I can bel-, + I can believe ] that.	21
{C But, }  {F uh, } a lot of the little Barbie sets <ringing> they come with real <throat_clearing> little pieces <noise>	24
{C And } you get them for I think it's about fifty cents  apiece at the grocery store you, {F um, } usually buy them by the dozen.	24
Sometimes I think that might not be a bad idea <laughter>.	9
I know where my daughter works,	24
"{D So } did they scratch [ those, + {F uh, } that ] Star Wars deal, {D you know, } they one we was all worried about -- <+ the ""they"" in this sentence should probably be a ""the""+> -- Russia and all that?"	7
{C And } I got about  [ two, + two-thirds ] of it done,	24
Yeah.	15
{D You know, } {C but } people that,  *[[slash error with a.47]] # {D you # know, } don't have anything to hide. -	26
we had five children,	24
{C and } suppor-, -	26
-- {C so } [ it's, + it's ] just once in a while we get the special gathering with everyone together.	24
Right.	15
{C But, } {F uh, } yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
uh-huh. #	15
[ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {C so } ] [ I've, + I've ] lived with  ((   ))  pounds and inches and found it really quite easy to convert over.	24
Yeah.	4
{D well, } [ they, +  they've ]  been having some problems, {F uh, } even here in, {F uh, } {D like } Baltimore City which is, [ a, +  a, ]  [ pretty good ci-, +  [ goo-, +  good ] sized city. ]	24
if you pay it that way it, {E I mean, } [ it really is, + it's ] like getting a free loan for a while. Which is what I do.	24
[ My, + {F uh, } my ] ex-husband's  grandmother had been in a nursing home now for, {F oh, } it must be seven, eight years,	24
I've got the same attitude.	24
[ I'm, + I'm ] a single mom,	24
I was just saying that way, -	24
Why don't you go ahead and start off <laughter>.	18
[ # I, + I ] noticed that a lot of gas stations are telling you to recycle your oil.	24
{C So, } # I'm looking for something, {F uh, } [ littler # -- + -- bigger, ]	24
{C So } when they rebuilt that school,  they had [ a, + a ] top of the line, high tech school there.	24
{C And  then } when the kids get to school,  they try to take away a lot of things that they can do to discipline the kids.	9
right.	15
Right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
# <Laughter>. #	20
{E I mean, } {D you know, } nothing totally radical,	9
{C and, } To be honest, [ I, + I ]  really have not been accounting,	24
this is my first time to do it.	24
{C because } some of those companies that are doing it [ have, + save  ] money eventually.	24
{C and, }  it's really beautiful,	24
I remember that stink came around   in the design area a few years back when it was all overseas designs were in microns	24
{C but } at the same time I think it would do them a world of good.	24
Yeah,	4
Uh-huh.	15
I'm sure people around me really   enjoyed it # <laughter>	9
<Laughter>.	20
# {C So. } #  Yeah.	26
I used to do that,	24
{F Uh, } {C and } [ I, + what I've ] learned to do is just tune  out everybody's opinion.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } the sky, -	26
# That's cute. #	21
Yes.	36
{C and } that was a no no.	24
{D You know, } I just feel they do better that way.	9
{C But } I try and catch most of those  programs <throat_clearing> on Wednesday's and Friday's	24
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } goodness.	21
{C but } [ I just, + I ] don't demand a lot for myself	24
{C and } [ that, + that ] cost more, -	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } if you don't you'll perish.  Either by the hand of [ [ your, + your, ] + your ] master or by being pushed out in the woods.	9
[ That's, +  a lot of people don't have that ] much space even.	9
Yeah,	15
[ Are, + are ] they living independently, right now?	7
# {D Well, } # yeah.	36
As long as you can still buy a product in the English units,  that's how you're going to think of it.	9
Yeah,	15
{C but } like I said, requiring it would be, {F uh, } -	9
Right.	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } also, they're under  a law, because we haven't been removed from the law	9
[ We have, +  we  (( could ))  have ]  credit cards running down our ears.	24
# {C and } # [ I, + I ] like a lot of different  ethnic foods.	24
{F Uh, } power plants since, -	24
[ [ It's a, + it's a rough <laughter>, ] + It's [ a rough, a rough ] ] situation.	9
{F Uh, } {C and } it was fabulous.	36
go ahead.	18
{D Well, } they have like a three year waiting list.	24
might be really useful.	9
Uh-huh.	15
I was a substitute teacher for about a year.	24
In what way?	39
#Uh-huh.#	15
They're all so  different.	9
{C So, } do you play golf at all?	7
[ [ I, + I, ] + I ]  always prefer to go to something that seems more family run. {F Uh, } some place where you seem to have the attitude like you're going into their home for dinner almost.	24
you need to get them into this,	25
right,	15
{C but } still I would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone.	24
{C but, } {D well, } -	26
((   ))  the year that Danny Aines was there.	24
{C But } I do think, -	9
{C And } I think we'll see a lot more.  Don't you?  Of upper management? <Swallowing> Then we do now, even.	7
{D Well, } so far my wife and I have pretty much had to  stick with tent camping.	24
{F Um, } it's not [ r-, + ] terribly demanding.	9
{C And } I'm preparing for retirement.	24
{D so, } -	26
{C so }  they mailed me the information that I filled out  ((   )) .	24
like I say, [ lot of, + lot of ] cases is usually just apartments [ and, + and ] break ins and things like that	9
that's the other reason,	24
{C or } did you folks do that?	35
Yeah.	15
I think that's really, {F uh, } probably what started the whole process.	9
Yes.	15
{C but, }  {D you know, } <breathing>  when you can't even, send them on their normal activities in safety, [ it, + it's ] really frightening.	9
<Laughter> Well --  -	15
-- {D Well, } it's a big tourist town, {D you know, }	24
Yeah.	15
he was fast.	24
Yes,	4
<Lipsmack> {F Um. }	17
Uh-huh.	15
{C So } [ we  always, +  he ] watches that	24
{C so } they are not quite as much of a responsibility	24
{C so, } yes,	4
I guess I think it was, {F uh, } {F uh, } not that great that we were in there, {F uh, } in terms of for how long it lasted.	9
Yeah.	15
[ I'm only, + I'm ] twenty-three	24
{D Well, } perhaps if there are regulatory, {F uh, } constraints put back in place. It will protect that	9
Beg your pardon?	14
{C So } we had to sit there, {D you know, }	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
uh-huh.	15
{F Um, } {C and } it -	26
Depends on how old the tapes are at that time.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } yeah.	36
no,	33
They just need a yard.	9
# {F Oh, } it doesn't? #	7
Uh-huh.	15
[ that, + {F um, } what is that ] {D like, } [ child, + Kinder ] Care and -- -- things like that,	24
to me, all this, {F uh, } space exploration that we've done thus far has told us that there's no other place like earth.    That, {F uh,  }  we can't live on Mars.	24
{D Well, } {D see, } we're in a real small county area,	24
{C and } I think sometimes it's,  {D you know } -- -- maybe a little biased, {D you know } --	9
{C and } now there's so many other  things, where are the kids, what are they doing, {D you know, } where is this person coming in from,	24
Yeah.	15
-- {C and } she said, {D hey } I don't make  [ fun + <<mispronounced>>, fun ] of your friends	24
{C and } I think every woman ought  to deal with it or, ought to at least be exposed to it,	9
{E I mean, } [ I, + I ] don't blame anybody when they have to work <laughter> -- -- because, {F um, } -	24
It was {D like } just a continuum.	24
{C and then } recently [ we, + we ] made [ a, + ] [ the + ] command decision to go ahead and get, {F uh, } the absolute top of the line because spouse is a, {F uh, } programmer.	24
Then you remove it,	18
<Breathing> <laughter> Do you have [ a lot of property, +  {E I mean }  a lot of yard around your house ] now, in Denton?	7
-- [ [ the, + the, ] + the ] company that I work for, {F uh, } has just [ recently, + {D well, } {D you know, } within the last couple of years, ] instituted for all new hired employees, -	24
{C and } it's a indoor fun park	24
Uh-huh,	15
Wow,	21
[ {C And, } + {F uh } -- -- {C and } ] I tell her, {D you know, } No problem, Mom, always got a place for you.	24
Right.	15
[ I, + I ] used to, -	26
{C And } it's really bad, {D you know. }	9
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
# Right #  <TV>.	38
{C and } I think it's been probably about five and a half minutes or something.	24
{C and } they called and told us though, that all you have to do is turn the off switch,	24
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
no.	36
<Laughter>  (( I know that )) .	24
Okay.	15
{D So, } {F uh, } what things do you consider  an invasion of privacy?	31
Yes,	4
{D now } rifles aren't too bad,	9
{C But, }  she seems to me to be, {D you know, } pretty quick and smart	24
I'm not talking about your isolated occurrences,	24
# Your time [ is, + is  ] # -- -- valuable,	9
{F Oh, } that's a, -	26
I just feel m-, -	24
Uh-huh.	15
do you have kids?	7
[ We have a, + [ S-, + my husband ] and I, we have a ] pickup truck	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
That, -	26
Bye.	38
She was, {F um, } <Lipsmack> at a private, {D well, } -	24
we can handle it	9
yeah.	36
{C but, } {D well } [ i-, +  mi-, ] -	26
nobody cares, [ no, + nobody's, ] # really # paying, -	9
# Or just [ a by-, + # an innocent bystander ]  or somebody got actually beat to death or what.	7
I lived in Plano,	24
-- because that was, that was where I kept all my stuff,	24
during the night seems like they'd blow off [ their, + their ] stacks from, {F uh, } the warehouses, for powerhouses,	24
the other big change I see [ in, + in ]  woman's lives is, {F um, } <laughter> to remain biological	9
{C And, } {F uh. } -	26
I could live at home.	24
{C and } <laughter> this is kind of an unusual use for that type of thing.	24
{C and } my one grandmother says that she wants to stay in her house for as long as possible.	24
# <Laughter> Let alone # what I end up having to pay <laughter>.	24
<<Resumes talking to Speaker B>> Yeah,	15
{D Well, } [ they can't, + they can, ] I think in the punishment phase -- -- but not in the guilt or innocence because [ he hasn't been, + he hasn't been ] found guilty of it.	24
as far as using them outside that [ I'm not, + I ] don't use them too much	24
{C but } there's only one, -	24
we ought to just admit it perhaps -- -- and then try and somehow subsidize it in a way that's more fair.	9
it, -	26
<laughter>.	20
# Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } okay.	29
to me it's really, {F um, } -	9
Yeah.	15
{C So, }   I don't know why the two of them happen, to be my two favorite shows,	24
{C and so } it {D like, } {D you know, } did something to their spinal cord --	24
{F Uh, } they're all grown up.	3
Yeah,	15
No,	33
{D Well, } our grass, like I said is just grass.	3
{D Well, } they are exciting, aren't they?	7
I know they are putting President Bush right now in an awkward position concerning [ the, + The ] treaty over there right now.	24
I used to live in Arizona,	24
{C and } it took us about six weeks of in and out of the vet and surgery	24
{C and } now they're feeding them, {F um, } quiche and all kinds of strange food that we would eat.	24
Okay,	29
[ [ [ I, + I'm, ] + I'm, ] + of course, I'm ] a T I -er,	24
Yeah.	36
{F Um, }	15
{C And } I think the, {F uh, } attitude is a lot better towards the parents raising the younger ones now.	9
{C And } [ I, + {D you know, } I'm ] uncomfortable with that much power being in one place.	24
Yeah,	15
{C So, } I feel pretty safe out here	24
I going to try to dump it out this  weekend in fact.	24
{C and } <inhaling> I guess air traffic controllers.  I wouldn't want them to be <laughter> on drugs. And airplane pilots.	24
I really do.	24
whatever the employer says you have to be back at work is basically when you have to be back at work, whether it be six weeks or three or four.	9
We try to take her out right before we go to sleep,	24
# Then don't, # -	26
{C or } were you given? -	35
I li-, -	26
{C and, } it   those who don't vote would have voted exactly the same way, {D you know, } in other words if forty percent had voted for that person and sixty percent for the other, just like everyone who did vote, it's not clear to me that it is really a problem, {F um. }	9
{C So } they're professionals?	8
No,	33
{C And } what they've done is they've bought Mercedes after Mercedes after Mercedes is what they've done,	24
no,	32
Right.	36
Uh-huh.	15
-- yeah.	15
{C so, } -	26
By hand.	24
[ [ It's, + it's, ] + it's ] very # good. #	24
-- {C and, } {F uh, } I fairly enjoyed at that time. -	24
Uh-huh,	15
# next # thing you know,  [ it's, + it's ] -	26
{C and } I hope you  get some more calls and make some more calls.	38
people would have said, why are you going to work.	9
it's [ [ a, +  an old, ] + another old ] book that I happen to have.	24
[ in, +  {F uh, } in ] Texas I'll say	24
{C And, } {D you know, } the nursing home was the, {D you know, } best facility to put her in. {D You know, } besides moving her up which is not a practical solution since both my parents work	9
{C So, } yeah.	15
Make it a little more convenient.	9
<Laughter>.	20
I don't subscribe to either,	24
They're able to move in while they're still independent -- -- and still social	24
{D Well, } {F um, } did you, -	26
[ {C and } + -- -- {C and } ] that's real nice.	9
[ I, + I ] like to watch {D like }  SIXTY MINUTES and TWENTY TWENTY.	24
{F um, } it goes back to the things like drug screening	24
{C So, }  it keeps them busy.	24
Right,	36
# {F Uh, } I caught # -- -- it real early.	24
GOOD HOUSEKEEPING is the one that kind of sets around for [ when, + {F uh, } when ] I'm really have time and I really want to read something, {D you know. }	24
{C so } how ever many bags of garbage you throw away, that's how many you have to pay for.	24
true enough.	36
[ she's, + she's ]  picked up a lot of things, {F uh, } [ just, + just ]  by, {F uh, } teaching by force, I guess is what I'd like to say.	24
{C And } it will help tremendously.	9
{E I mean, } I could the way, -	26
Right.	15
It's got, -	26
{C And so }  you'd have to -- -- start all over -- -- to build that up probably.	22
Right.	15
{C cause } it kind of gets into your personal life, {D you know. }	9
You can get out there,	24
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] there's big differences, of course,	9
We do the same thing.	24
Then he's automatically, {F uh, } given a drug test.	24
Oh <laughter>.	15
{C So, } {F uh, } there was something else I was going to, -	24
<Throat_clearing>.	20
I don't work at T I.	24
[  # The, + {D you know, } the ] floors, [ you could just, + ] # if # you're walking on them, feel how filthy they were.	24
It's north of Salt Lake City, Utah --	24
Yeah.	15
{C but, } -	26
Right.	15
{C and so } people kept piling stuff in the same place, where it used to be.	24
[ [ I'm, + I, ] +  I ] don't know what other foe that would be,	24
{F Oh, } okay.	29
Uh-huh.	15
{C But, } {D you know, } it's funny.	24
{D Well, } I think, -	26
{F Uh, } we pretty much hire, -	24
yeah.	15
Put it on the lease.	18
it, -	26
[ I, +  I ] guess I should have specified,	9
I en-, -	26
I think that's what the subject is about.	9
that is not,	9
{C but } # {E I mean, } we usually get, -	24
# the # only girl.	24
Yeah,	15
{C So } if you don't see anything  coming out of a stack the opacity is zero or twenty or thereabouts.	24
{F Um, } {C and } he's not interested in letting his twenty-one year old daughter experiment with it probably.	8
it was complicated,	9
I think Mobil was doing very well, too.	24
you know they're redoing that and going to make it [ a museum, + a national museum. ]	24
{C And } I said {D well } where are the other three.	24
To me, half the time it's more fascinating than some of these made up stories <laughter>.	24
Otherwise they're pretty smelly <laughter>.	9
# Yeah.	36
{C and then } [ s-, + {D you know, } we ] just goofed up the medical insurance and the car insurance and stuff and <laughter> blew it <laughter>.	24
Right.	15
{C and } she was kneeling,	24
{F Oh, } okay.	29
I have,  my husband and myself and we have two sons who are drivers -- -- [ and + ] one of which is [ a, + {F um, } an  ] eighty-eight Plymouth Voyager Van,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Inhaled so much of it,	2
And, uh, most of the time with a three year old we're trying to, to get him, uh, -	24
God.	21
Yeah,	15
# Uh-huh. #	15
<Inhaling> I am more into rock and roll myself.	24
Did you?	7
{D Like, } {F uh, } probably -- -	26
Right.	36
{C and, }  {F uh, } there was one year when [ my father was,  + {F uh, } my father's company was ] starting to do stuff down in Los Angeles,	24
{F Oh, } I see.	29
Well, maybe it's a matter of, you know, voter awareness.	9
{C but, } you have to have loyalty,	9
I just came back to find jeans for the little one	24
{D You know, } when I sat there, [ I, + {D you know, } I  ] dropped my car off for tires or  something like that.	24
CHINA CRY was basically [ the, +   the ] true story written by [ this, +  this ] lady who [ had, + {F uh, } <lipsmack> was ]  [ a native, +  a native ] Chinese, {F uh, } {F uh, } who was raised by Christian parents.	24
I missed that question, totally, {E I mean } really bad.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } {D you know, } it didn't even bend the frame.	24
Course, one of them was just [ [ a, +  a, ] +  a ] brand new baby twenty years ago,	24
{D You know, } they give you an opportunity  to either transfer into an [ on going, +  on going ] project. -	24
Right.	15
[ It, + it ] looks like a grub.	24
Yea. *[[is this a typo?]]	4
{F Um. } That's interesting.	9
{C and } he gives very practical financial advice about cars, very, {D you know, } [ not, + not ] nothing college level, basic stuff.	24
That is right.	36
{C And } they suspected may have been a tornado.	24
Green.	2
I am glad,	21
I said, okay, because I'm not a swimmer.	24
{D Well, } the particular bathroom that we  did is a half bath,	24
{C but, } {F uh, } they weren't that successful,	24
I'm not really familiar.	24
-- then they should pay taxes then.	9
That's right.	36
{F Uh, } much less than what I need to.	24
# {C But, } # -	26
Good luck.	38
{F Oh, } that's right,	24
{C and then } throw them in with the rest of your salad sometimes.	18
{C because } it's totally different concept to us.	9
Bye now.	38
he plays with them all time,	24
{C but, } {F uh, } I don't know.	19
# Oh. #	15
{C And, then } we also put sausages on a bun,	24
{D well, } is it [ that, + one of those ] Amaryllis?	7
{C and then } it keeps all the chemicals in balance.	9
we couldn't allow him to run free,	24
{C and } they have a couple of kids that are almost my kids age.	24
[ {C And, } + {C and }  ] these women that are waiting until they're in their late thirties, or early forties to have their first children, I think are absolutely crazy.	9
{F Oh, } {F um, } I think I'd still go with the Cadillac.	24
[ It'd be + {D like, } it'd been  ] {D like } deactivated as far as -- [ -- [ s-, + s-, ] + smell ] and everything,	24
{C but } then, get to a point where she just had  to get out of her seat and we had to stop,	24
{C so } I have concentrated on watching James Bond movies, <Laughter> this week <laughter>.	24
That's definitely got to be <laughter> the biggest thing, is that everybody's out there working -- -- including me <laughter>.	9
{C and } of course we don't   have the receipt any more,	24
yeah,	4
{C But, }  it's kind of like if you want a gun you  can get a gun, especially if you have the money to pay for it.	9
that's true.	36
[ I, + I ] can go on and on about football,	24
So much for Circuit City.	9
My business is, {F uh, } machine tool sales,	24
{C and } we kept that going for about a month	24
<Laughter>.	20
Oh.	15
{C so } we kept going out  until we figured we hit a point where we need the traffic,  time to get into work,	24
{D [ yo-, + you  ] know, }  [ something like, + something like,  ] {D well } you can't be tried for the same trial because that would bias [ [ [ the, + the,  ] + the,  ] + the  ] jury or something,	9
yeah,	36
-- I'm thinking White Narcissus or something -- -- [ like a pa-, + like a white paper ] flower or so.	24
{F Oh, } that sounds delicious.	21
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
yeah.	15
Now, in the summer they have {D like } a lot of field trips.	24
Yeah.	4
I can that, -	26
<Laughter> {F Uh, } {C but } he picked the right songs	9
a Continental has -- -- more trunk space.	24
{F Uh, } no --	33
Absolutely.	36
I think we both agree on that, #  [ [ [ then, + then, ] + then, ] + then ] a [ parent, + # parental ] involvement has to be there.	9
I probably won't finish it until the end of the year --	24
[ in fact, + in fact ]  the Cowboys got the best end of that deal.	9
You live in U-,	29
{C and } we had access to a motor home which is really super great, <laughter> if you don't want to rough it too much.	24
[ it's, + it's ] kind of strange that it's getting as big as it is.	9
It's been about two years now.	24
{D well, } I enjoy hills, in Texas too.	24
Uh, maybe more qualified and, uh, more dedicated to the issues.	9
Boy,	21
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } you can actually see it.	24
It, -	26
{D Well, } I think we unconsciously <throat_clearing> do the same thing.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Where are you calling from by the way, Texas.	38
when they ask you [ if you, + {F uh, } if you  ] want to be on, {D you know, } -	24
{C and then, } {D you know, } now we're just going on  the one income	24
{C and } the, {F uh, } -	26
Right.	15
{C But } I'm not sure if I'll get benefit out of both of them.	24
<Laughter> Oh.	15
to me that was just too much of a hassle to get all geared up and take the time to drive over there, and workout and then drive back <laughter>.	9
[ It's, + it's ] hard topic because -	9
[ I, + I ] believe in the trial by jury.	24
I went where I wanted to go.	24
<Laughter> But not worth it.	2
<Breathing>.	20
All right.	38
Yep.	15
{D Well, } the one I think is interesting is the [ California, + Los Angeles ] police chief who says he won't resign.	11
Yeah.	15
{C and, } of course, the competing itself, really didn't matter what it was,	9
Yeah,	38
{C But, } {F uh, } [ I have just, +   that's just ] not been my thing.	24
[ [ I, + I, ] + I ] guess so.	34
{C because, } {F um, } having been in school, we kind of put things off -- -- and only went in when we knew there was a problem somewhere and stuff	24
It was nice to talk with you, too.	38
{D Well } what kind of cash?	39
Have you ever been down here?	7
Huh-uh.	15
[ I, +  I ] don't really have a favorite,	24
{F Um, } {D you know, } different things, -	26
{C And } [ [ I, + I ] never, + I ]  didn't want to say too much for fear he would think it was wrong and wouldn't do it anymore <laughter>.	24
I think you're right,	36
{C but } it's my first dog I've had	24
Uh-huh.	15
{E I mean, } I go up twice a week to see my grandmother,	24
{C and } they could be fired for that? <<pause>>	8
I thought he would  respect me more than that, to look through my things  and not trust me,	9
I know.	36
Yeah.	15
# It's just as wild as any soap # opera, from what I hear on the news.	9
I'm kind of old fashioned, I guess, that way.	24
{C and } [ we have, + we have ] some more that need to be done,	24
It's like you said, {D you know, } to each his own.	24
{C But } it's just as, -	26
I usually just, -	26
someday, if I were to get remarried I might want to buy a house which requires lots of money which I don't have	24
{F Oh, } really?	12
There has been times they have had to just close off the prisons and leave them in  county jails or whatever because there just wasn't enough room for all of them.	24
{F Um, }   [ that's   on at, + let's see, it's on at ] four.	24
{C and } I just don't feel that <<fade out>> ... -	9
uh, oh, I'm trying to think of the channel.	24
The problem is -	26
yeah	15
Uh-huh.	15
{E I mean } it's hard to find places to go.	24
Right,	36
They don't do that here.	24
{C But, } {F uh, } hopefully, if we ever get our road  system fixed up, this will get a lot better.	24
yeah,	15
We said things like spaghetti <laughter> <<Loud>>. <Laughter> {D You know } things like that.	24
[ I, + it's ]  real contagious	24
{C and, } {F uh, }  [ if, + if ] the child [ is, + is ] pretty straight forward, {F um, } she's fine.	24
one of them is leaving.	24
I'll tell you one thing though [ [ that'll, + that, ] + that ] [ I, + I ] saw that was really nice.	24
right	36
it is a deterrent [ in the, + in the ] sense that that person will never do it again <laughter>.	9
The death penalty.	30
It's not.	9
# Yeah. #	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
# {F Oh, } it # just dies and rolls in.	24
Yeah.	15
{C So, } {F uh, } I, -	26
This is the, -	26
{D Well, } that's good.	21
Uh-huh.	15
course, there are mountains,	24
{C but } we're still fine.	24
that's, -	26
-- {D actually } I have my own business,	24
{F Um. }	26
-- {C but } on the other hand, {F uh, } we get the, {F uh, } affect of [ the, + {F uh, } the  ] city	24
Yeah,	4
{C but } [ I sa-, + I have ] more  ((   ))  with the hardware than I do with the software,	24
{F uh, } I'm pretty diversified, too.	24
[ it's + {D like, } it's ] not too much money,	24
{C and } if they re-, -	26
{F uh, } I think Texas, San Antonio in particular,  has got a large, {F uh, } base of hospitals.	24
[ Was, + was ] the whole face done or just the numbers,  [ and, +  and, }  like minute marks?	7
{C And so } basically that's what I'm looking for in a  used car.  Something that's going to last me at least three years.	24
My wife doesn't necessary like that stuff,	24
-- {C and then } for the Saturday night dinner they  bring in {D like } Kentucky Fried Chicken from Durant,	24
She, she wants to te-, to tell you about her story over again	24
{C And } it, -	26
{C and } he {D like } comes home with something new everyday, # {D you know }	24
{F Oh, } did you?	12
Great,	21
we do have tax on clothes.	24
Uh-huh.	15
-- jeez,	21
Yeah,	15
{C so. }  You're right about that.	36
{C And } they have gone through, {F uh, }  one, two, three, four, five doctors and then a team of doctors,	24
{C and } the smell is really bad they sa-, -	24
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah,	15
Bye.	38
Yeah.	15
{C and  so } then you wind up with little  brats on your hands.	9
It really was,	9
how,	16
maybe you can call them split skirts.	9
I hit a two iron awful lot.	24
{D Well, } {F um, } I work in the computer science center	24
{C and } it's much nicer.	24
{D Well, } I've had them, {F uh, }  where I've served up to twelve to sixteen people.	24
{C But } I think [ the, + the ] average American is probably pretty heavily in debt. [ Not, + not ] including {D like } a mortgage.	9
No,	15
{C But } I think trial by jury [ is, + it's  ] a lot better than leaving it up to one person.	9
# Do you # enjoy cooking?	7
parents always do.	9
I think that gun control has come up because there has been some crazies that killed people with guns	9
My major source of information, I guess, is T V news <throat_clearing>.	24
The question is, {E I mean, } would I want to buy,	24
{C And } they've got entire squadrons of those just standing by.	24
Uh-huh	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah <tapping>.	15
{F Oh, } really.	15
[ I've, + I've ] just never had problems with them.	24
Uh-huh.	15
he didn't look too bad, did he?	7
{D Well, }  [ I, +  I, ] sincerely hope that you don't have that terrible storm we had.	24
I'm sure that true.	9
since we live here and  we all benefit, rich, poor or in between, {F uh, }  {A there are benefits even for those who have it the hardest. }  I just see that as maybe a good idea.	9
[  I, + {F uh, } I ] tell you,	17
I just went to school	24
{C but } after that  [ that's, + ] {D you know, } {F uh } -- -- they didn't want to do it anymore.	9
if you get too much in one spot you can smooth it out.	24
{C and, }  {F uh, } I really don't have any recourse,	24
yeah,	15
I work at a university,	24
Uh-huh.	15
It has, -	26
(( {C and } I'm like, {F um } )) , {C but, } {F uh, }  I haven't seen one  (( yet ))  either	24
{D Well, } what's your views on it?	31
{C but then } he was required to go back and work for a certain number of years in this town at, {F uh, } {F uh, } -	24
To do,	30
{C and } they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them. Because they are actually buying it and shipping it in from outside.	24
# The # guy came in while he was home	24
{F Oh, } # I think it is. #	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but, } I think the employer keeps in mind this will be deducted, {D you know, }	9
{F Uh, } also, slightly off the subject, but [ our, +  our ] big green garbage thing got stolen.	24
{D Well, } that was one of the things I was thinking about in school, {F um, }	24
I'm seriously considering  going back to school for law. # {F Um, } # which is a complete,  I wouldn't say career change, [ it's, + it's ] a (( subway )) ,	24
{F Um, } {D well, } we may have just a couple over here.	11
[ {C and } that, + {C and } that's ] what it falls under.	24
and <breathing>, the financing is always something we consider, you know, the four percent or when they -- -- give good financing through the, the motor company.	24
<Laughter>.	20
That's a cost of doing business.	9
Our first car was an Oldsmobile back in seventy-seven.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Okay,	13
{C But } we never received any merchandise either,	24
{C and } she came up negative.	24
How long was that?	39
{C and, } {F uh, } our son's not as interested in it as our daughter,	24
Yeah.	4
Yeah	15
[ Some-, + {C or } something ] [ like, {F uh, } what's the, + like  ] the Volkswagen Vanagon. I've heard is really nice.	24
{C but } they put out toxic chemicals there just in some of [ the, + ] {F um, } what they do, {F uh, } to, {F uh, } make their dough  and [ st-, + ] to, clean out the flour and stuff like that,	24
that was pretty good.	24
Uh-huh.	15
-- {C and } I can understand them wanting to have them,	24
{C so, } [ It, + it's ] really neat.	13
is that what that?	7
[ it's,  +   {C an } it's ] supposedly real reliable	24
{F Oh, } really?	12
{C so. } -	26
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } all the little bitty things that I didn't even know	24
I'd like to see a law enforcement agency, not N R A,	24
Let's see, what did we have the last time we had guests over.	1
# Yeah.  #	15
okay,	15
{C And then } you never feel  {D like } you've got anything [ to p-, +  to put ] into savings or anything,	9
They need exposure to every subject.	9
Okay.	29
My dad does it all for me <laughter>.	24
{C And, }  {F uh, } -	26
my grandparents came over during  the time when, {F uh, } there were quotas.	24
{C and, } {F um, } they just don't think the same way we do.	9
Course, [ my, + my ] favorite now [ is, + is ] DANCES WITH WOLVES.	24
# {D Now, } [ they # just, + {F uh, } they've ] already put through the health bill <clicking>.	11
{F Oh, } we watch, {D like } for example, {F uh, } -	24
{D Well, } it was nice talking to you.	38
{C and } they were all the basketball players there to play the Cavaliers --	24
{C and, } {D you know, } [ we'd, + he'd ] fly down there on Mondays and fly back on Fridays,	24
{C But } if someone would come to get them, {D you know, } they're allowed to leave with them,	24
{C because } I think [ yu-, + {D you know, } you ] grow closer.	9
Right,	36
{D you know, } the parents kind of pushed them to join, {D like } the Boy Scouts <children> or Girl Scouts	9
{F Huh. }	15
Uh-huh.	15
Right,	36
# Right.  #	15
{C so } <laughter>, -	26
[ I have, + {F um, } I have  ] three kids --	24
thank you,	38
because there are so many of them that  the next one to come up, if you just knock one off and then have another one,	9
Yeah.	15
{D So, } -	26
He [ bought, + {F uh, } bought ] a big horse farm out in a little town called Roanoke, Texas.	24
{F Oh, } gee	21
{C But } you're probably, [ what, + ] about halfway across the state from San Antonio, though, aren't you?	7
Uh-huh,	15
{F Uh, } I don't. Because, {F uh, } I come from  [ a lot, + a bigger ] city than this one	24
so I had to mail order the part, uh,	24
I'm trying to get out.	24
That makes sense.	9
[ it's, + it's ] fun  [ to, +  to ] do that.  {F Uh, }	9
we've got some   children	24
[ stay, + stay ] in line for, {F uh, } four hours to get an aspirin from a doctor.	24
{F Oh, } no.	21
Uh-huh.	15
I have quite a bit of problem down here with the squash bugs, and haven't figured out how to get rid of those yet.	24
I think they did a real good job of that.	9
I type up the tapes of what people talked about.	24
they're, {F um, } things even just starting around the home. # {D You # know }	9
[ That's always, + that's always ] a concern, but just a nice quiet easy place -- -- maybe candlelight something -- -- just to relax, {D you know } -- -- because I don't really go out to dinner  that much,	24
# {C and } #  right,	26
{F Uh, } {C and }  I don't know that, {F uh, } a lot of people vote in primaries for that very reason.	9
situations like that, you don't realize,  {D you know, } until you start thinking about it,  the kinds of  ((   ))  advantages you school may have over others.	9
No,	36
<Laughter>.	20
my only major objection is that, uh, I don't think American media spends enough, uh, attention on, on our closest neighbors like Mexico and Canada.	9
<Laughter>.	20
Wow.	21
[ I bought me, + {F oh, } I guess,  I just went and bought me ] just about nineteen dollars worth of little [ bu-, +  buds, ] [ planted, + {F uh, } already grown. ]	24
{C And } how they can do it I have no idea.	24
Okay,	15
# Right. #	15
Exactly.	36
Uh-huh.	15
I had very flexible hours.	24
{D Well, } [ I, + I ] really choose restaurants more for the quality of food than anything else.	24
{D Like } [  I, + I ] think going two six weeks {C and  then } having two, two weeks off, each after a two six weeks period is one way.	24
{C But } [ it's, + it is ] very nice.	24
{F Oh, } okay.	29
{C and } they don't finds anything out about the facts that he's done this over and over and over again --	24
The only other thing they asked me is what I would expect in pay.	24
Right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
What do you think?	31
Oh.	15
[ It's, + it's ] real easy,	24
{C And then } they have another one the same  size.	24
We wound up selling the house.	24
Yeah.	4
[ I, + I, ] noticed that when I was a kid, {F uh, } -	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C so } [ it's, + it ] gets pretty, -	26
Right.	11
{F Oh, } I do, too.	36
{C But, } {E I mean, } cucumbers here grow like crazy.	24
[ {C and, } +  {C and } ] I like to just add picante sauce to get the Mexican flavor	24
{D you know, } starting to learn the colors [ and, + and ] learning to associate with children -- -- so that when he went to, {D you know, } school -- -- and stuff, -	24
Right.	15
I don't know what the answer is.	24
we have a three bedroom house.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Who it really penalizes is their insurance company which then translates into higher rates for all of us. If they get some of those mega awards against them.	24
it's in the north end of Oak Cliff in, {F uh, } Kessler Park area,	24
They're a bunch of animals, {D you know. }	25
{C but } I wasn't in trouble every time I got down the fairway.	24
{D Well, } I know [ they say +  like with Reagan,  they say ] no new taxes,	9
{C but } obviously you're experiencing it.  {F Uh, }	24
[ [ {C but } I, + {C but } I don't, ] + {C but } I know ] it's on a -	26
{F Uh, } {D well, } from what I've seen, -	24
{C But, } I'm in Plano.	25
yeah,	36
{E I mean, } for a while, sometimes they  come in a whole bunch of them that just,  {A I don't even, } {D you know } -- -- doesn't even sound like something I want to see.	24
{C And } they would have dinner	24
<laughter> I don't know,	19
# Yeah.  #	15
{D Well, } he likes it all right.	24
Yeah,	4
Uh-huh.	15
#  (( I like it )) . #	24
{D well } they actually have an electric minivan.	24
[ I would, +   [ if you, + if I ] ] want to say don't have power or don't have authority or whatever -- -- like I used to be in that research --	24
Sort of rent-a-mom,	24
That's an interesting point.	9
Okay,	13
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } #  (( wow )) . #	21
# Uh-huh,	15
Now they're starting to recycle that stuff.	24
they're pretty tough, {F uh, }	9
Yeah.  We'd like to. *[[should be two slash units]]	11
they're thick.	22
It gets kind of boring.	9
That's right,	36
{C and } I won't know what I'm doing,	24
<Laughter> That's exactly what I did.	24
here the, -	26
{C and } he read the bar code that was on the side of the tub.	24
[ that, + that's ] too bad.	21
he just pitched his first, {F uh, }  exhibition game a day or so ago,	24
{C and then } we could talk a bit about, {F um, } just quality of products in general, # if # [ y-, + they're ] better or worse like if they last longer or something like that.	37
{D so, } okay,	26
Yeah,	15
Yes, sir.	26
{C or } do you watch, on T V?	35
Probably [ not, + not  ] as bad as Detroit.	9
right.	15
{F Oh, } yeah?	12
{C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } I saw it there, too,	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
Okay,	15
Yeah,	4
Yes, <breathing>	36
#Sounds like you,# you need at least like a Taurus size, or something like that.	22
That's great.	21
That's great.	21
I usually ended snagging my,  {F uh, } fishing partners or <laughter> the trees along the bank <laughter>.	24
# It  ((   ))  thing # actually. -	26
# [ It, + it's ] # nice when it makes, a lot because you can feed your own family	24
{D Well, } if he's pleased with it,  I guess that's, {F uh, } the bottom line.	9
{C but, } -	26
{F Uh, } {C and } [ I, +  I ] recycle aluminum, glass, {F uh, } newspapers.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Schroeder's about the biggest one in Washington.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C but, } {F uh, } -	26
{C But } the most important thing was that, {F uh, } they had made up the difference between, {F uh, } unemployment pay and seventy-five percent of my net pay.	24
{D Well, } [ I wouldn't think th-, + I would really say ]  that that's not true, because {F uh, } it seems like certain newspapers  always espouse certain candidates,	9
[ It's, + this is ] the way it's going to be.	25
{E I mean }  [ [ [ they, +  they, ] +  they ] are  s-, +   it is a select, ] college.	9
Yeah, {F oh, }	15
uh-huh.	4
{C and, } -	26
Yeah.	15
<Laughter> Yeah.	4
[ I haven't, + my husband had ] been in there several times	24
{C but } it's not, -	26
I loved it.	24
You like the Chrysler products, do you?	7
{C or } I'll, -	26
[ Do you have, + do you have ] a rotor tiller?	7
{C so } I know it sounds like a rationalization	24
-- {C and, }  {F uh, } I was standing in water  not more than, [ in + barely above ] my ankles --	24
Okay, {F uh, }	29
-- it's not that big of a problem.	9
# {F Oh, } for heaven's sake. #	21
{C so, } # # Yeah. #	13
{F Uh, } in fact, tonight I had the dinner with, {F uh, } my three brothers and our wives	24
{D well, }    [ [ I'd, +   I, ] +  {D now } I ] have a problem with this, too.	24
[ {C But } it's not, + {C but } it's not ]  set up as a giveaway.	24
{C But, } {F uh, } {D you know, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] don't know.  It's just [ kind of a, + kind of a ] delicate subject I guess.	13
{C and } [ I + I ] do exercise on a regular basis.	24
[ it, + it ]  was pretty good,	9
Yeah,	15
{C but } [ it's still, + it's still ] not that private.	9
{F Oh, } my.	21
Yeah.	4
I'm the same way you are,	9
[ [ [ If I, + if see a, ] + s-, ] + if I see ] a pile of  cans or bottles or something -- -- I'll throw it in there <laughter>,	24
Yeah,	36
{E I mean, }  what's the other one, {F uh, } # C B S. #	16
one is two	24
Wow.	21
{C Because } I got up and started jumping on it again.	24
I keep thinking  when the kids get bigger and I have a little more time, {F uh, } [ I might take up, + ]  [ there is, + ] I would love to cross-stitch.	24
The victim has been victimized twice,  not only by the perpetrator of the crime but also, the courts that try to do the justice.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I appreciate your having called.	38
Oh, yeah.	15
{C and } I don't think the people here two hundred years ago were that different,	9
Oh.	15
# Yeah. #	15
{F Oh } really?	12
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh } wow,	21
{C and then } [ I had, + {D well,  } {D you know, } I'd ] eat -	26
{F Huh. }  {D Well } I'm just thanking heaven.	24
Hey, how you doing?	6
[ I've + {D actually } I've ] driven,	24
Yeah,	26
# <Throat_clearing>. #	20
#  ((   )) . # -	20
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, }  not that I am #	24
{F Um. }	15
I don't even know --	34
like I said, we, -	26
{F Oh, } wow.	21
the hand's about  the size of a cricket. And, {F uh, } has, {F uh, } {D like } the forefinger sticking out and the thumb sticking out,	24
[ I've, + I've, ] haven't tried to upgrade myself right now,	24
{C And } they were  simple too,	9
It's, looks like -- -- easy pickings	9
[ I, + ] in some ways, it's almost worse than murder.	9
{C So } I think that's real good.	9
Yeah.	15
{C And, } {F uh, } it's a very interesting book.	24
I do have a few friends that live in my apartment complex in this neighborhood,	24
Not so much.	5
the man always did the bills for, I don't know, fifteen years or more,	24
I can't think of any examples <baby_crying>	24
For how many years?	39
I just might do that.	24
{F oh, } what's that called,	1
And the same to you.	24
{D Well, } what do you think it is?	39
{C And, } {F uh, } <laughter> then I guess there's still the possibility that, {F uh, } hostilities with, {F uh, } U S troops could still break out.	9
{D Well, } that's good.	21
[ I, + I ] wonder if they should give them a test, or at least [ maybe not take their licen-, + maybe give them ] a refresher driving course, [ and + ] just to see how well they are every five years.	9
True.	36
# I # just don't care for that.	24
He was a little surprised.	24
[ [ He, + he has, ] + he's ] recently retired	24
Uh-huh,	15
-- [ I, +  {D you know, } # I'm ] not # -- -- for it.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } yeah,	4
Yeah,	15
{D Well, } [ I, + I  ] think it's a pretty good idea.	9
{D Well, } [ Charles will actually, +   Charles will ] not smoke in anyone else's house except our own.	24
{C And then } when you're ready to serve them then you cook the sauce and  then put the meatballs into the sauce  And heat it	18
Bye-bye.	38
I would think so.	24
drop in at times that are unexpected.	18
<Laughter>  We, finally got a little respect.	24
{C but, } {D you know, } having this dog -	26
I used to.	24
gosh, -	21
Yeah.	15
My wife and I, {D you know, } as mentioned, -	24
No,	36
[ I, + I ] don't know if it's that serious, [ i-, + ]	24
{D you know } -- -- I'm no longer a teenager in high school.	24
{C But } -	26
It is over with.	8
They can keep their eyes open,	2
Okay.	29
{D You know, } {C and so, } -	26
I like to have a little there, {D you know, }	24
{C so } [ they, + {D you know, } the only way they ] know their  grandparents is by pictures.	24
Yeah,	36
Yeah.	15
{C and } we just died.	24
<Sniffing>.	20
{F Oh, } we have one.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } -	26
{C so } [ it's, + it's  ] really quite pretty.	9
Right.	15
Sure.	15
That's life,	13
Right.	15
not that I want everything to halt	24
{C but } [ it's, + {F um, } it's, ] {F uh, } -	26
[ ex-, + exactly, ] {C and so, } my husband says, {D Well, } that's fine, {D you know, }	24
{F Uh, } I grew up in New York	24
the overmilitarization of Iraq was due to companies selling them arms and things,	24
They had them all on hold --	24
{C but } [ it, + it ] seems nice enough.	9
{C and } this one's got houses on either side and, {D you know, } real close together,	24
Uh-huh.	15
let me think here.	17
# <Laughter>. #	20
[ They had, +  he had ]  gotten it from the pound	24
That's true.	36
{C but } I wouldn't, -	24
I thought, {D Christ, }  they're # letting me in, # -- -- to, {D you know, } -	24
And, {D well, } {D you know, } the auto budget,	24
{C And } I think though that we need to have some liquid around that you don't have to go through the company to get <laughter>.	9
{C So } we started collecting them,	24
Have you, # too? #	7
