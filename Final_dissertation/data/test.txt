I love it,	11
{D Well, } that's a good idea.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Yes.	4
they tried to keep it, {D you know, } as very close to real.	9
it's like that  (( good ))  for us just  because my uncle [ and my, + and my ] mom switch off like we have her for three months	24
Uh-huh,	15
Right.	15
I am.	24
# <Laughter>.  #	20
[ {C and, } +  {C and } ] I grew up in California.	24
{D Well, } we, {F uh, } -	26
You need -- -- to have twenty-four hour care -- -- {F uh, } answering all the needs cause they can't do much for themselves at certain points.	9
it's an older van	24
I used to, {F uh, }	24
I think I heard somebody talking about that she cuts his foot off or  something, {D you know. }	9
(( {D see } )) , I like it that way though.	24
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ]  {F uh, } [ I, + I'm ] just going to keep holding off	24
Okay.	13
Yeah,	36
it was far extreme, thought we'd never find the place.	24
{C and } I'm not feeling invaded then maybe my privacy hasn't been because I have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded.	9
{D Well, } {F uh, } space is a handicap with me,	24
I got out of the habit of listening to the radio,	24
I don't know -- -- if you seen this.	8
{E I mean, } -	26
<Laughter>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
{D well } it's gotten so big it's almost a town in it's own right.	9
{F Uh, } go ahead,	18
# Right.  #	15
{D So } do you like romantic music?	7
{F Um, } what else considering beside family, economics, {F um, } -	1
Sure.	15
I didn't think you could,	8
# {C And } that's, -	26
So many people will immigrate here [ in the twentieth, + at the year two thousand, ]	9
{C And, }  {F uh, }  that's the unfair [ equity, + inequities ] of sales tax as a main source of  revenue,	9
{C And } we talked, {F uh, } about some length,	24
Yeah,	36
[ I, + I, ] -	26
{C but, } {F um, } I, -	26
Yeah.	15
{C and } you're out, {D you know. }	25
Okay.	29
{C and, } {F um, } {D you know, } I've always come out aces.	24
Yeah.	15
He would love it if I would go out and play with him,	24
an <laughter>, -	26
I see.	38
do [ you, + you ] think San Antonio is more comfortable than Dallas.	7
I had a dump truck come and dump it.	24
That's an example of something you can't do gradually.	24
Okay.	38
{F oh, } really?	12
{C And } we're -	26
{C and, } {D you know, } I think they even have a swimming pool --	9
I guess I better go <laughter>.	38
Here in Texas it's a real mess right now.	24
{C but, } they grow wild here,	24
[ My, + my ] children all ski --	24
Did he take that back to California with him?	16
Yeah,	15
That's right.	36
{C so } <laughter>. That's my one night out and about,	24
{C but } to have the expense of, -	26
[ I had, + I had  ] a granddaughter <laughter>.	24
{C and, } {F uh, } they're hard to get around in traffic to see.	24
<<Very faint>> <throat_clearing>.	20
Yeah,	30
They target their efforts toward the citizens -- -- not the criminals.	9
<Noise> {D Well, } we did a, {F uh, } -	24
yeah.	26
Yeah.	36
that's okay.	27
It's one we all hold dear and near, I'm sure.	9
Yeah,	36
right?	23
{C But, } {F uh, } there are several things that, -	26
it was a lot easier [ when I was, + when I was ] single,	24
What about yard space?	31
it's not.	9
Uh-huh.	15
In our parking lots, {F uh, } two or three days ago I saw one of the new Honda sports cars.	24
{C But, } I know there are a lot of things that can influence them	24
{C But } [ you shouldn't, +  what's the old saying, you shouldn't ] judge a book by its cover.	9
yeah.	15
{F Oh, } {D well, } that's nice.	21
uh-huh.	36
{C And } the thing that they forgot to do was [ to, +  {F um, }  to ] also look at the hose,	24
[  It's, + it's ] a competitiveness against yourself.	9
I have three children	24
Right.	15
{F Oh, } really.	12
would that we could <laughter>.	9
It's really a shame.	9
{D Well, } are our five minutes up?  <Laughter>.	38
{C But } that's one good thing	9
{F Um. }	15
{C But }  I couldn't,	24
Then they should be  ((   )) -	24
Uh-huh.	15
# That's real rough.  #	21
That's okay <laughter>.	27
{C and } we're going, {F Oh, } my gosh.	24
I am sure I pass by it or something,	24
# Yeah. #	15
I think the kids, when we were on vacation, they said they did take them to [ a, + a ] recycling place, probably at one of the li-, -	24
Yeah,	4
{F Oh, } okay.	29
It's always about some guy losing some girl and then, {D you know, }  playing the guitar and singing about it.	9
{D Well, } those things must take up a huge  amount of space in landfills.	9
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } [ it was something, + {F uh, } it was basically ] the essence was does the crime fit the punishment	24
Right.	15
{C so. }  Anyway.   I don't know if our five minutes are over yet <laughter>.	24
{C Or } if it gets stolen or if you lose it or  whatever it might be --	22
<Sniffing>.	20
{D Now } they may be through with them now.	24
Do you?	12
<Sniffing>  # You're brave <laughter>. #	9
{D Well, } {D Well, } now when I first moved to Dallas, I moved up  here by myself	24
{C and } you can put mushrooms in if you want,	24
it's, {F uh } -- -	26
you would think, -	9
{C and } they come, go to church with us	24
yeah,	15
{C and, } {D you know, } they get together with a bunch of guys	9
[ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {D you know, } {C so } ]  he's very much due for a good year.	9
I don't, -	26
October.	24
Foreign aid means to go down to almost zero unless it's absolutely -- -- necessary.	9
{C And } I really know what the budget is,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	4
Uh-huh.	15
It had a social message to it	24
I live in a real small little place.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C But, } -	26
Yeah.	15
{C And, } {F uh, } it's staggering.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C and, } this is a rear wheel drive model.	24
we [ built, + put ] a kitchen in and, {F um, } that kind of stuff, and painting and some wallpapering,	24
{F Oh, } uh-huh.	15
I know.	36
I can't remember who it was,	24
knowing from what my daughter has gone through, [ she's, + she ] learned a lot	24
Okay.	29
{C but } it's a lot to put into one.	9
Yeah.	15
Okay.	29
Uh-huh.	15
The manager.	2
{C and } my mother used to knit, {D you know, } # all # the time	24
{C but } not, -	26
[ I think, + I think ] if they put it into force more often, they wouldn't have as many problems as they've got.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	36
no.	33
{C And } I think  that T I is latched themselves up with an established group.	24
That really is a nice area.	24
a friend gave me a recipe that I really {D like } for chicken enchiladas.	24
And then make movies out of some of them.	24
currently we have a poodle.	24
Is this your first time?	7
{C But } I have got a four month old baby,	24
{F Huh. }	15
Huh <<very faintly>>.	15
{D Now } [ it's, +  {F um, } is it ] very wooded around  where you are,	7
{C So, } {F uh, } -	26
{C and } I am at school at seven thirty.	24
Okay.	29
Yeah.	15
{C And } he [ fixed some, + fixes some ] bowls that have the cracks or chips in them, and, {F uh, } molds that in.	24
# {F Huh. } #	26
{C but } {D like } this tiles come loose off the wall,	24
you don't have to be, -	24
{C and, } {F uh, }  I've been playing, {D you know, } off and on when I can.	24
Yeah,	4
Right.	15
Yeah.	15
{C but, } I used to watch all those exercise programs  on T V,	24
{C But, } {F um, } {D you know, } I don't know.	19
right.	15
{D Well } <throat_clearing>, [ I use, + {F uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, }  I have used, ] {F uh, } several techniques depending on what, -	24
Yeah,	36
[ in, + in ] Texas.	22
do you think that's good -- -- {D you know, } like if a jury, -	7
Uh-huh.	15
# if # they say which, -	26
{D Well, } some, I'm just wondering  a lot of times they will put, {F uh, } people, lesser crimes in, {F uh, } with,  {F uh, } people that did more severe crimes	9
Uh-huh.	15
It was,	24
{D Well. }	26
Right,	15
Uh-huh.	15
they are probably going to miss the  person	9
{C and } [ we've got, + we've got  ] to go into partnership with the Japanese to build cars.	9
Thank you.	38
Yeah.	15
you don't have to do as much [ as, + as  ] I thought.	3
Oh.	15
that [ helped me, + helped ] motivate me <laughter>.	24
{C But } {D see, } I don't see a lot of T I advertisements on T V anyway.	24
it is in America where it was hard	24
here in, -	26
{C and } that would screw up all the chemical cycles again --	24
I do worry about medical, though.	24
I enjoy it a lot.	24
{C but } [ I, + {F uh, } I ] basically never charge anything I don't have the money in the bank to pay for.	24
[ I, + I ] have no idea.	24
Uh-huh,	15
Really.	15
Wow.	21
-- {C and, } {E I mean, } when I see the amount of clothes that they buy [ and, + and  ] how much it costs them to buy fast food on the way home -- -- I'm sure that they're not [ making + quote making  ] money for the family on this --	24
Yeah.	30
{C and } [ our, + # our ] baby # girl just had a baby girl <laughter>.	24
to go.   *[[slash error]] {C But, } -  *[[%]]	9
[ I haven't, + I didn't ] go down there last year,	24
Right.	15
What they're trying to do there is, they want to sort of get a base line measure for you, {D you know. }	24
It's just my husband and I, too --	24
and then, uh, our, our newer car is a, uh, a Corsica.	24
unfortunately I haven't,	24
I think there's probably things I could think of short of murder that [ someone, + I think someone ] would probably deserve to be killed for.	9
-- {C but, } {F uh, } [ I'm, +  {F uh, } I'm ]  pretty much out to the things to say.	24
{C So, } -	26
right,	15
they'd take anything I think <laughter>,	24
{C but } I used to  really like the looks of the M P V because it looks more like a mini van rather than I think, -	24
# If not, he gets # beat to death like poor old Troy Aikman has the last couple of years anyway,	9
yes.	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I just write down [ e-, +  all ] my bills,  how much I'm going to have to pay	24
# And said, #  {D well, } we'll cancel it  just like they did to [ the, + ] that Polish debt here, {F uh, } last week.	24
We just -- -- bought, uh, a car, uh, last year and then bought one in eighty-nine --	24
the history of our country has been inches	9
The population is afraid to speak  out against him	9
{D Well. } -	26
Okay.	29
We know what we can do <laughter>.	9
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] the cat kind of rules,	24
{C But } only thing I'm concerned about is  potential for injury to your knees -- -- {D you know, } [ that +  and movement of going  up on the step -- -- {D you know, } that ] could create a problem.	9
# Right.  #	15
{C but } because I sort of stick to several schools, {F uh, } I'm usually aware that there might be a spirit week going on [ and, + and ] might, might remember to do it.	24
<laughter> they've been stored so long.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } I kind of have always pooh-poohed  military educations.	24
Yeah.	36
{C and } you wonder, {D you know, } # where's it all going # --	9
got a kid that just a question of maturity,	24
Right.	15
Do they?	7
yeah,	36
{F Um. }	26
I'm making T shirts and sweat shirts.	24
{E I mean, }  by the times it transforms into Wave by mark off model	25
<Laughter>.	20
I think  it's very good for the child.	9
{D Well, } I'm from New Mexico	24
[ I <laughter> kind of, + I ] think so, too.	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } they had, -	26
Right.	15
I got a Toyota Four Runner.	24
# Yeah,	15
{F Uh, } {E I mean, } I was in the same  boat when I left high school.	24
That kind of was, {F um, } kind of a pop psychology time for [ wh-, + when ] a lot of books like that were coming out, I think.	9
You haven't?	12
that's pretty out there.	21
No,	33
Yeah.	15
Yeah	15
{C and } I find that I can often, {D you know, } -	24
{C and, }  {F uh, } my mom didn't work at all when I was growing up.	24
Right.	36
[ [ I, + I, ] + # I've ] seen # the signs	24
(( {C And } there's ))  a lot of those  ((   )) (( Blair ))  shows floating around.	9
{C and } I remember one time watching one of the, {F uh, } schizophrenic patients actually go out on, {A I don't know what they call it, } a binge or whatever you want to say it --	24
Thank you much.	38
{C and, }  {F uh, } if you treat them right, they're not the gas guzzlers I think that they've got the reputation to be.	9
it is.	24
Uh-huh.	15
my husband does too.	24
Yeah,	36
{C and } it evokes an emotional response.	9
Okay,	15
{C and, } {F uh, } we would like industry to do more before they build these big, huge incinerators.	24
{F Uh, } I think so.	11
that's the thing about baking.	9
Right,	36
No,	36
I'm a junior in college now.	24
Especially if you're an inner city, {D you know, } you can't really  feel {D like } you're putting much of a dent in what's going on.	9
{C and, } -	26
# [  That, +  # that's ] my only thing with him.	24
Yeah.	15
[ I was, + I was, ] -	26
Uh-huh.	4
Anyway, -	26
{C But } I thought,  [ it, + it, ] -	24
Right.	36
{C and } {F uh, } [ he's, + {F uh, } he's ] really spoiled, though  <laughter>.	24
{C and } we've lived up north for a while in Chicago  and over in Tennessee.	24
{C but, } -	26
{F Oh, } yeah,	15
I think [ that's, +  {F uh, } there's ] something seriously wrong,	9
{F Huh. }	14
Uh-huh.	15
<Laughter>  Yeah.	15
you'll have much better luck if you had one of these little blenders.	24
{C but } we do have, -	26
# Sure.  #	21
That's interesting.	21
Yeah,	15
# Yeah,	36
Have you had yours now?	7
Uh-huh.	4
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } [ it's, + it's ] informative.	9
It was like a FATAL ATTRACTION thing.	24
Yeah.	15
{F Um. }	15
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } of course.	36
{C or, } -	26
Now we have, {D you know, } at times, made payments -- -- <Laughter> on our things,	24
{C but } he was lucky he got out of it for some reason.	24
<Laughter> {D Well, } you never have enough room do you think. Especially if your into any hobbies or anything.	9
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } there is a lake not far	3
I haven't been back there in years.	24
Yeah,	36
[ it's, + {F uh, } I ] find that interesting.	9
{F Oh, } I bet.	21
{C and now }  that I live in Florida, -	24
I know.	21
we -- -- never did that.	24
I always thought it had to be unanimous.	9
# I do, too.	36
Yeah,	15
[ What's a, + what's a ] one bedroom, -	39
My husband and I met in graduate school, at Indiana University	24
Yeah.	15
Yes,	36
# I never # knew very much at all	24
Mine were -- -- # good, #	24
That's good.	21
{C And, } {F uh, } {F uh, } yes,	36
I thought maybe you lived in Dallas, because that's the complaint I make to my husband about the radio station too.	24
Okay.	13
I know it.	36
{F Oh, } definitely.	11
{D Well, } you will get to different levels.	9
{C and, } {F uh. } -	26
{C so } it would be interesting to watch.	9
{D So } do you go to school in Provo, Utah?	7
I guess I keep that one part of me that's like, -	9
You first.	18
There's a big variation  among the country,	9
{F Uh, } {D well, } I think all college players have to do an initial drug test at a certain point prior to the season --	24
{D Well, } do you live, [ [ you, + you ] + ] in a house, or a  place where you, {F uh, } -	7
Program.	2
(( Yeah,	36
{C but } I enjoy the news.	24
uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Every family has all that going on,	9
it runs first down	24
# {F Uh. }  #	26
{D Well. } -	26
Right.	15
You know,	26
Uh-huh.	15
-- that's where [ my fam-, +  my in-laws ] are.	24
Oh.	15
{D well, } [ I, + I've ]  always thought I'd like to.	24
-- {C but } I still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way [ to, + to ] punish, especially criminals who seem to have absolutely no remorse for what they've done.	24
{C but, } {F uh, } {D well, } have you seen any movies recently?	24
she got well,	24
Uh-huh.	15
I would like to learn that someday,	24
I wish they'd just deliver stuff.	24
[ We're, + we're ] pretty comfortable with that.	24
# {F Uh, } #	15
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] [ one, + one ] week it just rained, thunderstormed for a day straight	24
{C but } I've always been a G M man.	24
{F Oh, } yeah,	36
Real good.	2
{D well, } that's true in [ any, + any  ] company, I think.	9
Yeah.	36
the Lions are pretty good, {A I'm afraid, } [ they pro-, + ] a lot better team than the Cowboys  were today.	9
{D Well, } I've got a friend that says that is just wonderful show.	24
Yes,	38
yeah.	15
yeah,	15
{D Well, } the thing is, [ with, + with ] T V, [ I, + I, ] {F uh, } -	24
{D Well, } I, {F uh, } don't seem to have as  much spare time as I used to,	24
{F Uh, } I rented an I B M Selectric.	24
{D You know. }	7
{D Well, } I know	36
right.	15
if not the biggest yard, I've got pretty close to it, # in # the entire neighborhood.	24
{D So, } What kind of experience [ do you, + do you ] have, then with child care?	39
[ I did, + [ I, + I ] was ] in the same sort of situation as, -	24
Right,	36
{F Um, } {F oh, } I had a thought just a second ago	24
<sniffing>.	20
{D Well, } they've, -	26
{F Oh, } # like everything else. #	22
a little more flexibility.	22
that's, -	26
{F Oh, } hey, that sounds, -	26
{F Oh, } {C and } [ it was, + it was ] something else.	24
{C and } <sigh>, -	26
{F Oh, } really.	15
normally, {E I mean } he didn't seem to have a problem with getting wet,	24
{C and, }  {F uh, } if they say, Hey, you can't do this work, I'd say, Hey, I agree,  [ I don't, + I won't ] do that.	24
How does that, {F uh, } -	39
[ I, + I ] should imagine  that, that would be to keep it at  [ a level, + those levels,  ] I guess, [ that, + that ] were originally appropriated  [ [ w-, +  was ] + ] when the Soviet threat, I guess, was perceived as being a greater one.	24
{C and } he's really the only one that I know of personally who got himself really messed up, {F um, } [ ha-, + having ] been involved with drugs.	24
[ I, + I  ] don't feel like they're a benefit to society in any way,	9
Yeah,	36
No.	33
It's B, A, R, G, E, double L, O <<spells out the word>>	24
I miss, {F uh } -- -- insurance and -- -- {F uh, } the steady paychecks that come.	24
{C and } having gone, {F uh, } -	26
Yeah.	4
{C but } I don't know what it is.	24
[ {C and, } + {C and } ]  I kept pushing her towards just kind of U T or a larger school,	24
[ That, + that's ] the problem.	21
Yeah,	15
# Rather than # -- -- anticipating.	22
Yeah.	15
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah,	15
Yeah.	15
Sure,	11
{D Well, } [ I think that's, + I think that's, ] {F uh, } true.	36
there's, -	26
# Oh. #	15
My problem is not having enough time to do the job as completely and as thoroughly as I would like.	24
there's a variety,	24
Probably.	9
{F um } --	26
In a new house everything is white.	24
{C or, } -	26
{C and } I'll mention  [ someone's, + ] some talk host	24
{C But, }  {F uh, } I guess it's a price you pay.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } I think we're narrowing it down, {D actually. }	24
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] I basically, {F um, } [ I + ]  had a horrible slice or hook,	24
{C and } with age comes, # {D you know, } -	9
Yes,	4
We've progressed a little bit farther than that.	24
[ I only get, + {D well, } I guess I got ] -	26
{F Huh. }	15
{C And, }  a lot of times, what I wind up doing is, picking say an actor or an actress, # and # seeing {D like } all, -	24
Great.	21
he's,	26
Remember all we're doing is delivering pizzas to each other.	9
Yeah.	15
# Uh-huh. #	15
<inhaling> {D So, } -	26
{C and } [ it's just, + it's just ] an eyesore, I think, # with # all the, -	24
Right <laughter>.	15
That would be terribly embarrassing -- -- for someone to really come back positive	9
<laughter>.	20
{C and } on the cover of TIME magazine, there is a girl, she is in Boston?	24
Those are nice,	21
{C and } {D like } Glen Bell plays.	24
Uh-huh.	36
You know what,	13
[ That, + that ] must be a fairly recent release.	22
That is what they call them down here.	24
# {C But } I  ((   )) -	26
Doing it <talking>. -	21
Uh-huh.	15
{C And then, } is it your quadriceps that are the worst?	7
{C because } -- -- if you take it into a service station, they want to charge you forty dollars just  for, {F uh, } freon, which only costs you about three dollars --	9
{C and then } they start a drug problem.	24
{F Oh, }	15
{C and } when we first lived here, [ we l-, + ] we were in Garland, East Richardson, and, {F um, } doesn't seem like it was quite as humid.	24
{C and } they, {D you know, } had done such a good job.	24
{F Oh, } okay.	15
I think, -	26
Yeah,	36
that -	26
{F Oh, } {F oh } that's great,	21
Underwater acoustics.	24
{D So, } -	26
{C and, } {D you know, } then you look at how well they're managed, {D you know, }	24
[ I'm, +  I'm ] worried about them.	24
No,	33
Uh-huh.	15
Do they even understand what's being said?	7
I only took lessons for golf when I was in college.	24
{C But, } {F uh, } I get, -	26
{C and } we'd look for about what you're looking for.	24
he thinks that's what he'd like to do,	24
<Laughter>.	20
I am a converted Catholic,	24
There are [ many, + many ] houses [ ju-, + for sale just ] by the regular route.	9
{F Uh, } really, really good.	9
<Throat_clearing>.	20
That's right.	36
{F Oh, }  {D well, } {D actually, }  [ I would, +  {D you know } what I would ] love?	1
are you familiar with the International Baccalaureate program.	7
{C and } I took her [ to the, + {F uh, } to the ] vet's because she wasn't eating [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } she wasn't able to jump.	24
Oh.	15
my old T V that I had from college when we got married finally went out	24
{C and } his brother has an  ((   )) -	24
<Laughter> Right <laughter>.	15
{C but } then there's a lot of good things you don't hear.	9
{C but } it's kind of hard.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I lived in Detroit, too.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } -- -- {F uh, } things just come up	24
{D Well, } [ you are, + you are ]  well versed on the subject, I tell you.	9
It's interesting that you said that.	24
Yeah.	4
# uh-huh. #	15
[ [ It, + # #  It's, ] + it's ] religious # based	9
You bet.	36
{D Well, } right at the present time  nothing real special.	24
{F Oh } really?	12
basically I do, too.	24
Wow.	21
We have a tent.	24
--  ((   )) , it could have been,  {D you know, } -	9
Yes.	36
On A B C?	7
{C But, }  {F uh, } sure enjoyed it.	24
Excuse me one second.	18
{D Well, } I think [ the, + the ] more people are aware of it, [ the, + the ] more they'll do.	9
especially [ that defense, + cuts in the defense ] is really a Catch twenty-two -- -- double whammy, because like you say, if you cut defense, {D well, } that's great,	9
Uh-huh.	15
I'm certainly driven by the desire to maintain my weight and be healthy and be in shape,	24
{C and }  they were sort of the lower end of the top of the line, hotels, because they said you can't stay in the cheap stuff.	24
{F Oh, } {C and } I get it all in my hair, too.	24
{C So, } -	26
they would just fall down.	24
{C and } I don't know when the other ones have their project going and when they want to pick up down my street for things.	24
Oh!	15
Those I can understand.	24
{C but, }  {F um, } {F oh, } I just laughed and cried	24
Sure.	15
{E I mean, }  I always thought my mom was being mean to me	24
we have [ our, + ] a television connected to a, {F uh, } {F uh, } electronic alarm, {F uh, } system that kicks in,	24
{C and } I think it would last me probably  another fifty or sixty thousand miles.	24
{D Well } I'll tell you.	17
No.	33
I think they have a bond with [ the, +  the ] Kurds.	9
{D Well } [ [ I s-, + {D you know, }  I'm, ] + I've ] had to [ reduce my program, +  reduce my program ]	24
it's nice.	24
{D Well, } no,	33
{C And } what happened is, is that people wanted this shepherd to shepherd and  protect.	24
{C so } I know a little bit about it not, a whole great deal.	24
{C and, }  {F uh, } as soon [ as, + as ] we can get, -	26
[ {C Becaus-, } + {C because } ] I had three younger brothers and sisters myself	24
{D Like } they won't have that, -	9
that's, -	26
{E I mean, } everyone's a manager	24
down here it's like two hundred dollars a day.	24
Uh-huh.	15
They are against it <laughter>.	24
{D Well, } {F um, } I hope you have a nice day today.	38
Good.	38
{F Oh, } I bet.	21
If I'm, ((   ))  at the same, time. -	24
It's at, {F uh } -- -- Trinity, {F uh, }	24
# Yeah. #	15
{D Actually, } it's my son,	24
{F Um. } {C But } I guess it's just one of those things where [ [ if they + if that's what's something ] + it's ] a need for them {D you know. }	9
I think the, -	26
you still have to do it.	24
# Yeah # --	26
and th-, the library canceling all of it's subscriptions.	24
Do you have to, {F uh, } sort the paper and  take out the glossy pages and  [ that, + that ] sort of thing	7
{C So } your big beef with it is the, {F uh, } -	8
They didn't have any shade <laughter>.	24
[ {C and } -- + -- {C and, } ] {F uh, } I don't think anybody roots differently	9
{D well } I'm glad we have two of  them, otherwise, I think they get neurotic if there just one of them.	9
I think it's hard to find a balance there.	9
{C and, {F uh, } then }  we got this new cat,	24
Right.	15
that's right.	21
[ [ I've, + I've ] heard some, + {E I mean } I've heard [ [ sta-, + sta-, ] + statistics ] ] and things [ that, + that ] compare a public education to a private education. {E I mean } [ within + {D like, } within ] the <thumping> same, {F uh, } income groups.	24
{C or } is that, -	26
That might <<faint>>, -	36
That's right,	36
Tha-, # -	26
Yeah.	15
You haven't?	8
{D Well, } in Washington State, if you're a habitual sexual offender, they just don't let you out.	24
Yes.	15
{C but } they'll let you look down the hall.	24
I love to read about real people.	24
That's right,	11
Yeah,	15
Yeah,	36
{C And so, } we didn't really know we weren't supposed to, -	24
[ I, + {F uh, } I'm ] actually working at night	24
Every now and then,	24
Uh-huh.	15
you do.	24
it blows north east.	24
Yes.	15
-- {C and then } it seems like  takes forever to pay that off.	9
{C or } do you like,  {F uh, } just action	35
Yeah.	15
I think most of the time the kids are usually off  watching cartoons or playing video games or [ stuff, +  stuff ] like that.	9
Yeah.	15
{C and then } the next time [ he'll, + {D you know, } he can't ]  seem to hit the side of a barn.	9
Even something so simple as getting a street light in between -- -- lights on the end of the block.	24
Yeah,	15
oh, they're just gorgeous,	9
There are some columns that could be painted a different color # too. #	24
Uh-huh.	15
They publish it every single day.	24
[ It's a, + I think it's a ] sad state of affairs,	9
<Laughter>.	20
uh-huh.	15
{C And, } also, {D  you know, } it's like  [ for, + for ] presentations,	24
[ Did you, + did you ] think that [ C N N, + {D well, } the Gulf War coverage ] would be kind of, {F uh, } an abnormality?	7
Uh-huh.	15
as if the dogs weren't enough, had to have, <throat_clearing> a guinea pig,	24
Yeah.	36
{C or } do you think it can if it's done right?	35
I'm older.	24
Yeah,	4
Uh-huh.	15
their aluminum cans is for, {F uh, } Children's Hospital, for a burn fund --	24
Right.	36
{C and } when I take a break, I'll take a look at the newspaper.	24
{F Oh, } you do --	12
# it's hard to find good child care,	24
I'm kind of like you,	9
we only have seven thousand students in the entire campus.	24
{C And then } they never put anything back.	24
It's, {F uh, } hav-, {F uh, } {F uh, } {D well, } -	26
Right.	15
Actually, [ I think it's, + I think it ] should be  -- -- [ a civic level, + the city level ] and [ a, + a ] system level really to find out,  and [ t-, + to ] see what they need and not overinflate it,	9
{D Well, } {D now, } [ is, + is, ] {F uh, } really terrible. -	9
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } <lipsmack> [ our, + our  ] yard is very, {F uh, } narrow --	24
It's kind of, -	26
{C And } [ I, +  I ] think it's great.	9
# {C And, }  {F uh, } # what's right is wrong and what's wrong is right in some cases.	9
# {D Well, } {C but } you got to look at prohibition though.	9
{C and } then that  money is used during that month.	24
I think it's [ matter, + just a matter ] of [ fund, + funds ] right now as I understand it.  {F Uh, }	24
# {F Oh, } that's nice. #	21
{C and, }  as you probably heard [ from the, + in the ] Dallas and Texas area period the  housing market is just unreal.	24
I have never been to a Dallas Opera	24
<breathing>	20
it was a seventy mile  trip everyday, {D you know, } two ways was seventy miles.	24
{C and } he works,	24
{C and } I'm not, {F um, } <music> totally innocent of that # because, # there's times when you just stay here, watch a tape.	9
{F Uh, } I know in some cases now in  some states, depending on the criminal code, {F uh, } a unanimous verdict is not required.	24
It just seems like we save a little  bit more whereas, # where I was working, # -	24
{F Uh, } I've lost my train of thought.	24
{C And } the doctor said, you didn't do anything.	24
Yeah	15
{C and then } # I go # -- -- back down in May.	24
The cost of immunizations for example, {F uh, } and just [ the legal + <breathing>, the legal ] benefits, {F uh, }	24
{F Uh, } the other person might not know about it.	24
Right.	36
{F uh, } {C so } air conditioning is [ def-, + {F uh, } definitely  ] a necessity for us through two or three months in the summer.	24
{D Well, } my wife's originally from Virginia	24
Oh.	15
They charged you twenty-five dollars just to tell you that, {F huh. }	22
Fernando, glad to know you.	13
{C and } I do know that you get some freezing weather down there on occasion.	9
no.	33
[ I just, +  I ] don't, -	26
I, -	26
we call it an old folks home,	24
{C and then, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
Worked at a camp there,	24
You listen to the music and  then learn to play it [ by lear-, + by hearing ] the intervals and things like that.	24
{C and then } we'd sit down, and talk about it	24
{D like } we try hurtling our couches and stuff.  {D You know, } and. -	24
if I don't have a reel with a button on it, I tend to get so much backlash, it's not worth the trouble <laughter>.	24
{C But } he's a very possessive cat.	24
{C Because } you can get just as far as being a journeyman, carpenter or an electrician or plumber or anything else like that.  Make as much money	9
[ It's, + it's ]  not a kid who's, {D you know, } precocious.	9
{F Oh, } okay,	29
{C And so, } {F um, } a lot of the money isn't put into that,	24
{C And } I think that's [ a, +  a ]  great addition.	9
Yeah.	15
{C or } do you keep it?	7
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well } -- -- {D well, } the mini, that, -	26
# <Laughter>. #	20
# Okay. #	29
Yeah <<very faint>>.	15
I go to both of them now.	24
thank you.	42
Uh-huh.	15
{C and, }  I guess [ he, + he ] did some crazy thing to get some  extra money from the bank and  then ran away, type of deal <laughter>.	24
{F Oh, } the wild flowers are beautiful.	9
Oh.	15
# {D Well, } [ I, + I'll ] have to go get that one I guess. #	37
{C and, }  {F um, } -	26
There was a, -	26
-- {C and } I happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends	24
I don't know, that much about it.	24
{C but } it's not off the list.	9
{F Oh, } wow.	21
{C And } I really feel kind of guilty for not working out more than I do because there's a facility right downstairs where [ all, + {D you know, } all ] we have to do [ is, + is, ] {F uh, } run down there	24
I have, {F uh, } two married,  [ two almo-, + {C and then } two almost ] married	24
{C and so, } {F uh, } it's fully deductible.	24
{D So. }  {C And } I don't know what's going to happen.	24
{C and } I'm wondering are we really going to do this,	24
and especially if you're not a person that is {D like } a medical person maybe or something that the person needs medical treatment.	9
Yeah,	15
Yeah,	15
{C So } they're getting into it.	24
that's true.	36
Uh-huh,	4
Do they have a Mastercard or VISA card?	7
<Laughter>.	20
Right,	15
{D So, } are you really from Texas though?	7
McDonald's, {F uh, } we've sort of been off of that for a while	24
# Yeah # .	15
{C and } they, {D you know, } steal each other's toys and stuff	24
[ {C and, } + {F um, } {C and, } ]  {F uh, } Maryland's great,	9
# Uh-huh.  #	15
{C and } I forget to make a call <laughter> usually.	38
Okay.	29
Do you stay home with kids?	7
{F Oh, } yeah.	36
Right.	15
{E I mean } I'm not a women's libber by any means,	24
It's just, -	26
That's the only way I know.	24
{C and } now it's kind of lingering with kind of still a bit of humidity	9
[ I, + ]   where are they going to get the money?	16
Yep.	4
Oh.	15
Yeah.	30
{C and } they were showing some	24
{C and } it is stripped when you come back.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
The land is paid for cash,	24
# {D Well, } I know # for sure it was,	24
<Popping>.	20
{C and, } {D you know, } they were {D like } [ in a, +  I think it was on ] FORTY-EIGHT HOURS.	24
[ The, +  {F uh, }   I think maybe there's where the ] problem came in, {D you know. }	9
yeah,	15
# <Laughter>. #	20
Yeah.	15
{C And, }  {F uh, } [ we're really, +  we haven't had ] any  problems	24
I didn't hurt it too bad.	24
[ I think, + I think ]  that probably, [ until, +  until ] [ they're really invalids, + {F uh, } the elderly are invalids, ]  I think that they should be able to interact with other people -- -- in an environment that they choose, [ if they can, + if the family ] can afford it.	9
{C so } she [ and, + and ] the three boys and my husband and I went over into Fort Worth to see the space exhibit	24
mine are already in college now,	24
WordPerfect is just so much better [ than, + than ] Wordstar  at least the version of Wordstar that I used to have.	24
Yes,	36
<inhaling>  {C And } [ [ that, + that's been a, ] + that's been a ] nice way of keeping us all aware of each other, I think.	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } for awhile I didn't read a newspaper when I came out here because I didn't find one that I liked.	24
<Laughter>.	20
Is that right?	12
Course that's what, {F um, } -	26
Have you?	7
{C and, } {F uh, } -	26
{F Oh, } wow.	21
Have you been [ a, + to a ] lot of the different historical sites?	7
{F um, } <lipsmack> let's see.	17
Do # it himself. #	2
{C and } we have a state tax as well.	24
{D Well, } yeah,	36
no,	32
{C but } we've never got to talk to another person,	24
{F Uh, } he delivers, {F uh. } -	24
I figured,	24
<Laughter>.	20
I really didn't care for the ending of it.	24
[ I want, + I always say  that I need ] to [ get run-, + start running ]	24
{F Uh, } I was down at about four or five quite awhile ago.	24
it wasn't very well advertised --	24
Yes.	15
{D Well, } {C and } {D actually, } I think that most women's garden clubs that I've been aware of in the past, {F uh, } are only flowers,	24
{D well, } some of the things I like to do are, -	24
{F Uh, } {D well, } [ we, + I guess we ] have to talk about magazines	24
{C because } what happens is, -	9
I don't know,	19
{F Huh, }  rough type, {F huh } <laughter>?	12
{C so, } -	26
-- {C or } [ they, + {D you know, } they ] pad out their staff, or, {D you know, } spend it in bounced checks at the, commissary,	9
{E I mean } no one individual that's true for but for the population as a whole,	9
Maybe a little longer.	24
{C but, } {F uh, } yeah	9
[ {C But, } + {F uh, } {C and, } ] I know my daughter, -	24
It really is,	36
[ I, + I ] don't think that [ [ they, + they, ] + they ] educate them enough [ to, + to ] really know what's going on.	9
Uh-huh.	36
{C and } they get the money from that.	24
[ I, + I ] mostly jump rope more.	24
{C or } are you in the work force	35
{C So, } we're in the process of, {F uh, } revitalizing  the whole situation.	24
{D Well, } half hour.	24
{F Oh, } yeah?	7
Up to a point.	40
#  ((   )) , #   *[[slash error]] Yeah <laughter>.   *[[slash error]]	20
[ I have, + I ] was trying to think of the one I went to a couple of weeks ago,	24
{C And, } {F um, } {C so, }  Kelly growing up, [ he, + he ] felt like [ that, + that ] was a good way on Saturday's that he  developed a good relationship with his father.	24
{C And } she was from Boston,	24
Uh-huh.	15
I don't know,	19
Yeah.	15
{C and } I'm not sure if our policy covers that or not.	24
Right.	15
{C And } I really believe that if you're going to cut down on yourself, you need to cut down somewhat on your <laughter>  friends.	9
do you like to exercise because you want to or because you have to?	7
Right	15
-- {C and } they just plan on being here.	24
# {C and, } # {D you know, } a lot of things like that that really [ ar-, + are ] hard to plan for.	9
I got to where I decided I wanted to pay more rent and get a private bedroom.	24
yeah.	36
{F Um, }	26
Right.	15
We are not real consistent with this,	24
{D see, } {C and, } -	26
remember the last two freezes,	8
Have you had any lately go out?	7
{C and } the next thing you know then, {F uh, } there's always the need [ to, + to ] go and inspect lockers of high school students,	9
{E I mean, } he's up there moving around and smiling like he's happy -- -- [ and, + and ] like all he wants to do [ is, + is ] make the audience enjoy it, too.	24
Well, I guess that's, I guess that's about all I've got to say, about cars <Laughter>.	24
{D well, } my goal is to  try to retire by the time I'm fifty-five.	24
{C Because } it's completely  made up of fast food restaurants	24
Yeah.	15
{F Uh, } it's been raining pretty much  continually now, {F uh, } off and on, maybe one day of break, for about a month.	24
{C But } I do force myself  to do it at least three times a week.  Which I don't feel  like is enough,	24
{C but } -- -- you can't, {D you know, }	26
absolutely.	36
that's about the only time [ in the, + in the ] summer, {F uh, } if you're watching T V for the weather, even though it's very hard to predict what's going on,	9
Uh-huh.	15
That sounds great.	21
Yeah,	15
{D Well, } we've been married for five and a half years	24
[ I, + I ] don't mind my phone number and address or work phone being given, {D you know, } when I have to cash a check.	24
{F Uh, } yeah,	4
At the time, <sigh> we really could  not afford it	24
# [ it, + # <static> it ] would still have to affect you the same way.	9
Say, -	26
{D You know. } In that standpoint.	26
I'm tired,	24
Do you do most of yours in tents?	7
-- they thrash around,	24
Yeah.	15
they have  ((   ))  Muslims to deal with -- -- as well as Saddam Hussein.	9
Yeah.	15
[ that's, + that's ] nice to do, that is.	9
{C And } I think that's really what's  been hurting, {F uh, } the, {F uh, } Rangers.	9
Huh.	15
Not a Cubbies fan, {F huh. }	7
Uh-huh.	15
[ I, + I'm ] working for a lady who has a strawberry field,	24
they're the big team in Rochester.	24
I would tend, myself, to say that <sigh> we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases [ anytime a, + anytime [ a, + one ] ] of the parties wants one.	9
Yeah.	15
{C And } now, I need it.	24
{C And } after the two week period was up, {F uh, } she then informed me that the woman no longer wanted the little puppy and wanted to know if we wanted to keep it.	24
I think she does a lot of research, too.	9
Yeah.	15
{C And then, } {F oh, } March came around,	24
{C and, so } we decided to stay.	24
{F Oh, } okay.	29
{C or } that, -	26
{F Anyway, } I dealt with two or three kids today that are going to end up where somebody [ has, + ] making a decision what to do with them.	24
{D well, }  especially when <breathing> anyone who's ever done any kind of drafting or engineering [ w-, +  {F uh, } [ dr-, + drawing, ] ] <breathing> {F um, }  <breathing> -	9
{D Well, } he wasn't a whole lot.	24
[ that was, + we were ] kind of looking for one  that would be a mixture	24
{F Huh } <<faintly>>.	15
[ it's, + it's, ] {F uh, } got the extra little oomph of interest.	9
{C And } here's this bum that didn't have a job --	24
{C or, } -	26
Dr. Price?	14
They are [ good, + usually good ] aren't they?	7
{D well, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] guess if I was having a dinner party [ I, + depending on the number of people, I ] might cook [ a, + {D like } a ] brisket or a roast or [ a, + maybe a ] chicken dish --	24
{C So. } -	26
{C and } {F oh, } by the way, do you want me [ to, + to ] bury the cat # <laughter>. #	25
They have [ regular, + {F uh, } regular ] family reunions every summer.	24
{D Well, } have you ever visited, {F um, } {D like } Los Angeles or any place [ that's ever, + it's kind of known, ] that it has, {F uh, } pollution in it's air?	7
Yeah,	36
Uh-huh <noise>.	15
{C And } [ we c-, +  <breathing> we called ]  the City	24
That's true.	36
{D well, } there is lots of pretty  country further west.	9
<Laughter> That's the part that scares me, you know.	9
{C And, } {F uh, } -	26
[ the biggest, + {D you know, } that's the three biggest  ] things to me, {D you know. }	24
Oh.	15
{C and } they had closed the whole road because of, {F uh, } {F uh, } # fog, #	24
It was just government in general.   From times past, {D you know } -- -- on	24
They show up and all their kids.	24
For nothing.	24
{E I mean, } [ I've only been out of, + I've been out of ] college only two years,	24
Rome, New York,	30
Yeah.	15
{F Uh, } yeah,	15
{F Uh, } not too bad really.	24
Yes --	4
There's too many societies involved, {F uh, }	9
# Right,	15
{C so } <laughter>. -	26
Oh.	15
{F Um, }	15
<laughter> They know I don't like it.	24
-- {C because } [ she wanted, + {D you know, } she just seemed ] to enjoy it so much	24
Yes.	15
{C so } [ all the, + all we ] do is turn, -	24
You find out more, #	9
I know <breathing>.	21
He's had OUT FOR JUSTICE	11
{C and } they want to go out and run in it and  get all muddy, {D You know, }	9
I've enjoyed it <laughter>.	38
-- Yeah.	4
A better place to be or whatever, {D you know }	9
{C and } he had started this, {F um, } save the environment club.	24
# Yeah, {F uh, } #	15
how do you think that, {F uh, } the viewpoints differ?	31
Do you really believe that?	7
Uh-huh.	15
[ I, + I  ] agree totally <laughter>.	36
I think that'd be neat.	9
{C and } really me and my sister are the only ones that will deal with my grandmother.	24
Uh-huh.	15
That's i-, -	26
{E I mean } [ he's always, + {D you know, } <lipsmack> he really ] does have a good home.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } <talking> <noise> they've only deliberated four hours or, something	24
{C so, } -	26
Nice talking to you too.	38
I wonder how many of his lives he missed, when that happened.	24
[ [  I, + I, ] + I ] really think we're going to far overboard with all of this.	9
{D So. } Anyway,  [ maybe, + {D you know, } maybe ] [ it'll, + it'll ] help in some way,	9
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } not so much pay.	32
Hi.	6
<Meow>.	20
They have such good style that, {F uh } -- -- [ it's, + {F uh, } <laughter> it's ] pretty fun to watch.	9
[ that's, + that's  ] the digital one.	24
I know,	36
Okay.	13
-- {C but } that's, -	26
that would take some planning	24
{C but } [ c-, + {D you know, } ends up costing  ] the company lots and lots of money.	24
Uh-huh.	15
-- {D well, } no,	33
[ I would like, + I'd like ] to see that.	24
{D Well, } I've gone to, {D you know, } one for real  live Trek Convention	24
Gosh --	21
{C and } you realize that you're not buying anything on sale your paying, so  much more for that item, because you've got finance charge and the cost of having  that card every year which is what, forty dollars sometimes just to have the card.	9
Yeah.	15
{F Um, } my concern is the economy because as I understand it Puerto Rico has a very low [ sta-, + {F uh, } standard ] of living or  at least, {F um, } annual average income.	9
{D well, } back to the original subject,	24
You could be responsible for that yourself.	18
# it's # good stuff.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I said, I've been a happy man since I haven't, fooled with that checkbook, {D you know } <laughter>.	24
{C so. } {D Anyway, } other than that, {F uh, } is kind of how we do it	24
I keep talking about my father because he owned a house,	24
# Yeah. #	15
{C and } I've got lots of documentation I need to review  and some I need to revise.	24
# Right. #	15
I think that's a real, real neat idea.	9
{C and } they don't have the right to vote --	24
Oh.	15
{C And } [ there, + there's ] so much, -	26
{F Uh, } got to eat some different kinds of foods and meet people from a different culture	22
<laughter> {C but, } -	26
Teaching?  <noise>.	7
Uh-huh.	15
they have cleanup outings.	24
I think the last movie that we went out to see was DANCES WITH WOLVES.	24
{D Well, } {D you know, } the way the economy's going and inflation and the recession and all that, I think [ we, + we ] really need to try to stay out of debt as much as possible.	24
Oh.	15
-- [ {C and, } + {C and } ] they still live somewhat independently	9
I really can.	24
{F Oh, } great.	21
I do not want a day care or an aunt or anybody else raising them.	24
{C so } a lot of kids are just being promoted from year to year	9
yeah,	26
[ [ Is it, + is it, ] + is it ] flooding anywhere?	7
No joke <laughter>.	21
{C but } I haven't been there.	5
<Laughter>.	20
They're sociopathic.	34
{C but, } it costs less.	9
Yeah,	36
{C and, } {F uh, } -	26
{C and } they go fishing, up there.	24
My mother also was [ very +  very ]  independent.	24
No,	36
-- {C and } we have trumpet vine and moon flowers,	24
Yeah.	15
I'm impressed.	9
{C and } he, so far he's bitten ten people.	24
Not too far away.	9
{C And, } {F uh, } normally never the twain shall meet.	9
-- {C and } she use to work for a [ veter-, + veterinarian ]	24
{F Oh, } uh-huh.	15
It was real close to where I worked.	24
{C And then } if you're a computer operator [ and, + ] {F uh, } there's really no big deal,	9
{E I mean, } # I # graduated high school in sixty-eight	13
{C or, }  {F um, } we do have  customers that, {F um, } their concerns are in the work place	24
{F Oh, } goodness.	21
# Yeah.	15
Yeah,	15
[ I, + I'm ] saying I want to do it,	24
{C and, } -	26
{C or } are you familiar with any of that?	7
Sure.	15
{C but } basical-, {D well, } Route Seventy [ and, + and ] {F uh, } Route Forty.	24
Okay.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C so } we need to -- -- keep exercising just to be able to, {F uh. } -	9
one of the little mini vans?	7
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	36
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } I do a lot of woodworking	24
{C And, }  {F uh, } when I seen some of my friends that  have taken that six week old baby, {D you know, } to someone else, it's just, I can imagine how emotional  it must be. [ [ And, + and, ] + ] {D you know, } multiplied by the fact that you don't really trust the person  or you're uncomfortable with the situation  ((   )) , as far as child care, {F um, }	24
{C and }  [ it was, + it was ] really, really, really bad.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } I'd like to have my gun.	24
Was it?	12
{D like } last weekend was homecoming	24
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	36
{D Well, } {D actually } I voted it for the presidential election,	24
Yeah,	26
{C And } <T V> nowhere does it [ say you h-, + asks you whether you have ] permission or not to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone.	24
There you go,	36
{F Um, } yes.	4
Give physicals to the rest of the family members	9
# Yes.  #	15
yeah.	15
{F Uh, } I'm against it	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
I think it's a severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say, {D well, } we're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you're, {F uh, } {D you know, } worthy of working for us.	9
Right.	15
But just with the quality requirements that Ford is putting on us and the way they come into our plants -	9
Okay.	15
{C And, } {D you know, } [ [ I don't, + I don't  ] like, + I don't [ g-, +  ever get ]  ] anything over the phone because I don't want to give my social security number out.	24
{D well, } yeah,	36
{C so }  [ [ my, + my, ] + I think my ] insurance dropped about sixty dollars a year.	24
{C and } they try to get information out of me.	24
{F Oh, } yes.	15
All right.	29
{C and, } {D you know, } what's right -- -- because there's no mother at home --	24
# I enjoyed that. #	24
{E I mean, } it would only take three or four days	24
his children will be out of high school before he's forty-five.	24
# <laughter>. #	20
What do you think about that subject?	31
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } we pretty much do, {F um, } plastic milk cartons  and, {F um, } {F um, } {F um, } newspapers.	24
I know who you're talking about.	24
We have a little path that we do. [ {C And, } + {F uh, } except ] if it's raining or real cold -- -- which it hasn't been --	24
{E Excuse me, } my throat's not as clear today as it should be.	41
that's me.	24
{C and } in kindergarten we learned to share,	25
Uh-huh.	15
I'm so sick and  tired of that. #	24
Exactly right,	36
I don't know,	40
Do they?	7
Uh-huh.	36
-- {C but, } {F uh, } seems like, {D you know, } -	9
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	36
uh-huh.	15
Not right now, of course --	24
I agree it should be in effect.	36
Have you painted anything recently.	7
{C and } that's about it.	24
that's true.	36
That's the only thing that bothers me.	24
Oh.	15
Sure.	15
{C So } [ that really, + that ] makes you think, {D you know. }	9
-- {C and } my parents went to visit her	24
{F Oh, } gosh,	21
I remember that being, {F uh, } here a few years ago.	24
{E I mean, } it jus-, -	26
{F Um, } uh-huh.	15
I think there is going to be some increasing problem because I think women are expecting husbands to do more parenting	9
[ to + ]  [ if you, + if you ] go on the attack, [ i-, + ] and put some sensational thing before the public, as Mike Dukakis learned in the last campaign, -	9
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
No,	36
<Laughter> {D Well, } that's great.	21
but, -	26
{F Oh, } that's a good size.	21
{C so } {E I mean } aerobics is  something I'd hate to give up.	24
yeah.	4
I think that is important too.	24
{C And } that is, it gets so hot that, {D you know, } a lot of things die during the Summer from the heat.	9
{C And, }  {F uh, } I was thinking about, -	24
I'm, {F uh, } member of the American Meteorological Society,	24
# friends # are cool,  parents aren't.	9
[ {C and, } +  {C and } ] they actually have them perform the music,	24
Yeah.	15
{F um, } I had been doing a lot of crocheting.	24
{D Like } if you wanted to sell your pistol to me.	24
{D so } I don't know [ why, +  what ] that was reading it for --	24
{F Oh, } I'm in Flower Mound.	24
[ I, + I, ] -	26
It is.	24
you can just go ahead and get that taken care of	24
Yeah.	15
{C So, } that's a lot of fun	21
Businesses, {F uh } -- -- if purchasing things mail order,	24
[ I, +  last year, {F um, } I ]  had a little part time job in a private, {F um, } high school, tutoring, {F um, } high school students with learning disabilities.	24
we bought the car new	24
So did I.	24
you just have less a variety, I guess.	9
Right.	15
# Uh-huh. #	15
{C so } yes	4
{C and } it would take a hit fairly well,	24
Yes,	36
I read the book	24
{C and, }  {F uh, } one of the things I thought about was a lot of the drunk cases that they were having, [ that, + especially for repeat offenders that, ] {F uh, } -	24
<Laughter>.	20
{F Oh, } Pogo,	2
{C Because } my husband used to work out three  days a week [ with, + ] {F uh, } at the Texas Instruments gym.	24
{C but } [ in, + {F uh, } in ] the paper one you have to separate.	24
<Laughter> Yeah,	15
Yes.	4
{C and  then } just nothing happens, # just #  endless, endless, endless appeals.	24
He likes to do that -- -- {D you know } <laughter>.	24
I know I was part of the me generation where [ [ they didn't, +  ((   ))  so  many of them didn't, ] + people didn't ] care.	24
Yeah.	15
That's true.	36
That's amazing.	21
I don't think that sports has to make a lot of money,   or you do away with it.	24
you got young boys or girls, that at fourteen or twelve years old that are committing murders and, no remorse, what so ever.	9
{C So, } it seems like a of people live there,	9
Mils and microns.	24
{C and } [ I, + I ] still try to keep up with Buffalo because [ they just, + they just ] impressed me as being so efficient	24
{F Uh, } it does seem to be a lot of habits to break.	9
{C so } we, -	26
Yeah,	15
{C And, }  {F uh, } {D well } I fell in love  with this,  {F uh, } it's a Chinchilla Persian, and, {F uh, } brought him home,	24
# {D Well, } that's # interesting.	21
{C And } medical bill. -	9
They've had one in Gladewater for years and years and  years.	24
That's what I was thinking [ they, + they ] sometimes do.	24
what you're, -	26
{D Well } they can get into almost   anything anymore <laughter>.	2
{C But. } -	26
{C But, }  {F uh, } just when I thought I really enjoyed my hobby, yours sounds great <laughter>.	24
{C And } I think there is a point where you just have to get away.	9
{C but } we just, -	26
# {D So, }  # {F oh, } year or so ago he found out	24
{C and } it appears -- -- in front of them,	9
Uh-huh.	15
<Tones>.	20
uh-huh.	15
# right. #	36
{C But, }  she hasn't talked to anybody, in Dallas, yet.	24
# {D Well, } # I've decided now in fact,  [ I'm just, + ] I'm substitute teachers aid which is [ a, + ] afar cry from my travel agent career, # [ y-, + ] which I loved.	24
{F Uh, } for example, I remember on one  trip to France <breathing> when I started planning the trip, I think, {F uh, }  a dollar was worth nine or ten	24
-- {C and } [ her, + the rest of her  ] family and her regular doctors and everybody she trusted and knew was in Dayton, and were several thousand miles away --	24
{C And } they all said, Golden Retriever	24
Right,	15
{C because, } {F uh, } the ones that  we use, [ yo-, + ] {D you know, } are like UNIX base systems.	24
{D Well, } they squeaked out a game on Sunday.	24
You bet,	21
It sounds to me like, {F uh, }  you're doing well.	24
Thanks for talking. #	38
I don't think the parole system is really helping that much <laughter>.	9
{C and } he's a good dog,	24
Yeah,	15
{F Um, } Gene Hackman's a good actor. # I think. #	9
Uh-huh.	15
My children are in college.	24
Uh-huh <noise>.	15
[ it's, + it's ] less degree days,	24
Uh-huh.	15
you're right. #	36
<Laughter> He's in here somewhere,	25
[ it will be interesting to see what, + It would be interesting to see how ] the data base, -	9
I have not skied that area.	24
I didn't do it myself.	24
I have not,	24
{C and } I usually, when I hear about a movie that's supposed to be very good -- -- even if it's in a genre I don't like, -	24
simple as that.	24
some people are a little bit  fanatical about it.	9
Huh?	14
Uh-huh.	15
[ he was, + he was ] actually on the jury,	24
{D Well, } {F uh, } let's see,	17
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	4
The flavor is better I think in between.	24
# {C And then, } {F uh, } # [ we, + we ] go on from there	9
{C and, }  {F uh, } in fact I think I was the first person in our department to have my thesis published on  [ recyclable pa-, + recycled paper. ]	24
Yeah.	15
Could I ask you to hold one minute?	18
we call [ the T I, + {E I'm sorry } an I B M P C ] compatible.	24
{C and } said it was real good	24
<Laughter>.	20
Right.	15
if things are kind of hectic at school and people are running late, they kind of wait on us.	24
it was friends too.	24
# That helps # a lot.	9
{C but } I don't know	19
{D you know, } [ mo-, + movie ] prices up here	24
and, uh, I mean whether, -	26
[ [ they just -- + -- they  need that, + I think they just need that ] [ one, + one ] element to push them over the top, {D you know. }	24
-- {C and } if you go in an area that there is just not much of a job market -- -	9
They also have [ pre-, + a fairly ] large liberal arts college as well.  A sort of, a separate, {D you know, } arts and  sciences college.	24
It's not [ like, +   like ] driving a little sports car.	9
<Laughter>.	20
[ I, +  I ] don't follow baseball [ that, +  that ] closely,	24
{C and } whenever we'd start a fight we'd all apologize and hug each other -- -- {D you know, }	25
{C so }  right outside the back door, I've got the two burlap bags hung up for the cans and bottles,	24
like some member of the  family gets the flu or whatever	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
I don't see anything that they could do.	9
Uh-huh.	15
and, uh, -	26
<Laughter>.	20
do those little things,	22
{C But } {F um, } -	26
{C and, } {F uh, } -	26
we've been down the parkway a lot,	24
{C and } he's really sort of a temporary employee at a place.	24
True.	21
it was, {D yeah, } in some of the critical things, like [ the off-, + special investigations, ] at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person,	24
{C and, } {F uh, }  I talked to a thirteen year old last night who [ 's, +  {F uh, } goes ] to, {F uh, } one of the Plano high schools  or junior highs, I guess,	24
{D Well, } how about who, -	39
Yeah.	15
<breathing> it's really, -	26
{C and } [ I, + I'm ] going to take it pretty seriously.	24
{F Oh, } it is Japanese.	12
Uh-huh.	15
There are kids, families, that should just simply be taken out of the homes, {D you know. } {C And, } {F uh, } {F uh, } {D you know, } {F uh, } just removed from those situations,	9
{C And } they were just all over him and sitting on his head, the whole nine yards.	24
Yeah	36
{C and, } {D you know, } this area where record retention is, there's only  a few people that work there,	24
not that I'm aware of.	24
[ They've, +   I think they have ] maybe two people a year go get,  (( get ))  their # P H D. #	24
{D well, } {F um, } let's see,	17
It's, {F uh, } -	26
{C and, } {F uh, } if you really water a lot, you can do it,	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } I'll have headache  and everything,	24
I guess that's the only way I could do it.	24
you know you're stroke is just one of one or two or three -- -- or four, {D you know, } that's going to make any difference.	9
{C Or } he's hanging around with a cop trying to pick up the stuff.	24
Right.	15
Yeah,	36
Bye-bye <talking>.	38
{C But } there is still a lot of beautiful places to go and see. {D You know, } On all of the islands.  {D You know, }	24
{D You see, } those who had bad experiences talk about them.	24
{D so, } -	26
{F Uh, } I guess, let me think of another important  thing to look at when you look into college, {F um, }	17
{C and } we just need  more discipline country wide.	9
{C And, } {F uh, } [ it's, + it's ] tragic that, {D you know, } when people live so long that they, {F uh, } [ don't have a pla-, + really don't have a place ] to go.	9
{F Oh } really?	12
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well } that would be an eye opener, wouldn't it?	7
I know.	36
if the cats [ will, + will ] jump up on things and knock things over all # the time, #	24
Right.	15
{F Um, } I'm trying to think of what  else we like to eat.	17
I'm the same way.	36
he did,	36
no,	33
{F Oh, } okay,	29
Yeah.	4
{C so, } I guess we have [ the, + the ] same reaction whether we came about  it from the same place or not.	9
{C and } -- -- the rest of the country is not or something like that.	24
Yeah --	15
Right.	15
[ They've got a, + they've got basically [ a, + {F uh, } {D you know, } a ] ] lock  on a lot of the market.	9
Yeah.	15
-- # {C and } that's hard. #	24
you may find one little, {F uh, } news item interesting	9
{C And then, } {F um, } I can't remember that guy's name, the one that held out for the money	24
{C and, } {F uh, } we lived in a smaller city,	24
<Laughter>.	20
Now, [ I, + I ]  also liked, {F uh, } {F oh, } GONE WITH THE WIND or some of the classic, like THE LAWRENCE OF ARABIA	24
I can imagine.	21
# Yeah. #	15
if you can take a muffler off and only replace, -	24
{C and } also, {F um, } senior care facilities, {D you know, } you hear abuse.	24
{C and } {D you know } <laughter>, -	26
<Child_talking>.	20
Yeah.	15
I'm in San Antonio.	24
{C So } I stopped worrying about money.	24
I was amazed when I came to work,	24
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	36
{C So } they're going to by, -	24
{C but } I don't know what I did to my knee.	24
uh-huh.	15
[ I, + {F uh, } I  ] grew up on farm so I've got that, {F uh, } {D you know, } take care of yourself attitude.	24
<Throat_clearing>.	20
{C and } they're cheap	9
{D Well, } we don't get Channel Two.	24
Make it financially, {F uh, } attractive to recycle --	9
{C And } {D see, } they do that as their job. Whereas, # {D you know, } # for us it, -	22
Uh-huh.	15
Yes,	36
I didn't know they had that.	24
He, -	26
Yeah.	15
the one I had most recently [ was, + was  ] one that,  [ was, + ha-,  ] -	24
[ I, + I'd ] have to almost go take a class or something like that.	24
Kuenzer, K U E N Z E R,	24
You have to look on that, on the, {F uh, } positive side of that.	9
they are.	24
{F Uh, } <breathing> it's hard to say.	9
{F Oh, } how marvelous.	21
Yeah.	4
Uh-huh.	15
I don't know exactly why.	24
{C and } he's heading off, with any kind of luck,	24
{C and } [ then + now ] we make a point of watching <laughter>.	24
{C And, } To the point that you kind of say to yourself, especially home day care -	24
it has a radical fringe to it that, {F uh, } I've sort of backed away from.	24
[ I, + {F uh, } I ] have the same dilemma,  I think.  {F Uh, }	24
{C So } if they say a certain  way, then why not believe them.	9
{C and } he would give a little talk about <laughter> mountain things.	24
Right.	15
[ Money, + Money  ] is not the answer.	9
Yeah,	25
{C or, } -	26
you can't enjoy it.	9
{C And } those fees to join a club.	24
{C but } we told him not to tell us,	24
{D you know, } do you work for T I?	7
{C So } it's like you really have to tell as much as you can which is not much in that amount of time.	24
I have so mu-, # {D you know, } -	26
{C and } it's really useful.	9
good,	21
That's right.	36
{D Well, } [ I don't, + {E I mean, } I don't ] know what you think about the, subject,	28
I know some friends who went to see it.	24
Yes.	15
I have  a solution, {D you see. }	24
{E I mean } I hadn't even imagined it, {D you know. }	24
<<Background voices>> Up here in the Dallas Metroplex it's awful.	24
Yeah,	26
<Laughter>.	20
{C So } you can still [ get a, + get [ a, +  a ] ] good house for a very, very reasonable price.	24
that's what I like to do.	24
{D Well, } [ it's, + it's ] a real problem,	9
{C and, }  {F uh, } it's been really wonderful.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } {D you know, } I haven't, {F oh, } -	24
{F uh, } some of my things,	26
{C and } the air conditioning went out on the car <laughter>,	24
Right.	15
{F Um, } {C so }  we didn't ever make that mistake again, luckily <baby>.	24
{C and } that's  what we all are looking for, isn't it,	7
<Laughter> I've never heard that one,	24
[ We go, + we go ] through Enid, {D you know, } quite a bit.	24
they do,	11
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } now they have to clean those up,	24
Right.	15
I don't know if you're in the big city,	24
Yeah,	36
{C But, }  you also manage to make them.	8
I've thought about it several times	24
<Laughter> Take our time. -	13
[ [ [ it, +  we, ] +   I, ] +  I ] read an interesting article in the paper  that discussed,  {F uh, } that, {F uh, }	24
uh-huh.	15
{F Uh. }	26
{C and, so, } [ I, + I ] don't know,	19
{C And } because they're so deficient in English,  they haven't been able to get jobs.	24
{C and } it's so much easier,	9
[ I, +  {F uh, } I ] come home	24
{D You know, } # I didn't know anything  about Bush or Dukakis. #	24
Let's face it, {D you know, } we're not none of us like  they [ pro-, + portray ] it on those shows.	9
{C So } I bought myself [ [ a, + a, ] + a ] Nissan -- -- a two forty S X.	24
Yeah.	15
That's right.	11
you got to do what you got to do, {D you know } to get along, too,	9
# Whatever their talents, # yeah.	30
Oh.	15
{C but, } {F uh, } I think people [ are, + ] would be interested if you had one, {E I mean. }	24
{D Well, } it can get expensive --	9
<laughter>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
{C so } [ I'm, + ] [ I'm + ] a real radio buff, especially [ on the w-, + ] when I'm doing chores.	24
{F Um. }	15
Right.	15
# Yeah,	15
{C and } [ they, + they ] sure were right,	24
What do you think about, {F uh, } the way the criminal justice system handles trials?	31
[ the pro-, + the problem ] is so incredibly complex.	9
Uh-huh.	36
Like I said, it sounds like [ you're, + you've ] really got it under control.	22
yeah.	26
{F Oh, } know <laughter>.	9
you di-, {D you know, } -	26
They, {F uh, } auctioned some tools and, # things # like that,	24
Yeah.	30
{C so. } Anyway, I don't know if our time is getting up here	24
Yeah.	15
He does somewhat.	24
Yeah,	15
One of the things I found interesting, -	24
Yeah.	15
{C but } I have friends that go to Utah all the time #	24
{F Uh, } # mostly # -- -- that's my difficulty.	24
Yeah,	36
We had an engineer in there every ten minutes.	24
Right.	15
{C And so } I guess that's what they decide to do --	9
Yeah.	15
I'm trying to think [ of, + of ] other things that I do that will be considered exercise, <laughter>,	24
Yeah <throat_clearing>.	15
I know # when I was doing my, {F uh, }  basic training in A I T -- -- there was guys who would fool around	24
{C And, } -	26
They get real nasty, the (( hyundee ))  helicopters come out	24
{C and } you can go to another shop and get it for maybe sixty cents [ or nin-, + or ninety ] cents --	9
He doesn't get, {F um, } vacation benefits	24
{C and } you {C either } live in really low priced housing {C or } you live on the other side of town in the high price apartments.	24
[ [ I learned, + I, ] + I learned ] Wordstar, {F uh, }	24
{C and, } {F uh, } there is a big difference between Texas and California.	24
Huh.	15
I know,	36
Your views, -	18
To me that just doesn't sound like a valid argument because this company is paying you good money that you're working for --	9
See, I'm concerned [ that, + that ] since he's banned demonstrations altogether, that he's going to do the type of thing that happened in Tiananmen Square,	9
that's all right.	27
Right.	15
They're just getting, {F uh, } put on probation or something, because the prisons don't have enough room	9
this would be nice [ if + ]	9
{C and, } [ I just, + I ] love that,	24
# Yeah,	15
{D so } you have a few more years.	8
{C And, } {D you know, } it's sort of a popular view of, {F um, } what happened way back then.	9
{C And then, } {D see } I didn't cross stitch the actual thumb print,	24
Uh-huh.	15
# We need # to go.	24
I don't care if we don't have anything else,	24
Um.	38
{C and } I called there to see if they had it	24
{D Now } we have, {F uh, } one takes piano lessons, # somewhere # on one afternoon	24
Gumbo,	30
Yeah.	15
I'm really struggling with it.	24
Yeah.	15
Getting into a credit card fiasco is easy.	9
I do not know how your folks were,	28
-- {C and then } it'll be overturning	9
people from California seem to be more health motivated all around.   {E I mean, } as far as the diet, and  everything.  {F Uh, } the diet and, {F uh, } just your health consciousness,	9
Are the temperatures real extreme there	8
{C and } the wind and  everything was incredible.	24
{C And } if he didn't like what you did, he killed you.	24
# Yeah. #	15
{C and } they're getting nicer.	9
I'm sorry,	41
The other thing, [ I, +  I ] think if you do get overextended a little bit, you need to  be sure and pay it off, {F uh, } more than one at a time, because   I think you could run forever paying what they require.	9
{C and } it's just too expensive.	9
my favorite show is MASTERPIECE THEATRE	24
I know that, {F uh, } my sister, -	24
{D Well, } that isn't [ a, + a ] true false or right or wrong test here.	34
yeah --	15
I've been  disappointed in it and  also pleased in it.	24
Uh-huh.	15
I think I like the <laughter> Porsche's philosophy a little bit better, although it's not really practical.	24
# [ If they reported every, + # if they reported every ]  violent crime in Atlanta [ it would take, + it would probably take ] the whole news hour <laughter>.	9
{D Well, } December seventy-two, was when we bombed North Vietnam,  and then they released the prisoners in early seventy-three, [ in that, + in that ] time frame.	24
# Oh.  # Uh-huh.	15
Right.	15
{E I mean, } not the one I take now.	24
it's my feeling that if you don't have a role model to follow -- -- then it's kind of tough.	9
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] teaching I still see that that's where most of the woman are.	9
[ [ I, +  I, ] + {D Well } I ] have, {F uh, } these,	19
{C and, } {F uh, } in fact, just two weeks ago I helped my neighbor out on his brakes on his car.	24
-- {C and, } {F uh, } then, {F oh, } I don't know what -	24
I don't know,	19
Yeah,	15
{C and } the governor's opposed to it being [ that, + {F uh, } the ] Democrat that he is, # and # Mario Cuomo --	24
It's been a long time.	24
{F Oh, } absolutely.	36
That sounds interesting,	21
{C But } I don't, -	26
I feel like there should be some kind of coverage made,	9
# Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	4
I, I agree.	36
[ I, + I ] couldn't see it worth getting a nomination for, {F uh, } best picture.	9
a little bit.	24
I think I would just sitting here talking about it,	9
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah.	36
{C and } I've just started drinking a new water called Clearly Canadian,	24
Right.	15
Yeah,	36
# Yeah. #	15
# Yeah. #	15
{C But, } {F uh, } my great-grandfather was put in a nursing home when he was a hundred and three.	24
Uh-huh.	15
<Sniffing>.	20
{C And then } you think, {E I mean, } [ I ha-, +  {E I mean, } I can remember, I have ] not been out of school that long,	24
Summer place.	30
# You do? #	7
{C So } [ [ it's, + it's, ] + that's, ] a lot of fun.	24
{F Uh, } {D well, } I would like for one time in my life to have a convertible.	24
that we can make our mortgage payments	2
Yeah.	15
Had some money in her pocket, yeah.	21
I think that the main issue at home -- -- is being comfortable -- -- in your clothing <laughter>.	9
{C And } you can use what ever rationale you want,	9
# Uh-huh. #	15
We were hoping on burning a lot of the effluent up there.	24
she's twenty-one years old	24
it's, -	26
-- {C but } I know I can do it.	24
Otherwise, he might have been driving trucks or framing  houses, {D you know, } from here to eternity.	9
Right.	15
{C but } they're not paying income tax.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } all of a sudden, I don't know <breathing>, [ it's just, +  it's ] eating me alive.	24
I think it is.	36
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	4
I have two little ones.	24
Yes,	15
{C and, }  {D you know, } he qualified [ for, + for ] the help,	24
Uh-huh.	15
There's so many, -	9
I was born there.	24
Exterior,	30
Yeah.	15
<Laughter>.	20
{D You know, } I thought they, {F uh, }  showed a tremendous restraint in their reactions towards everything,	9
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] I think we sing better because of that.	24
Yeah.	15
I think [ you're, +  you're ] going to find that just because the United States, {D you know, }  there is such a demand here, the market, {D you know. } -	9
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
{C and, } {F uh, } we have been in Panama	24
<Lipsmack> {D Well, } [ the, + the ] one thing that I know does seem to happen from people I've talked to on this, is that in the situation you just said where it's nine to three, or some such number, [ that there's, an effect starts being + that there's starts being ] a lot of peer pressure -- -- going on	9
really there could be, {F um, }  some scandals involved, if, {D you know, } it wasn't people that were really fair and [ le-, + {D you know, } in a legal ] way or something,	9
{D You know, } {D so. }	26
Uh-huh.	15
Oh.	15
{C But, }  {F uh, } I know we had a problem  down here with, {F uh, } [ oil, +  people taking oil ] out of their cars -- -- and just putting it down [ [ the d-, +  {D you know, } the s-, ] + the drain sewer. ]	24
{C or } you can take it off and let it cool  ((   )) -	24
{C and } I, -	26
{C so, }  I'd have to say that, {F uh, } [ it, +  {D you know, } the people who do it, ] {D well, }  some feel it's rewarding.	9
# I'm a historian, #	24
{F Oh, } uh-huh.	15
I've -	26
Yeah,	15
That's neat.	21
# Yep.  #	36
No,	33
They did.	36
{F Oh, } hey.	21
{D you know, } that's a good way to approach it.	9
Yeah,	15
{C so. } -	26
You just couldn't get phones.	24
{C and } the hotel that we stayed in, -	24
Yeah,	36
Yeah.	15
# {F Oh, } my gosh. #	21
{C and } it's real hard [ to, + to  ] tell them, {D you know, } that you're not interested.	24
I know a lot of wives feel like they have to vote the way that their husbands vote.	24
{C but } we've got, {D you know, } kids here in the United States that are dying everyday, too. {D You know, } and being, # abused # and neglected	9
{C and } we had a milk shoot at the side of the house.	24
I was limited.	24
-- {D you know, } I, -	26
where are you?	39
{C But, } -	26
it's just eight and a quarter just seems like an awfully lot [ of, + of ] tax on {F uh, } any sale, as far as I'm concerned, {F um, }	9
I work for Texas Instruments.	24
{C and } I worked for a dentist	24
{D well, } I like them, too.	24
{F Oh, } yeah,	15
{C but } it's rather almost as infamous here [ as it was, + as it was ] with, {F uh, } the Rodney King problem.	24
{C and } it's at Plano Road and Campbell.	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh	15
{C and } it was, {F um, } very scary to see what they found out.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
there is a place out here, {F uh, } called Shorties Lane out here in Harrisville --	24
I, -	26
We keep track of personal budgets and things like that on it.	24
uh-huh.	4
{C so. } -	26
{C and } my little  girl will start French horn next year,	24
the simple things like that,	24
Is it pretty -- -- nasty?	7
# Yeah. #	15
I don't know if it's one of the Americans or the import ones where, {F uh, }  they actually have {D like, } {F uh, } some bucket seats in the back	24
{F Hey, } I've got another clue for you for college.	24
Yeah,	36
That happens on occasion,	9
Yeah.	15
{C because } I take them to a girl at work,	24
Oh.	29
{F Oh, } how wonderful.	21
{F uh, } look at them,	18
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } I was reading the book,	24
Yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
What I like to do mostly is stir fries	24
I must admit I'm not always real politically active	24
# {D You know, } {C and } it's like, # -	24
[ Do you have a, + do you have any, ] {F uh, } major preferences as far as <breathing> television?	7
I guess they're trying to gain more public acceptance of things like that.	9
Yeah.	15
Now how they going to fix it, I don't know.	24
Okay,	38
they buy the second.	24
{C and, } {F um, } [ they're past this, + they've been ] latchkey children for a while,	24
<Laughter> No,	32
Uh-huh.	15
we might go again [ on a, + on a ] van.	24
sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad.	9
-- [ I wish, + I just wish ] it wouldn't come all at once <laughter>.	24
Yeah,	15
yes,	4
{C But } it was like he knew -- -- {D you know, }	24
Bye-bye <Noise> <<TV or radio>>.	38
# {D Well, } yeah,	4
I like to do, -	24
all set.	24
{D Well, } it sounds good,	21
we do.	24
-- <Laughter> We found this one area that doesn't have mosquitoes.	24
Yeah,	15
{C so } we see them at least once a week,	24
{C and  then } when you get it completely,  {D you know, } the shell finished, {F uh, }  you still have a lot of stuff to do inside,	24
It is real hard to find a spot	9
<Throat_clearing> Hello.	6
Right,	36
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } as a matter of fact, {F uh, }  my mother was going through some things [ not lon-, +  not long ] ago, {A I guess it has been  a couple of years ago, } <throat_clearing> in an old trunk that she had.	24
Well, I think, if it's, -	9
Yeah.	15
{F um, } we're more -	26
Don't blame you <<very faint>>.	21
<Whistling>.	20
{C because } I looked into picking up some, {F uh, } medical insurance [ for my, + just for my ] family, {D you know, }  [ just, + ] -	24
<laughter> Just wait for you to drive to your house,	24
[ That's, + that's, ] -	26
{F Oh, } yeah.	36
{C but } like you said, [ it's, + it's ]  kind of boring # {D actually. } #	9
I disagree with it,	24
{C and } you can't use the piglets, {D you know, }	24
it's like, once the semester starts I'm the one who has to control how much spending there is.	24
{C And } how much crab meat did you use?	39
Yeah,	36
I'd like to [ try, +  {D you know, } just try ]  something new, every year that, I haven't tried before	24
{C So, } {F um, } I think that that would be [ a real, + a real, ] {F uh, } advantage [ to, + to ] her to have that and, {F uh, } do it early,	9
-- {C because } if they were, then you kind of know that they had to go through some kind of testing, or some kind of something to [ (( be on )) + ] , get an okay seal.	24
I don't think there would be too many  (( left ))  <laughter>.	9
That's true.	21
I've seen pictures,	24
{C so } at the end you had a decorated tree.	24
Yeah.	36
Yeah.	15
I'm not a real big seat belt, -	24
{F Um, } you're not missing anything at the Dallas renovated site.	9
Something is coming out,	2
when P I E [ and, + and ] Ryder went together, why that was downhill from then on, {D you know. } -	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } I think that some of it's over priced.	9
{C And} [you have a, + you have a] earn a right,	9
((   ))  putting two of us through, isn't he lucky.	24
{C and } I'll go in and charge something	24
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh. }   *[[ I'd call this an incomplete slash unit ]] {C So, } you're, -	26
Uh-huh --	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and then } they got more interested in other things,	24
Let me ask you this.	17
{D Well,  } [ that's + that's ] the deal is you're not buying brands now,	3
he's more of [ a, + a ] real tall forward <laughter>.	9
Yeah.	15
<laughter>.	20
she was sentenced to jail	24
one  time we just [ borrowed, + took ] a personal loan and paid off all our credit cards,	24
you don't.	36
{C and, } {F uh, } when the guy came out with the bag they thought was money, it turned out to be a  couple [ cookies,  and,  +  {F uh, } {D you know, } jumbo cookies ]	24
right. #	15
Yeah.	15
# {E I # mean, } [ you, + you ] hate to be paranoid	9
this is the price we're going to give you out the door.	25
it would # be great # -- -- if we could find some way [ to, + to,  ] {F uh, } use that to boost the economy.	9
Yeah.	15
Oh.	15
{D well } Supreme Court, -	9
I've done mostly cross stitching.	24
{F Oh } my gosh.	21
{F Um, } I've got a, {F uh, } small distributorship, {F uh. }	24
I [ miss + ] N P R a lot also.	24
Yeah,	15
it is wonderful,	24
You don't have cable now,	8
{D Well } I usually keep up with news by  watching A B C news on television and  reading the papers here the local DALLAS MORNING  NEWS	24
Yeah,	36
Right.	15
I couldn't do it,	24
Yes.	15
# There's no way that could work. #	9
All that's in it. -	2
{C and } we wanted to have several, -	24
{C and, } {D you know, } people are needing these,	24
#  (( I )) . # -	26
Yeah.	15
{E I mean, } you're not, a-, -	26
that's nice.	21
{C so } I can appreciate it.	24
{C So, } [ he, + he ]  hates the time that he takes,	24
I know [ it was, a, + {D you know, } it was a ] real hot, hot item there.	9
Nice talking to you.	38
I think, let's see, the oldest is thirty-two	24
{C but } I don't know whether, [ [ it, + it, ] + research ] will go on.	24
I've already forgotten, -	24
{C But } even so we had a, {F uh, } {F uh, } -	26
{C and, } {F uh, } this is the first dog I've had all my own as an adult.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
Oh.	26
[ {C and, } + {C but } ] [ it does, + it does ] it's job,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
just recently I got married	24
Maybe the right thing to do is to, {F uh, } <lipsmack> when a couple has a child, <lipsmack> then [ they should both take, + {A you say the first four or five years are the most important, and I think I would agree with that, }  they both take ] four or five years off and devote to parenting.	9
{E I mean } it's, -	26
lot of time spent with her, -	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ We do, + we're  ] ovolacto.	24
At the airport they put us on the wrong bus <inhaling>.	24
{C And } I, -	26
it was just, you couldn't hear half the dialogue because everyone in the audience was # laughing # -- -- # so hard. #	24
Yeah,	4
{C And, } {F uh, } {C so } I did a lot of  talking with friends, with family -- -- with, {F uh, } counselors at high school, and  also read [ some, + some ] books [ on, + on ] the subject [ at the, + at the ] library.	24
-- {C and, } {F uh, } I run a concert band,	24
{C but } what [ if, +  if ] that wasn't the case.	16
{D You know, } every time you do that, it, {F uh, } kind of kills the tree for a while.	24
It doesn't do anyone any good.	9
[ they, + they ] can erase all your others,  {D you know, } because if you have, -	24
they are,	36
Our house in Castroville was the first one, too.	24
{C and } it's more of, {F uh, } seniority, I would imagine kind of thing, instead of having a skill [ or, + or ] whatever to advance,	9
That was good.	24
sometimes, you have all vegetables <laughter>.	24
# That's # a good point.	21
Yeah.	36
{C and then } a couple of hours later I'm home.	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C so } [ they, + they ] thought, okay,	24
# Yeah,	15
{C And then } {D like, }   the week before that, they said go through your cupboards and any food that is still good, bring it in	24
We're not convinced that we're going to be Cowboy fans yet.	24
{F Huh. }  Interesting story.	21
{D Anyway, } have fun exercising.	38
Uh-huh.	15
Oh, geez.	21
I think they should be -- -- randomly drug tested.	9
{C but, } I guess I'll have to say my computer has probably  taken the place of most of my hobbies.	24
Why is that?	39
it's definitely unfortunate <noise>.	9
{C but } up until then,  she's been our substitute kid	24
By the time I was born, even now, {D you know, } women's rights, {F uh, } -	24
Who is that?	39
[ they're, + they're ] got a little wobbly and a little shaky there,	9
I g-, -	26
If you had to pick one, what would you choose?	39
That's discouraging if you own property <laughter>.	9
that's it,	24
{E I mean } I don't know, {F um. }	19
Uh-huh.	15
Yes.	15
{C And } we got, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C So, }  it's nice to be able to play with them and really get to know them.	24
{F Huh. }	15
How did you hear, -	39
sure.	15
About the only thing that really bothers me I don't have that many people coming to my door.	24
{D Well, } they did away with tenure  in teaching along time ago, {D you know, } in the public schools.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
It said on [ the, +  the ] computer, what do I think would be helpful.	24
I thought seriously about joining at  that time,	24
Oh! <Laughter>.	21
yeah.	36
# {F Oh, } I see.  #	29
# Yeah,	15
{C and } that gives me the opportunity to, {F uh, } come in to work and fix it, if I can't think of -- -- some thing to tell the trouble shooter while we're on the phone.	24
We try to work it with their hours.	24
{F Uh, } [ they, + they're ] up there in that mall.  {F Uh, } just below Campbell. Or that [ strip, + strip, ] center.	24
Of course, we didn't really rough it that much.	24
{C and } the little boy must have been, {F oh, } maybe about  ten.	24
Oh, geez.	21
From what I've he-, -	26
Yeah.	15
{C and } you ought to, {D well, }  as your daughters approach the college age, {F uh, } start finding out about the scholarship monies because there is a lot of money out there	18
that looks good.	9
(( When ))  is this good or not good.   *[[listen]]	26
He runs [ a big, +  the largest ]  real estate company in Fort Worth debt free.	24
I thought that was most interesting.	9
they have fifty thousand students there.	24
I don't know h-, <laughter>, -	19
{C and } he took a couple of courses in economics and decided that wasn't, -	24
Yes,	4
That's right <laughter>.	36
That still does it,	22
it isn't,	9
# {F Huh. } #	26
she's, -	26
[ {C and, } + {C and } ]  sometimes it's a struggle.	3
I happened to go to just a little estate sale [ that, + ] # just # a little white frame house, # where # the couple, {F uh, } was very old, # and # had gone into nursing homes	24
I would love to go there.	24
[ I've, +  I doubt  I'll ] be here in six months.	24
{C And } they're saying, hey, we need you to be closer	24
they think that [ I'm, + {D you know, } I'm ] on drugs	24
{F Uh, } {E I mean, } [ that, + that ]  doesn't sound right.	9
I had never heard of them --	24
what do you think of our space budget	31
It's got to be a laboratory that does quality control and double check.	9
{C and } the D Base work I've done was <baby_crying> strictly class related.	24
{F Uh, } we do use them.	24
Yeah.	15
<laughter>	20
of course, you wouldn't think Pillsbury would put out certain chemicals,	24
yeah.	29
If you choose the select top group out of the  public schools and tested them, and then compared them [ to the pri-, + to the private ]  school group, then I think you would have a more equitable -- -- way.	9
That's a very common experience.	9
# Right. #	15
{D so, } [ [ {C and, } + {C and } ] +   {C plus } ] he's getting on in his years now.	24
{C and } # yet Bush did that.	9
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
-- because [ I, + {F uh, } I ] talked to a professor in, {F uh, } what was it, North Carolina, who got [ the, + the ] T I system,	24
Uh-huh,	15
I get the idea that they are maybe [ the, + the  ] more pricier type magazines, as far as women's magazines.	9
They call late,	9
-- {C and } [ something, + {D you know, } something ]  has to be done but just that too many people argue about how to fix it.	9
{D Well } I lived [ down in, + down in ] the bottom of a big hollow	24
{C but } most people that go in to being a physician here in the U S do it for financial gain.	24
{E I mean, } {D you know, } we've gone through this over and over again.	9
yes --	15
<Breathing> {D Well, } sometimes	34
{C and } [ I, + {F uh, } we ] have some doctors at church who said that DOCTOR was just wonderful.	24
-- {C and, } {D well, } {E I mean, } they're very harmonic --	9
[  I had, + I had ] some, {F uh, } -	24
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } I'm glad you did that before your surgery <laughter>.	24
{C So, }  I think that'll be good for work, too.	24
{C But, } {F uh, } like my husband was saying, maybe some of the problems we brought on to ourselves is that these women back in the nineteen fifties, {F uh, } were staying at home with their kids and then made the decision, {D well, } jeez, {D you know, } I'll go out and get a part-time job.	9
-- {C and } we had it perfumed --	24
{C and } they love it.	24
{C but, } {F uh, } yesterday a lady I work with just told me today that, {F uh, } in the state capitol here in Austin, Texas, they had been, {F uh, } looking at a bill, {F uh, } making it easier to accept the bill [ to access, + to access ] handguns	24
you, -	26
What do you think has caused our horrible situation?	39
I just. -	26
# Absolutely.  #	36
I came down March of sixty-nine,  went to work for T and I.	24
[ {C and, } +  {C and } ] [ some people +  ((   ))  {D you know, } we ] think of blessings  as nice furniture and things like that,	9
I don't know,	19
Will they make it through the summer sun?	7
{C And } I thought I was really improving and the big break was going to come	9
Yep.	36
Wow.	21
# Yeah. #	15
Yeah.	15
It can't hurt, <laughter>.	9
[ {C So. } +    *[[slash error]] Yeah,   *[[aa]]	26
In some places they don't.	24
[ You were, + you were ] more ambitious than they would let you be?	7
[ You're in, + you're in  ] the, -	26
{C and, } now because, {F um, } -	24
{C and } it's already dark unless it's summer time, {D you know. }	24
{F Uh, } they've been putting a lot of,  {F uh, } stress on it	24
{C So }   it, {F uh, } -	26
[ {C so } + {C but } ] it's  entertaining	9
Yeah,	3
-- either one of those two, you go through a hundred bucks without half trying,	24
I think maybe there's too much responsibility put on the teachers to motivate these kids.	9
[ If it, + if it's ]  just one more piece of something,	9
Went [ to a, + {F uh, } to a ] Mud Hens double header <laughter>.	24
Oh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
even that's good.	36
what kind of mothers they are, -	24
Yeah.	36
yeah. #	26
{C and } I'm not sure that [ tho-, + those ] programs are available to do that.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Hard rock?	22
Let's just, -	18
I did not get the traction control which also, when you take the [ c-, + traction control ] [ and the + <breathing>, and  the ] suspension thing it also puts heaters in the front seats, too.	24
{C but then } I wouldn't have you,	25
It's just kind of, {F uh, } clou-, -	26
{F Oh, } super.	21
maybe -- -- # I do more than I, -	24
{C But } it really [ keeps -- + -- keeps ] me going.	24
{C and so } it's just a big chunk of money	24
{C or } at least [ it, + it ] wouldn't hurt to switch over there and see if it worked any better,	9
I know I have to do more aerobics,	24
{C and, then } the cover version, [ I think, + {E I mean, } I thought, ] [  was absolutely, + it was pitiful. ]	9
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } how neat. {F Oh, } okay.	21
I think it would be really. really great.	9
At least two of them.	24
{C and } until we got the dog, {F um, } it was real easy [ to, + to ] go to town for [ three d-, + three day ] weekend or whatever,	24
There's too many lawsuits.	9
{C but, } {F uh, } {F Uh, } I don't know if its their proposal or one that's being seriously kicked around.	24
# A baby. #	2
{C and } he wants to be best friends --	24
Used more weapons equal to their chemical weapons that weren't used?	8
It only holds about, -	24
{C And } he had a hundred and four fever.	24
{F Oh, } really?	12
{C so, } they've got some pretty powerful sixes.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } that's what I think we ought to do with the metric system.	9
-- {D like } [ I, + I ] think, {D well, } {F um, } in the morals and values of {D like } my generation [ for the most, + for most ] people are totally different from the morals and [ valleys, + {F um, } values ] of {D like } per se your generation.	9
{F Uh, } there was a company in Houston [ that, + ]	24
{F Oh, } th-, -	26
T I, {D you know, } with [ the, +  the ] whole relaxed atmosphere that we have, {F um, } to all of a sudden, {F uh, }  search for  ((   ))  attitudes and whatnot.	24
{F Uh, } {D you know, } [ I, + when I ] was much  younger, {F uh, } than I am now, [ I, + I ] had wanted to go to the Peace Corps	24
[ W-, + where ] do you work?	39
{F Oh, } # you're kidding <laughter>. #	21
{C But } in the Addison,   {D well } about everything that you could want in Dallas is in the Addison area, anyway.	24
{C but, } [ [ I, + I, ] +  {F uh, } I ] enjoy,	24
This is not one of my better ones.	24
Yes	36
{D So, } I enjoy, {D you know, } cooking things to take over to her house	24
is this open and  shut, {D you know, }  like you were saying,	9
{C And } I just, -	26
Oh!	21
{C so } <laughter> that would be great, if someone came and heard it, and they were like, I want that voice,	24
I belong to a biking club here in Kenosha.	24
{F Oh, } wow.	21
it seems to me it says you are suppose to talk for three minutes,	24
How about yourself?	31
It was just like a heat wave.	24
Do you?	7
Sure.	36
It's, -	26
{F Uh, } firing Tom Landry and hiring Jimmy Johnson	24
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
{C and } we have good friends in England	24
-- yes,	4
he must not of.	9
{C so } we ended up come back down here, and all that, because it helped my husband's work,	24
(( That's huge )) .	9
{F Uh, } {C and } Bobby Ojeda didn't hurt	24
{F Uh, } spend a day and a lot of money <laughter>.	2
[ I, + I ] always think that I'll be able to do it	24
((   ))  they're out of Korea right?	7
Yeah.	15
Okay,  Geri.	13
<Throat_clearing> Yeah.	15
<Throat_clearing>.	20
{C And } when we [ get, + get ] cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above	24
{C and } when I go out to eat dinner sometimes -- -- that's the type of foods I like to find.	24
uh-huh,	15
{C And } I was laughing, going yeah,  right, that's a good practical joke,	24
if you've got a pretty good [ rating, + {F uh, } credit rating ] -- -- you can call [ [ your in-, + {D you know, } [ your, + your ] card, ] + wherever you got your card from ] and tell them, hey,  either drop my rates -- -- or drop my, {D you know, } {F uh } -- -- annual fees or I'll just go to somewhere else.	24
# I agree. #	36
I'm building, {F uh, } one.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Right,	15
((   )) .	20
Okay.	38
{C And } you are supposed to feel safe,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Do you think they should spend more?	7
Yeah.	15
Really?	12
I have relatives that direction.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C so } maybe it's the law that wrong in their eyes	9
It spilled over  into, {F uh, } now I can't even think of the country.	24
I was kind of wondering if they would be collecting people with, {F uh, } the western accents or something like that.	24
{C But } then heat them thoroughly in the sauce itself	18
I'm twenty-eight.	24
Yeah.	15
We found one restaurant we were in <breathing> and got seated,	24
uh, which is a shame because you go to other countries, uh,	9
I just, {F oh, } -	26
the ticker tape parade and all that.	2
{D you know, } how do you decide.	16
there is [ a -- + -- a ] big difference in the, {F uh, }  economic, {F um, } status of, {F uh, } people although I think that has been true, {F uh, } always.	9
{C So } we trucked in, {F uh, }	24
it's too much involvement --	25
<Laughter> {F Uh, } that's a tough question -- -- how to fix the school system.	24
{F Uh, }	26
finally, it's my first summer movie <laughter>.	24
{C but } [ it's, + it's ] really nice to see them because, -	24
Uh-huh.	15
I don't care what you say,	24
# {C And } I # love the water aerobics.	24
{C and } I was like ugh.	24
[ I'm getting me, + {F uh, } I ] want a German Shepherd.	24
{F Uh } <noise>.	15
<Laughter> I'm a dog lover.	24
as a matter of fact, I was thinking that same thing, unconditional love.	24
this week, -	26
You think so <laughter>?	7
{C And } I was born in Ohio,	24
with, {F uh, } -	26
I guess I haven't seen that as much in this area, although every now and then you hear about it.	24
they have to have a certain respect for it.	9
Is that right?	12
[ I, + I ] remember it when I was younger [ of, + ] {D you know, } catching it on P B S,	24
{E I mean, } {C and } [ they have, + they have ] some serious chemicals out there -- -- {D you know, }	24
Uh-huh.	15
<<Pause>> {C But, } {F uh, } like you said, [ it's, + it's ] not the best system,	9
# {C And } # -- -- I think they're eliminating [ that, + {F uh } -- -- # that ] loophole.	9
Uh-huh. #	4
{C and, } {F Oh } yeah,	26
{C and } most of it, {D you know, } -	26
It sure does.	11
{C and } you think that can't possibly be done,	9
that's probably, # {D you know, } [ what she, + what she ] wants anyway	24
{C and, } -	26
# {C because, } # {F uh, } -	26
I love the food.	24
"(( I said )) , ""Well, how's your brother doing?"""	24
Right.	15
Yeah.	15
{C And so } he brought me up from like a hundred and fifteen, I had my high game of two eighty-seven.	24
{D You know, } I was like God Almighty,	24
[ We, + we ] live out in the country.	24
Um.	15
We just dropped it down there	24
{C and, } {F uh, } I would, {F uh, } collect the corn very carefully, ear by ear,	24
# {C and } # there's no other real shut off valves inside the house,	24
Uh-huh.	15
I don't know, {F uh, } how a few bucks can be worth shooting somebody	24
I see.	29
# and # they have little conversations and things.	24
Four in a row.	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C But } those are my criteria,	24
We've only lived here a couple of years.	24
{E I mean, } I like, {D you know, } [ things + ] {D like } to hear, {D you know, } what they call world music.  Which is, {D you know, } using all these natural forms of music	9
#  you can fix just about everything and anything.	2
it is.	24
I had, {F uh, } some visitor	24
that's true.	36
{D Well, } yeah,	4
{F Uh, } that use to be I think a couple of years ago,	9
I would love to hold her.	25
And you ask the right questions and can research,	24
{C or, } -	26
Right.	15
I was never that brave	24
{C or } they hadn't really roughed it up or whatever [ they, + ]	24
Yeah,	36
Really.	12
{C and, } {F uh, } when you have time to do it <laughter>.	24
{C and } maybe  we'll meet up again some time.	38
{C so } I'm doing a lot of writing	24
At Georgia Tech.	24
{C Or } probably even baby-sitters would be the same thing.	9
he said, {F um, } [ he should have let, +  Bush should have let ] him finish his job.	24
Yeah,	15
for one thing.  I know their, work, {D you know, }	24
{C but } [ that's, + <breathing> that's ] one of the things I [ don't, + don't ] understand [ is, + is ] so much of the controversy	24
What are you interested in in restaurants?	39
{C So } <laughter> we were kind of pitiful.	24
Because you get set in your ways	9
My husband works for T I.	24
I, -	26
it's a good idea,	9
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } whenever something happens it's, you made me hit that,	24
Oh.	15
[ that's a-, + -- -- that's all ] I've seen in offices, is I B M.	24
{E I mean, } [ I, + I ] suppose [ that, + that ] it's difficult to really say why because, {F uh, } {D you know, } [ there, + there ] probably are a limited number of women who are interested in the subject and well qualified.	9
{C And, } {D you know, } we need to solve these international problems	9
it was amazing what I found out I could do on my own if I just put my mind to it.	24
<Laughter>.	20
Okay,	13
{C so } that, -	26
{C and } sometimes you get discounts with the cards	24
[ I d-, + I don't ] know either.	19
You serve that yourself, or [ the, + for ] a family?	7
{C but } it's not practical for me,	24
{C and } I'm sure a lot of people come  to, {D you know, } small colleges also but just that they're more [ of, + of ]  the different cultures there,	9
{F Oh, } okay,	29
{C and so, } -	26
That's what people said, #	24
{D You know. }  {C And then } you can put him on trial.	24
{D Well, } me being from Texas <laughter>, -	24
D-, -	26
yeah.	4
Yeah,	36
bye now <TV>.	38
{C And } all on the job, too.	24
{F Oh, } okay.	29
okay?	7
Uh-huh,	15
one of the  things that rubs me the wrong way the most is those programs that are funded by Congress  and, {F uh, } that don't seem to have any validity at all.	9
{C and } the U. S. didn't go in there and try to save those people.	9
{C and } I don't have to worry about,  {D you  know, } what's current and what's not because I haven't been  current with music for a long time.	24
[ We'd have to + we'd have to ] build less prisons, {D you know, } less police force.	9
{F Oh } uh-huh.	15
They'll take it and refinance it and  put it with Texas Credit Union at I think it's a ten and a quarter percent. Which is not a bad deal.	24
Right <laughter>.	15
{D Well, } I don't know,	19
There's really, -	26
I'm not sure.	34
Yeah,	4
{C and, } {D you know, } [ they're, + they're, ] -	26
we need enough help here in this country.	9
Oh.	15
{C but, } boy there's a lots going on in there <laughter>.	9
This is pretty well where L B J  and Audelia, Skillman -- -- cross.	24
{C and } [ [ there, + there, ] + there ] are no buses.	24
Yeah.	15
I've had a regiment now for about,  {D you know, } ten, fifteen years [ of, + of ] doing that	24
{D Well, } that's thought,	24
{D Well, } do you exercise regularly, Judy?	7
<Noise> {C And, }  it's a daily thing for her.	24
that's right.	36
definitely.	36
Is it?	7
{F Oh, } okay.	29
Yeah.	4
-- {C and } I'm in active reserve now,	24
-- [ they, + they ] keep me busy	36
{C But } you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes.	9
{C But } I can't do it, {D you know, } working full-time	24
Yeah,	4
{F Um, } she's, {F um, } a mix of [ [ Cockapoo, + Cock-,  ] + Cocker  ] Spaniel and Poodle.	24
{C But, }  I wasn't embarrassed to shop around {D you know, } <laughter> --	24
I tell you if I could have gotten a hold of that cat that day.	24
{C So } <laughter>, -	26
Retired, {C but. } -	24
{F Oh, } okay.	15
# Uh-huh. #	15
[ unless you, +   unless you ] have some vacation time or [ some, +  some ] sick leave or whatever, {F um, } you kind  of have to finagle your way around to get that time.	9
that's possible.	40
{C And } they distribute them to the people, that need them.	24
Huh-uh.	33
<Laughter> Okay.	15
-- starts out when they're small and  continues through generations --	24
It's good.	24
Unfortunately that will probably even drop lower,  the voters turndown,  (( ))  even more because more Democrats will think that they don't have a shot	9
Which, {F uh, } -	26
We send a lot of money to Mexico.	9
{C So, } [ It, + it ] ought to be a real interesting play-off.	9
{C so } [ that's, +  that's ] good.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Right,	36
Yes,	36
{C And } I really think that that's one of the problems the nation's facing that, {D you know, } we need to do something about,	9
Right.	15
Without a doubt.	9
I heard it on the radio.	24
Uh-huh.	4
<Door>  Especially around bonus time.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
{C so } that's kind of how I got in with the football.	24
I'm trying to do something about my cholesterol in the same way.	24
{D So, } I grew up with a lot of his music,   [ and, +  and ] what not.	24
{D Well, } you should, {F uh, } run for a school board position.	18
-- {C but } [ it really, + it ] does get good gas mileage.	24
right.	36
{C and } wouldn't I like to have her money --	16
{C and } it was talking about opera,	24
Yeah,  {F oh, }	15
I have a little turkey left from a passover [ [ whi-, + whi-, ] + which ] was in April.	24
Uh-huh,	15
Yeah,	15
{C but, } {F uh, } in the meantime we pray over our food because I'm always looking down my plate	24
basically.	24
# {F Oh, } yeah.	36
{C but } we're on a corner lot,	24
[ It, + it ] takes their minds off [ of, + of ] trying to compete.	9
{C so } I'm looking for the easy way out.	24
They don't kill them,	5
{C And } I haven't bought a REDBOOK in a while <noise>,	24
How old are you?	39
Probably [ o-, + {F uh, } about ] twenty.	24
I had heard other people talk about what they thought he believed in.	24
Yeah.	4
[ O-, + {C or } ] you could do it just for fun, {D you know, } kind of like a game,	9
Ye-, -	26
-- {C so } there're lots and lots of  them available in the paper at [ any, +  any ] week,	24
I don't think so,	5
I felt that this was a company that should have been more reliable --	24
yeah,	36
{F Oh, } yeah,	15
if I went outside while he was mowing the grass, I was going to have a gigantic attack.	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ that's, + that's ] what ours are too.	24
{D Well } just recently in the  paper here, were articles about students, {F uh, } working.  High school students -- -- that work and the percentage  of hours that they work and how that affects their grades.	24
They're always saying that somebody's  going to,	24
Just sun exposure?	7
Yeah.	15
{F Um, } we're supposed to talk about television	18
Yeah.	15
{F Uh, } gee.	21
What is your, {F uh, } community, {F uh, } currently doing with regard to recycling?	39
That's nice.	21
Yeah.	30
it's just being able to lay out the material and measure it -- -- because you need so much room.	9
Oh, I see.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } with [ have + ] little regulation going on  because of deregulation during the Reagan eight years, {F uh, } more and more S and  L simply began to take riskier and riskier loans	24
<noise>.	20
{F Um, } {F um, } Brookshires up in  {F uh, } Allen, {F uh, } you bring [ your bags back, +  {D you know, } [ they, + ] {F uh, }  the plastic bags back ] or the paper bags, you put them in the receptacles there, -	24
[ {C so, } + {C and } ]  the locus trees have like three quarters of an inch thorns on it.	24
I really did --	24
and I left there on a Saturday afternoon just totally exhausted.	24
{F Oh } yeah.	15
{C and, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
[ I, + I ] think, that, [ that, + that's ]  a terrible thi-, {D you know, } -	9
Yeah.	15
Is it, {F uh, }	12
<Laughter>.	20
<Laughter>.	20
[ I, + I ] guess, {D you know, }  I'd like you to maybe express something here.	18
<Noise> <laughter> Okay.  <Breathing>	13
Yeah	15
<laughter> {E I mean, } I hope I don't get like that when I get old.	24
{F Oh, } okay.	29
No.	36
{D well } it was nice talking with you.	38
{C and } they never saw each other again.	24
{C and } I, -	26
{D well, } we've got a compatible.	24
I definitely, -	26
{F Uh, } {C and } I [ have, + have ] done fairly well at them.	24
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and, } ] {D you know, } {F uh, } I suppose, {F uh, } years ago, way back [ when, + {F uh, } when, ] {F uh, } they had the revolutionary war and people decided that they, {F uh, } were fed up with the government, {F uh, } -	9
<Laughter>.	20
I don't keep up with it that often.	24
Do you think it is necessary to have the federal guaranty program	7
[ I think, + I think ] the tendency is that as people get older, # and # gain, [ I don't want, + I don't want ] to say more responsibility, but  {D you know, } things like homes and kids, # and # so forth. They tend to lose that liberalism they had when they were younger.	9
-- {C or } she can go down to the cafeteria?	35
Bye <Children> <TV> <noises> <<kitchen sounds in background>>.	38
{C and } again dad went through the whole thing,	24
{F Oh, } yeah?	12
I could probably plant one and bring it in, [ and + ] just like I bring my plants in every year.	24
my wife handles a lot of the day to day finances	24
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
I agree.	24
{C so } I don't know what was decided.	24
I happen to [ r-, + just read ] something the other day at least in the Boston paper there were three things [ that, + that ] come to note.	24
Right.	15
{C So, }  I think about the only one is, {F uh, } rape,	9
{C And } he is still living by himself.	24
[ [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] + {F uh, } {C so } ]  this creates a pretty serious problem that's going to continue to be with us for a while to come.	9
{C and } our daughter watches her pennies so closely, that <sigh> [ she almost, +  she almost, ]  just sounds like your father,	24
Yes.	36
See, that's ridi-, -	26
{C but } I have a opportunity to go to, {F uh, } Paris, France, {F uh, }  [ with, + {F uh, } with ] my friend in April.	24
{C So } it was really sad, [ jus-, + ]  {D you know } that a lot of families, {F um, } [ have to, +  {D well, } {D you know, } have to ]  have dual income.	9
I guess you can classify them all together.	9
Yeah <laughter>.	15
[ {C And, } + {C and }  ] I don't know what the high rank is for the gals	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
that's true, <laughter>	36
That's wonderful.	21
# Uh-huh # <<very faint>>.	15
{C and } passing the law depends on how heavy [ the car industry, + the automobile lobby ] is.	9
{D Well, } they pushing the death penalty?	7
<Laughter> Yeah,	36
# I # think it's probably more true, still [ in the, + in the ] smaller communities -- -- then in the larger cities.	9
Uh-huh.	15
extra -- -- {C because } {D actually, } to me, credit cards are the same as cash,	24
{D Well, } in the, {F uh, } newer neighborhoods and development communities, the houses are so close together,	24
and they come home	24
Uh-uh,	36
{C And, } {D you know, } a third of the Texas market with its millions of kids is a heck of a lot of textbooks.	24
he's on A M,	24
Yeah.	4
{D see } the thing is that they give support to the financial planner that they're the assistant to, or that they usually have several people they report to [ that, + {D you know, }  that ] they work -- -- together with -- -- it encourages them not to, {F uh, } complain when they realize that they get a part [ of the, + of the ] action based on their efforts and not based on being sitting back saying, {D well } make me do it.	9
I guess that has changed also.	9
That's really, -	26
{C and, } {F um, } usually we just have very plain kind of, {D you know, } [ interesting, + not very interesting  ] meals. Pizza and that  (( all	24
and said something here when I came home and French to somebody	24
{E I mean, } [ I think, + I think ] the only I've ever seen a sequel was TWO THOUSAND AND ONE.	24
{C and } there was nowhere else to take them	24
Yeah.	15
Exactly.	36
{F Oh, } yeah,	15
{C and } they don't look a thing a like.	24
{D You know, } I think it's one of those things where it's not viewed upon as being professional.	9
The war that just went on.	24
We rented that one, too.	24
Yeah.	15
{C but, } {D you know, } now it's like, {D you know, } they're doing good so everybody's forgotten <laughter> about that.	24
And, uh, -	26
my husband does, too,	24
# Yeah. #	15
I cook most of the time because I, -	24
[ [ I, + I'm, ] + I ] work in the legal department	24
Paris.	24
A worm?	7
{C So } {E I mean, } it's your choice where  you want to go,	24
the cease-fire.	24
Right.	36
<Clicking> <talking> {F Uh, } I don't know.	13
{D well, } [ you'd have to, {F uh, } + {E or } I would have to ] say, {D you know, } someone like Montana, I guess, who's done so well for so many years.	9
# {E I # mean, } I got probably the biggest,	24
{C And } it's very, very, -	26
<laughter> {C but, }  {F uh } -- -- I think unrestricted immigration, I think,  [ is not, + {F uh, } is not ] best, {F uh. }	9
[ {C And, } + {C and  } ] they're trying to think of what's a Troy ounce.	24
Yeah.	4
That's a good question.	17
# Uh-huh. #	15
How many music boxes do you have?	39
{C So, } I don't know.	24
{C and } [ we were, + {F uh, } we just decided ] that we would do it	24
it's not that bad of a life as it should be -- -- [ b-, + ] for the punishment aspect.	9
{C so. } {F Uh, } [ do yo-, + d-, ] -	26
Yeah,	15
Part time.	30
true.	36
I'm, -	26
don't you feel like most people have given up on the rehabilitation idea?	7
[ they, + they ] think that's a  lot of fun.	24
{D Well. } -	26
Right.	15
{C and } {F um, } that's really what makes the most sense,	9
{C but, } {F uh, } [ they, + they ] really are nice cars, [ there, + there, ]	24
{C But } {D you know, } {D like } in Minnesota, they've got their bins where you put plastics and your bottles.	24
{D Well, } {F uh, } <swallowing> as far as the practical aspects go, I suspect that the space station may actually be a good compromise -- -- between, {D you know, } [ deep space + <<mispronounced>>, {E I'm sorry, } deep space + ] exploration -- -- [ and, + {F uh, } and  ] not doing anything -- -- because we have the opportunity to off load some things to the space station.	24
I don't know, I guess, -	19
# I spent, # twenty years as a mechanic	24
{D You know, } a particular institution might be better -- -- for my area --	9
Got to wait a couple years.	18
Oh.	15
{C but } I agree with you, that probably is not what was comprehended.	36
they don't get special  treatment and maybe they should, {D you know } -- -- because we're all going to get old someday.	9
I have not been over there	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well } that means you're going to put them in a cage you think it's never ever going to be safe for them to walk the streets again,	9
Let's see if I can remember it,	17
They don't want you to tell them what to do.	24
Yeah.	15
Harrison Ford.	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ it's, + it's ] the most beautiful thing that happens between a mother and a child. The first, like say, six, years of life.	9
Huh-uh.	15
[ It, +  {F uh, } it, ]  {F uh, } {D you know, } -	26
[ it's just, + it just is ] almost overwhelming sometimes when you think, # [ of, + of ] the # jobs that is out there to be done, # in order to flip # things back around the way they needed to be,	9
one, -	26
{D Well } like I was saying, Burlington's crime, it doesn't involve children	24
Yeah.	15
isn't it?	23
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah <static>.	15
{C and } Senator Moynihan's, {F uh, } proposal [ [ to, + to, ] + to ] cut there  I think [ wou-, + makes ] a lot of sense.	9
<Laughter> {F Oh, } {D well, } what kind of paint did you use for the, {F um, } bookends?	39
Do you ever keep any of your stuff?	7
{C And } what are you doing?	39
Okay.	15
we actually had a little baby -- -- {C so } I'm taking a little bit of a time off from work.	24
{D You know, } it's just incomprehensible,	9
{C But }  [ she, + she [ is constantly, + was, ] ] I guess because, -	26
(( )).	20
good to hear.	15
{F Oh, } my word.	21
[ not, + not ] really, {F um, }	24
{C so } [ I'm, +  I'm ] same generation.	24
There are places that have a lot of things for them to do.	24
I enjoy doing it on a limited basis.	11
Yeah.	15
[ If you, + if they ] make you an offer, then they'll test you right before you start.	24
How about your family?	31
{C And } the man said, that, {D you know, } if it weren't for the fact that he would go to jail, that he would eliminate this person himself. And then go to McDonalds and have a hamburger and not [ thing a thing, + think a thing ] about it.	24
{C and } I, in the past, have done a great deal [ of, + of, ] {F uh, } system development just through, {F uh, } software development programming.	24
Exactly.	36
{D Well, } {F uh, } I don't have any strong  convictions about it,	24
Uh-huh.	15
<Lipsmack>  # Yeah. #	36
{C but } Chinese isn't my favorite	24
{F Uh, } [ what, + {F uh, } what ] sort.	39
College freshman, [ I, + ] college coed.	24
{D So. } -	26
{C because } I think he'd like that one.	24
{D Well, } that's what my husband, -	24
Right.	15
all you got to do is go cash those things	24
I would, {F uh, } tend to agree with you that there is a problem <swallowing>.	24
Right,	36
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] I haven't had too many  problems with my car,	24
{D well }  [  we're, + we are ]  on the dry side of the mountains.	24
if it's exercise, it's a task.	24
Yeah.	15
I just, I think it's a bigger risk than ... -	9
Yeah.	15
Was for tuna fish. -	24
you couldn't be inconspicuous, when you walked into a store  (( stuff ))  like that,	24
my son was in the second grade,	24
I'm the same way <laughter>.	24
[ Is that -- + -- is that ] correct,	7
{C so, } I kind of kept up with a lot of things that went on.	24
{C So, } -	26
Okay.	15
{D actually, } I'm excited, tomorrow I have a, {F uh, }  (( luncheon ))   appointment with a perspective client to do, # {F uh, } # marketing communications for them.	24
Central.	15
#Uh-huh.#	15
{C But, }  {F uh, } doing a mix of Nautilus and  free weights.  # I like that. #	24
I think, -	26
take the job.	24
not quite a few, several, in Latin America.	24
# Gosh. #	21
Anyone can go and vote.	24
Great.	21
Okay.	15
{F Uh, } he plays one of the main characters	24
{F Uh, } I don't know that they yet have the facilities here to do the tin cans.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
{C So }  I just cut the leaves off and  transplant and put some other plants down.   Because I want them to come back up next year.	24
Uh-huh,	15
Big roomy trunk --	24
I, I read to them a lot.	24
{F um, } anything like that [ is, + is ]  a, {F uh, } major undertaking  I guess, {F uh, }	24
-- {C and so } when I go to his office or to other clients' offices, then I'll dress up --	24
Yeah.	36
I, {F uh, } weight train, {F uh, } three days on and one day off.	24
{C And so } we've got both of those budgeted	24
<Child_yelling>.  Yes <laughter>.	36
yeah.	26
We're starting our kids a little bit early.	24
{F Uh, }	26
{C and } I don't know what we pay for his card,	24
{C But, } {F uh, } other than that,  [ I, +  I ] don't have too many parties.	24
[ {C And, } +  {C and } ] also  the suspension can be raised for driving, like in the ice and  snow.	24
-- it does kind of get in the, -	26
I can believe that.	21
They don't understand that to make that work,	9
(( no,	32
my tomatoes are two and a half feet tall --	24
I know that the problems are so deep.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } I don't know how we're going to  do that right away though,	24
[ It, + it, ] -	26
# Yeah.  #	15
{D You know, } if someone is something more than a social drinker, shall we say, yet, they're not an alcoholic, what do you do?	16
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } they lived, {D you know, } -	24
Yeah,	36
{C and } [ I, +  you ] sort of forget how much it did rain	24
{D You know, }	26
Yeah.	15
{F Um. }	26
yeah.	36
{C So } we said the next time around we'd get <laughter> something little that if -- -- something happened, it would be easier to carry.	24
{C So, }  {E I mean, } [ it's, + it's ] kind of a bad time to be a slave to your credit cards.	9
All my friends, [ they, + their ] parents worked all the time,	24
Uh-huh.	15
((   ))  I felt like we're going in and taken all [ their, +  {F um, } their ] gold or oil, or bananas or coffee or anything like that,	24
I've never heard anything about this before.	25
{D You know, } either wanting to clean our carpet, sell us storm windows, -	24
yeah.	15
{F Uh, } {D anyway } I just, -	26
{F Um, } [ I haven't, + I haven't ] gotten too terribly much into my major yet.	24
you just sort of,  -	26
{C So, } That is right.	26
I'm, {F uh, } twenty-seven.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Ours finally disintegrated.	24
That's true,	36
{C and } now I guess, {D you know, } being in my forties,  I just kind of mellowed out a little bit.	24
{C and } that's why it's a good idea to get a wide variety of  coverage so that you get a lot of different opinions.	9
{C And }  if we do take out a loan on a house in the future, what we'll do is pay [ twice a, +   twice a ] month on it, [ and, + ] because you save a lot in interest, just doing that.	24
<Laughter>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
these people are supposedly, I guess waiting to die,	9
# <Laughter>  Oh, gosh.  #	21
{C But } I would forget to write the things down	24
yeah	26
[ {C So, } + {C but } ] usually I just opt for brownies and vanilla ice cream <laughter> <cough> <static>.	24
No.	33
-- I know it affected me when I was younger.	24
She's got a very nice temperament.	24
Right now both the MasterCard and  the Visa, we don't have to pay a yearly fee on	24
{C So } we'll make [ something, + ] {D you know, } {F uh, } some sort of pasta or something, # {D you # know, } homemade pasta or lasagna or something.	24
{C and } it would put [ a, + {D you know, } a ] lot of the tax attorneys our of business	9
yeah.	26
Is it good education?	16
I see.	21
Thanks.	38
One parent.	30
{F Um, } my sense is that something may  just have been done about it by congressmen  ((   ))	24
they don't have anybody to depend on,	9
Yes,	36
He wrote books that were, {D like, }  pretty short and  pretty easy to read, {D you know, } {D like } written at a third grade level or whatever.	24
Uh-huh.	15
# {C And } # the water in  (( Medina ))  Lake and that area was really going down, that they were considering that they might have to do water rationing	24
{D well, }   what I don't like about, {F uh, } [ sentence, +    the jury doing the sentencing ] -- -- in that I think it becomes a lot less, -	9
{D well, } we don't either,	24
{F Uh, } I should knock on wood.	24
Yeah.	36
{D So, } who's your, {F uh, } favorite team?	39
that was more my specialty, I suppose.	24
That is about all I want <laughter>.	24
{D Well, } that is interesting.	21
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } it, -	26
{F Oh, } really?	12
{F Uh, } [ I, + I ] guess I like the shows that really have a real sense of, {F uh, } I don't know, honesty or sort of a purity value, I guess.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
wouldn't it.	7
Yeah,	4
Really?	12
Right.	15
[ Mississippi probably doesn't, + Mississippi probably doesn't  ] have to worry too much <laughter>.	9
# I # can't quite remember the year.	19
-- {C but, }  when we first moved to Coppell, {A it's what, six years ago, } we didn't even have a grocery store --	24
{F Oh, } that has to be terrible over there.	9
[ What, + {D now } what ] night is that on {D now? }	39
Uh-huh.	15
[ It, + it ] drives just wonderfully	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh } my.	21
# {F Oh, } really. #	15
I think it's a fairly clean city compared to some,	24
{C so } we are just. -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C and, } {F um, } I've, -	26
I think that'll be fun.	9
No,	33
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
{F Uh, } now [ I, + I ] don't know who the characters are,	24
Yes,	36
the one trend I would say is that with so many more women choosing professional careers, there are fewer of them home in the afternoons,	9
What next?	16
{C but, } {F uh, } {F oh } boy.  [ [ He was, + {F uh, } {F uh, } he, ] + he gave ] [ the, + the ] best response that I've heard him give of this type of movie for RAIN MAN.	24
right.	36
# {C but } # [ I think that, + {F um, } # I  jus-, # ] -	26
yeah,	4
they're getting a kind of a, attitude of, # not, # -	26
Let's see what else is on television.	18
Yeah. {F Huh } <sigh>.	15
{C and } he just loves it.	24
yeah.	15
{D like } if they're on [ tr-, + {F uh, } trial  ] for rape, [ you can't have any, + you can't ] bring up the sexual assaults and stuff, or whatever.	9
I don't know anything about it.	24
I think he can probably raise taxes and still get elected.	9
{D Well, } I'm divorced,	24
Changes, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{D well } it's, -	26
{C but } you're <talking> wondering  [ my, + ] when you put down all the money that you do bring in -	9
{C but, }  {F uh, }  it was pretty, -	26
She has two little boys.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I belong to the user's group	24
something that we can just cook in a hurry after we get off work.	24
<<silence>> three eight six twenty-five C maybe	24
{C and } we'd go down there	24
It -	26
{D Well, } there's a lot of [ s-, + stuff ] going on in Arlington these days.	9
{C and } she's really cracking down on restrictions and what goes on in nursing homes.	24
That's terrible.	21
You don't have to have watched it last week in order to follow,	24
{C or } why are we so fascinated with the other world.	16
{C So } do you do, -	7
{D Well, } people aren't willing to pay those  prices very often, {D so, } {D you know, } for a handcrafted  something,	9
Yes,	36
That's a sharp looking car.	9
Wow <laughter>.	21
# What do you serve with it? #	39
Now the part about sewing that  I never liked was laying out the material and the pattern and cutting it out.	24
{D You know, } they always offer credit cards for college students.	24
She's four --	24
Yeah,	15
{C and } that's about it down here,	9
# Uh-huh. #	15
# <Laughter>.  #	20
[ it's, + it's ] just too blown out of proportion for everyone.	24
there are four of them who live here in Texas, and his mom and dad.	24
{F Oh, } we had a frog strangler go  [ sw-, +  sweeping through here, {F uh, } yesterday  and last night.	24
Right.	36
[ I, +  I ] think so.	9
<laughter>.	20
my husband was transferred around, {F uh, } up to Minnesota and now back to Texas with T I --	24
I know our grass needs mowing twice as often <laughter> -- -- when it rains --	24
I do think that in the Middle East  war, {F um, } -	26
that's true,	36
{C So, } that's what I ended up going for is for business.	24
-- {F uh, } {C but } what you can't learn, {F uh, }  on a job, is a good solid [ well-, + well-rounded ] education.	24
{F Uh, } what are your feelings?	31
{D Well, } it's desert, {D you know, }	24
{C But } {D now, } I enjoy it every once  in a while,	24
the dog is probably [ about, + about ] thirteen, fourteen years old.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but, } {F uh, } {D you know, } we have to go through the same thing,	24
{C And } it would have nothing to do with political  situations.	9
You ever heard of Boise?	7
Yes,	36
{C but } I didn't recognize the name.	24
Yes.	4
-- {F um, } [ and, + and ] things like that.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Oh.	15
{C And } we may have to do it out of necessity as far as moving that time schedule up.	9
{D Well, } one of  my favorites if I don't want to have other people bring stuff, I just want to treat them is -- -- to make chicken and rice.	24
We're going to be teaching him what we can at home, of course, because, {F uh, } I guess we don't trust the school system, which is very sad, {F uh, }	24
Yeah,	4
that's scary.	21
{C But } when you actually, really are given as much choice as you are in this country, with its two party system, {F um, }	9
{D Well, } good,	21
the perceived decline, has to do with, {F uh, } {F um, } the attitudes and  the educational system, {F uh, }	9
Ooh.	15
# You buy # the [ canned baked, + canned baked ] beans?	7
[ {C and } -- + -- {C but } ] he has some real fond memories of marching band -- -- and concert band type activities,	24
Woo.	21
I do to	36
I don't know	34
{C and } short of putting nails through it, we can't get it back on,	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } it was really hard on everyone.	24
{D You know, } some people will go shopping in Mesquite at the malls out there, {F uh, }	24
I don't know exactly what that is,	24
{D Well, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C and, } {D you know, } it's like [ you're, + {E I mean, } employments are ] contractual by nature anyway --	24
{C Because, } [ i-, + if ] you have, {D well, } -	26
{E I mean, } I read a lot for school,	24
{C and } he got to do it	24
he was raised on a farm in southern Ohio, near Dayton.	24
Hot?	14
{C and, so, } [ I, + I ] kind of don't pay a proportionate amount of taxes [ to, + ] I guess, {F uh, } compared to what I get, because [ I, + ] {D you know, } all [ my, + my ] education is state sponsored.	24
Uh-huh.	15
You spend what you have	2
We're both, {F uh, } -	24
Huh-uh.	15
{C So } -- -- that's why we call her Liberty.	24
# Yes. #	15
if, -	26
It, it, -	26
{D Well, } basically I like comedy shows <laughter>. {F Uh, } MURPHY BROWN, {F uh, } DESIGNING WOMEN  ((   )) .	24
[ Murder, + murder ] [ is, + is ] hard on the people that were related to -- -	9
{C And } it's real easy to do,	24
<Laughter> Yeah.	15
# Uh-huh.  #	15
Uh-huh.	15
after you get to like five hundred degrees, the higher it gets the more complete the combustion is.	24
-- {C but } puts a lot of strain on things.	24
we were able to have that [ pretty, +   pretty ] effortlessly.	24
I was one of the forced ones <laughter>.	24
{F Um. }	15
[ [ [ They, + they, ] + my, ] + my ] older son is at Columbia in New York  City,	24
they always {C either } have <breathing> -	9
yeah,	15
{C and } what they were pleading was, {F um, } they were pleading insanity.	24
no telling,	24
That's about what it was.	36
Yeah.	15
{C and } we don't see the sun	24
Uh-huh.	15
# [ some did, + {F uh, } # some did, ] {D you know, } Big Brother, Big Sister, stuff like  that.	24
{C so } they were trying to start that  out,	24
{C So } what do you think of the Texas weather?	39
Uh-huh,	36
Uh-huh.	15
Ooh,	15
{F Um, } {D you know, } he would come home	24
I think a lot of people are panicked,  how kids are turning out and how things are going for kids and realizing they've got to start  doing something.	9
Must have been Thursday, {F uh, }	24
{C So, } [ in, + in, ] -	26
{C So, } it's true.	9
{C so. } -	26
{D Well, } what do you think [ is, + is ] the major social change?	31
Uh-huh.	15
I know that.	24
{D You know, } they had the # Merv # --	24
(( )) new houses that I've seen.	24
when he was in high school, he enjoyed going to baseball games.	24
Yes	15
{D well, } yeah	19
Oh.	15
{C And } you really have to be able  to type pretty fast [ before, + {D you know, } before ]  it really saves time.	9
# Uh-huh. #	15
{C And } other than that I, -	26
No,	33
I've never done a canoe trip.	24
You grew up with his children, too, then?	8
They've essentially made up a list of, {F uh, } {F oh, } all the different,  {F uh, } medical maladies that you can have -- -- and then basically made a cutoff,	24
Not everybody has a picture perfect body.	9
-- {C and } [ it, + it ] didn't even hardly -- -- go through,	24
Uh-huh.	15
that  [ {C or, } +  {C or, } ] {F uh, } the other extreme,	9
No.	33
Yeah,	15
they just get bugs in them.	24
<static> [ it, + it ]  seems like it's [ gone, + ] gotten carried away,	9
{C and } you change your mind,	9
{C But, }  {F uh, } {F uh, } like I said, we're [ getting, + <talking> getting ] the kids ready to go to the birthday <noise> party,	24
next month, -	26
{C But } I,  ((   )) , -	26
{C and} had time to do anything about it.	9
I do not.	24
<Laughter>.	20
uh-huh.	4
[  What, + what ] part of the country are you from?	39
I didn't think that anybody had those at all yet.	9
{C But } she was probably depressed to begin with.	9
now we're doing it on a, city wide basis [ in, + in  ] communities.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
Right.	15
{C and, } {F um, } {C so, } it was quite popular.	24
<Laughter> This is supposed to be [ the, + the ] guy that's, {F uh, } replaces   Bruce Lee or whatever [ or, + or ] the next Chuck Norris type of guy.	24
{C or } just, -	26
{C And } I guess we'd better get back to work, {F huh. }	38
I sat there,	24
{C so } # -- -	26
[ it just, + I ] don't really care much for T V at all.	24
{D well, } still taking care of the children is a very important job.	9
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	15
{C And } they're okay.	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ I-, +  my fiancee and I ] both figure that's what's, we're going to end up with both  of the parents or  whoever.	24
Really.	15
{C But } again [ it's, + ] I initiate it not the company.	24
{F Uh, } that seems like a long time for news	9
A-, -	26
[ {C And } I, + {C and } I ] imagine that [ it's, + ((   ))  {D you know, } it ] just feeds upon itself when we have this sort of violence in society,	9
Uh-huh.	15
You can still [ get, + get, ] {F uh, } even [ the, + the ] low end wagons, {F um, }  for less than twenty thousand dollars --	24
<Child_talking>.	20
-- {F um. }	26
How about you?	31
<Noise> <<like water running>> You know what scares me too, is that we have yet to see [ other, + ] the biggest effect of the crack children -- -- {F uh, } in the school system.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } they say, uh-huh, because they really don't want to pay for a service that's not being done properly either.	24
It sounded you were calling  from around the world somewhere <laughter>.	24
{C and, } -	26
especially in Texas <laughter>.	9
Yeah,	36
what should I say	25
{C and } one just occurred to me because I was editing a book about it recently,	24
{D Well, } [ that, + that's ] an excellent, -	21
I know,	15
{F Oh, } he didn't see it?	7
I do not know.	19
{D So, } {F uh, } what do you plan to do with it?	39
I enjoy that.	24
{D Well } there's no quick solution, or  no sure fire easy answer.	9
{C And, } {F uh, } -	26
{F Oh, } go-, -	26
# They're kind of, # -	26
{C but, } {F uh, } [ a big mirror type thing sticking out, + {D like } a metal thing sticking out, ]  hit him in the head --	24
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh,	15
it, {F uh, } really is helpful if a parent and the student can get there and see -- -- the real character of the school and the real life experiences of the school.	9
Attleboro, itself, -	24
# Yeah. #	15
I am not switching completely because, I will put myself a year behind.	24
{F Uh, } yes I am to, {F uh, } both questions.	4
I would not either.	24
Uh-huh,	15
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh } no <laughter>.	21
{F Uh, } {C but } I was talking to my roommate a couple of nights ago, right after that game,	24
{F Hm. }	26
Uh-huh.	15
{D You know }  {D like } C C C was run by the army	24
{C but } that's one of the reasons  why he chose Williams -- -- that it has solid liberal arts,  *[[end of slash unit?]] About two thousand,   *[[should be indep slash unit. See B.8]]	13
That yuppie kind of crowd, yeah.	21
Yeah,	15
# {C and, }  like # I said, we always ate beef and, {F uh, } pork, # {D you know, } # a lot,	24
Definitely.	36
{C and } I know they're suffering	9
{D You know, } there's, -	26
Yeah	36
-- {C and, }  {F uh, } we'll try to rent something that they can see as well as something else that we can see	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D actually } -- -- [ I, + I ] thought that that would be very interesting thing to do.	9
Okay,	38
Uh-huh <<faint>>.	15
{F Uh, } in Kenosha?  <Laughter>.	8
A long time out, all through college and everything  I was in the choirs.	24
{C and } I say,  {D you know, } you were singing at this time, and with these people,	24
{C And, } {F uh, } I, {F um, } went with the Department of State Treasurer in retirement disability,	24
this is actually my third year.	24
Okay,	29
{C and, } {F uh, } {F uh, } [ some rooms, + ] we have one room that we never use.	24
the personal sheriff [ doesn't like + doesn't  ] get to have  a gun	24
{F Ooh, } I wish I could do that <laughter>.	24
# [ They weren't + # -- -- they weren't ] any criminal.	24
{C and } I guess we have to, talk about credit cards.	8
{C and } it's not healthy,	9
[ that, +  that ] a little more than scared me,	24
{F Um, } {C but } [ I, + {F um, } I ]  think eventually I'll start using it for spreadsheets and  things like that.	24
I don't.	24
we're still waiting to go again.	24
{C and } [ them, + {F um, } both ] places had pretty good state income tax.	24
{C and } it is easier to chew.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	36
{C But, } {F uh, } anyway, -	26
{C And, } [ I see that as being, + [ I, + I ] see that as being ]  [ [ a, + a, ] + a ] change, {F uh, } for the positive.  Kind of along the same line [ [ as, + as, ] + as ] the mandatory thing.	24
Yeah.	15
Now, it's the other way around.	9
{C and } it takes some drastic steps at this point.	9
Sure --	15
Yeah,	15
# Bye-bye. #	38
Now they go to a state college	24
# it's like # nothing to them.	2
-- that are sometimes so dumb <laughter>.	2
That's sounds fun too.	21
{D Well, } that sounds good.	21
Yeah,	36
{D Well, } {D like } my younger brothers and sisters at home. -	3
{E I mean } -- -- # {D you know, } those aren't, # -	9
Between the channels there was, {F uh, } the casualties,  the amount of missiles launched were different	24
he was out of the country at one time for three months.	24
Yeah.	15
as far as they're concerned, they've come to the promised land,	9
the only Birmingham I could think of was Alabama.	24
Really?	12
I understand when [ they pulled the troops out of, + {F uh, } {E or } they reduced the number of troops in  ] Europe after the Berlin Wall went down,	24
Dukakis.	30
Okay.	38
# [ {C Bu-, } + {C but } ] we haven't #  really done anything for a long time because [ we've, + we've ] had two kids in college that -- -- just have graduated in the past year.	24
# if # nothing else just those experiences beyond [ and, +  and ] including your educational classes that help give you the  self-esteem to do and achieve, # whatever # you set your mind on,	9
{F Oh, } I don't know, I've lived here since seventy-four,  Howard,	24
{C and } I kind of got, -	26
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	15
{D Well, } I've enjoyed talking to you. #	38
I seem to remember those shows being on in the afternoon.	8
{F Uh, } {C and } if it's,   <throat_clearing> {D you know, } {F uh, } just people  helping people I think [ makes, + <laughter> makes ] the community so much happier.	9
Yeah.	15
No,	26
Right.	15
Absolutely.	36
Right,	11
{C and, }  {F uh, } I haven't gotten called yet,	24
That way it might get better.	9
I don't know if I can quite call myself a distinct generation from you,	24
I'm putting on less than fifteen thousand miles a year.	24
Sounds like a place where I grew up <laughter>.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } you get, -	26
{C Because } a lot of these guys, {D you know, } they get in	24
{C And } she told me what she had  requested.	24
{C and } the trial won't take place until June.	24
yeah.	15
[ {C And, } +  {C and } ]  even, of course there's a lot of years between the two of us,	24
Yeah,	15
You put in, {F um } -- -	24
The idea that, {F um, } -	26
it's like a swamp.	24
Oh.	15
{C and } -- -- we don't have the Siesta,	24
<laughter> {F Uh, } one picks up real quick	24
{C and } yeah,	24
It's [ just, +   just ] the special effects, {D you know. }	24
Right.	15
-- <Laughter> {C and so, } {F uh, }  we really want <noise> four or five bedroom house	24
{F Huh. } {C And } I think the Federal government [ is, + {F uh, } is ] really far away from, {F uh, } {F uh, } control.	9
Now taking care of them, running them everywhere, helping with homework, the bath, the whole, you know, everything.	24
Yeah.	4
Right.	15
{C and so, } -	26
{C and, }  {F uh, } I don't know that juries have a right to know more because in a sense we call those safeguards,	24
{C But } usually [ it's, + [ it, + it ]  hasn't ] caught on yet.	24
[ {C and } all + {C and } be all, ] -	26
# Right, #	15
{C And then } this guy from [ Federal, +  Federal ] Express comes along.	24
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah,	15
I think alls you have to do is push a couple buttons.	9
{F Oh, } definitely.	36
That was,	36
there really isn't any kind of particular food that [ I, +  I ] [ don't, +   don't ] like really,	24
and if they don't have any living relatives, -	9
Uh-huh.	15
then the University of Pennsylvania is {D like } two hours from here by train	24
yeah,	36
they must have a special source for getting them because even at the Farmer's Market, {F uh, } # you can't # find them -- -- like that	24
{C and } she took [ our Golden Retriever, {F oh, } not the Golden Retriever, + the Norwegian Elk Hound ] over there --	24
Right.	15
I don't see a thing wrong with that.	24
Yes,	38
our vacations have always been,  {F um, } {F uh, } {F uh, }   [ as, + as ] they've gotten older.	24
# {C and, }  {F uh } # -- -- <Sniffing> I can imagine that, {F uh, } {F uh, } for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case.	24
and then I lived in (( )), most of my life.	24
it certainly is.	36
<Talking>.	20
Right,	36
{D Well. } This is only a little small city.	24
{C and } he did fine, at home,	24
How funny <laughter>.	21
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh. }	15
{C but } by golly we're going to make a statement here -- -- {D you know. }	24
They were doing some, {F uh, } ozone testing,   [ and, + ] {F uh, } [ th-, +  the ] E P A	24
Yeah,	36
of course, our government is full of liars, thieves, and crooks.	9
{F Oh, } okay.	29
{C and } it's because I <noise> exercise --	24
What's it called?	39
I don't know how it works exactly #	19
{D Well } he called our supervisor    [ and our supervisor, + and our supervisor's supervisor, ]	24
{C so } -- -- [ you haven't, +  you haven't ]  pulled any weeds lately?	8
{F Um. }	26
Uh-huh.	15
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
# {F Oh, } nice. #	21
he does the yard,	24
It's scary <laughter>.	9
{C but } {E I mean, } # in, -	26
Uh-huh.	4
{C Or } you sneak out in the morning after daylight savings time starts and with your cup of coffee and see if it has grown overnight.	9
Let's see.	17
I guess I think [ that, + that, ] {F uh, } <breathing> research is, I guess the most important,   just because [ I, + ]  {D you know, } [ it, + it ]  really needs to come to an end. {D You know. }	9
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
yeah.	15
[ I, + I ] think too many people feel they need to live a more extravagant life-style than necessary --	9
# Uh-huh. #	15
[ it's, +  it's, ]  {F uh, } not dry at all.	24
I've never <noise> wanted to bad enough to make any effort to do it, {D you know. }	24
Uh-huh.	15
I think that would probably, <breathing> {F uh, } be very possible,	24
{C And } my closet -	26
{C and } those statistics <throat_clearing> in turn got them bigger budgets.	9
Uh-huh.	15
# {F Oh, } I see. #	15
I don't know what it's like now,	24
my daughter says NINE OH TWO ONE OH.	24
Yeah.	4
{D You know, } let's go back to our original thing with, {D you know, } our experiments and all [ the, + {D you know, } our ] actual exploring of space [ and, + and ] all that,	18
Right.	15
{F Um. }	26
You really do have to study to get  yourself, {F uh, } up to par with what is truly going on --	9
Right.	15
{E I mean, } I don't know,	19
[ {C But } everything was, + {C and } everything, ] -	24
or, -	26
I know.	36
{F Uh, } {C and } you're right.	36
{F Oh, } you got ten,	24
{D Well, } it has.	36
# Uh-huh. #	15
{D so. } -	26
Yeah,	36
I find myself, {F uh, } listening to a lot of, {F uh, } {F uh, } either old timer or New England, {F uh, } dance bands as well as, {F uh, } just more popular folk music and new artists coming up.	24
Uh-huh.	15
It's what you do. You know.	9
-- he was the pioneer of aerobics and all of health {D really. }	24
{C and } it causes the glass to crack	24
Uh-huh,	4
Yeah,	36
{C and then } he went to a baby sitter that this lady had about five other kids that she baby sat, {D you know } --	24
{C but, } {F um, } it was an older home,	24
{C But } at least that way it is at nobody's house, so [ nobody one, + no one  ] person is responsible for everything.	24
-- and, {F uh, } lots of kids and stuff, -	24
It's a little twenty-two	24
we saw part of THE AFRICAN QUEEN [ on, + on ] T V a couple of years ago,	24
my husband, {F uh, } is working [ mo-, + {D you know, } most ] of the time.	24
you just don't see it anywhere else, as far as the different styles in the houses and whatnot.	24
{F Uh, } they don't have as good as insurance packages as big corporations.	9
{C so } {D well, } I still got a few more years,	24
{C So, } she's been there since August the thirteenth and seems to have adjusted pretty well.	24
{C So } you have participated with that in the past?	7
I know our church youth group, {F uh, } starts with projects young	24
{C and then } there are some a lot younger, [ an, + ] about four generations, I guess.	24
They usually have, {F uh, } {F uh, } {D you know, } a video, {F uh, } highlights of the season, {D you know, } and basically kind of walks you through what happened to the Mavs and who they traded for and how they did and a lot of good footage, both the good and the bad --	24
That would probably be good,	21
{C because } they made a big deal about how [ this, +  this ] film was such a big leap for [ the, + the  ] people [ who, +  who ] were the ancestors of [ the, + this  ] Indian tribe	9
I've got some that [ I, + {D you know, } I ] haven't even used at all, {F uh, } past few years	24
{C And. } -	26
That's right.	36
{F Um, } <sigh> I guess I can relate to that, because I have two kids that are opposites like that.	24
I like to fish.	24
Right.	15
Yeah,	15
Yeah.	15
It's frustrating when I don't know what's going on.	24
No,	36
That's a lot.	9
I've just read a lot about it,	24
# Yeah, # --	15
{C and } she's already reading and writing and stuff, # like that.	24
that would be, -	26
Yeah,	15
I just took grades one through six.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
[ I'm learning t-, + I'm learning to ] be, {F uh, } one who knows what's he's doing --	27
{C and } we walk a couple of miles  and  then come back to the house.	24
{C And, }  {F uh, } I know my husband <thumping>  now we go vote every time.	24
Uh-huh <<faint>>.	15
Uh-huh.	15
You almost have, to get started pretty early probably. I guess,	8
I, -	26
# This is, {F uh, } # -	26
[ {C and, } +  {C because } ] I have a ten year old	24
Yeah,	38
[ That's, + that's ] got to be a frightening way to -- -- spend an evening.	9
{C and } [ I, + I ] would have thought of that earlier	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	4
you just don't see cars like that.	9
[ and, + and ] DRIVING MISS DAISY.	24
{C so, } -	26
have you ever owned your own home,	7
{C and } people notice it as far as, {F uh, } highways being, {F uh, } {D you know, } -	9
Uh-huh.	15
New clothes and stuff.	2
Do you by any chance?	7
to the mall,  to the movies, to the friends, to the, -	2
{C but, }  {F uh, } at least, we, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I thought, gee whiz, {D you know, } I don't know if he's really doing that or not or if [ he's, th-, + he's the ] person who lives there.  {F Uh, }	24
last week we got a lot.	24
{C but } I've [ never been, + {F uh, } never had ] to do it.	24
{C so. } -	26
{C And } I work for my instructor	24
-- [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C so } ] it's different than a company where most companies fund almost the entire thing,	24
{D You know } {C and, } -	26
# {C And } that's, -	26
{C But, } {F uh, } if she couldn't, someone visited him every day.	24
{C so } you're probably in a, {D you know, } -	24
I've just rolled seventy thousand miles,	24
{D Well, } {F uh, } that's great.	21
{C so, } {F uh, } long term probably is a little bit better than short term simply because, {F uh, } it's automatically taken out.	9
{E I mean, } {C but } again it's a set amount every month. {C And, } {F uh, } on special occasions,  {E I mean } birthdays and things like that.	24
Have y'all been having any heat waves or {D like } the ninety degree, -	7
{C And so, } obviously it didn't work in California.	24
Oh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Okay.	15
you don't get [ that, + that  ] source of cleansing anymore.	9
# {F Oh, } # {D well, } see, I'm getting so many calls to Texas.	24
I have a Subaru, {F uh, } G O X T.	24
Yeah.	15
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah.	15
does she need help with anything,	25
Part of it is that, part of it is technology.	9
{E I mean } [ the, +  the ] counties are much larger.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Right.	15
{D Well, } it's probably on its way  up there.	9
Uh-huh.	15
[ you're not, +   you're not ] missing anything, {D you know, }	25
Uh-huh.	4
That's true,	36
Because it affects child care	9
{C but } [ [ it, + it, ] + B M W -s ] good for that.	9
I guess [ for, + for ] kids {D like, }  as they get older, -	9
Yeah,	15
{F Oh, } the same type of church.	30
{C but } [ they, + they  ] certainly have lower crime rates and lower murder rates.	9
I've heard [ [ it, + it, ] + it's ] not one for the videos.	24
It's a good general [ [ e-, +  ed-, ] +   education ] for [ a, +  a ] bachelor's degree.	9
Uh-huh.	15
they tend to try to be, {D you know, } real lax	24
{C and } they go camping,	24
{C and } we had Italian, {F um, }	24
[ it's, + it's ] just really not there anymore.	9
[ {C And } + {C so, }  ] I have really enjoyed that	24
"I said {D ""well, } what did you have"""	24
{C and } they send me [ and, + and ] have me, {F uh, } {D you know, } go through [ this, + this, ] thing, {D you know,  }	24
{C and } something, -	24
# Because # every time I got through, I went to Dallas, Texas.	24
{F Oh, }  yeah.	15
{C and } it has been for a long time	24
[ {C and } I was thinking -- + -- {D yeah, } {C and } I was thinking ] -	24
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } I think it's hard to leave them,	9
How neat.	21
{D So, } yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
I read a book recently called IRON JOHN.	24
{C but. } -	26
-- [ {C and so, } + {C and } ] that's back in the -- -	24
I think we're lucky to  have as good a coverage as we have --	9
# {C and } he's like # {D well, } {D you know, } what's the big deal about being home, # for your kids. #	24
even though we've, {F uh, } enjoyed very good employment here for the past ten years, -	24
Yeah,	15
Huh-uh.	33
{C and } are you talking about public schools being lower level, high school level or -- -- # state school. #	7
Yeah.	15
This country seems to be a little behind on that.	9
{F Oh, } okay.	38
the fact that, {F uh, } during their early changes where, {D you know, } women did [ come more, + [ speak, + maybe speak ] out, {A I was going to say, } come more ] out of themselves, -	9
it is just, {F uh, } very humid,	24
Emil [ is, + probably pulls ] down a third [ a-, + of ] all my time.	24
I was trying to think of some [ while, + while ] it was, {F uh, } talking about it,	24
-- {C but,} I don't even want to worry about what the original intent was,	24
[ What, + {F uh } -- -- what ] do you feel are important to  you or other people [ as, + as ] crucial benefits?	39
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
If you, -	26
{C and, } -	26
Yeah,	15
{C and } the hammer came back and hit me in the thumb and blood squirted everywhere.	24
{C And } they told me,  they look through them all and throw out the ones that don't belong  there and then, {D you know, } go and recycle the rest.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	36
Yeah.	38
They, {F uh, } -	26
# Uh-huh. #	15
<Laughter>  {C But } [ [ [ I, + I ] also, + I also, ] +  I ] don't know if you've, {F uh, } read any of [ [ the, +  [ {F + ] um, } {F oh, } what do they call those. The, ] +  {F uh, } the ] early  [ republican, + {F uh, } republic ] documents, {F uh, } when they were arguing through constitutional law written by Hamilton and all those people.	8
That would be great <breathing>	9
{C but } go ahead.	18
# Sure. #	36
{F Oh, } yeah,	36
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	36
Right.	15
{C So } the next size up was a Two Hundred and Eleven	24
{D Well, } I really enjoy reading the newspaper,	24
Uh-huh.	15
# {F Um. } #	26
Uh-huh.	15
He stays in.	24
I didn't.	11
a little bit of love [ and, + and ]  attention is what most of them need.	9
# Uh-huh. #	15
except it broke my heart.	24
Not getting to go.	8
Yeah.	15
like a fine arts education,	2
{C but } I certainly can't create.	24
{C and, } {F uh. } -	26
{C and then } it seems sort of like a San Antonio early Winter or Fall, # year-round.  #	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
I'm happy with the school,	24
That's true.	36
My parents are in the same situation, {D you know. }	24
I only weigh sixteen today.	25
{C so } you've, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{D So, } -	26
{C and } {D like } let's say    [ [ [ you, +   you're, ] +  you're, ] +   {D you know, } you're ]   driving out	9
That's okay	21
so do I.	24
{D Well, } [ we got a, + I think we got a ] pretty good newspaper.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } they do.	21
Yeah,	30
Yeah.	15
yeah,	15
# So to speak.  #	11
That's all I got to say for it.	24
{C And } [ we, + ] [ the, + the ]  principal feature I like about ours is that it's pier and beam.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } -- -- now [ you, + {D you know, } you ] can tell the change, for sure.	24
[ you can, + I know in the push up, at least, you can ] get chest muscles  and the back of your arms quite built up -- -- just doing push ups.	24
Yeah,	15
{E I mean, } [ I don't, + I don't ] think my  parents would	24
{E I mean } [ it's was, + it's ] just, -	26
I don't know if you saw the tour posters of the Rolling Stones when they last toured,	8
-- {C and } it shows the town,	24
-- they gave a run down that [ Texas + -- -- Texas ] tends to be a little more robust and disciplined # area  (( then )) . # -	24
# Is that right? #	12
uh-huh.	15
it's a good time for gardening.	9
[ Law, +  law ] was a lot of fun until you get to law school --	24
{D like } a Friday afternoon when I'm tired, it's the end of the week  and I just want to go home.   [ And + ] I'll make myself go,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{E I mean, } did you have to draw a line,	7
{D Well, } I find that lately that so  many people are [ working, +  {D you know, } working ] waitressing jobs {C or } waiter,	24
{C and } [ [ they, + they at least have, ] + now they have at least ] some marginally marketable skills and more discipline.	9
I'm about fifteen miles out.	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	26
I had a gang of people over and kind of made a fried chicken thing and biscuits, and kind of [ southern, + {F uh, } southern  ] food even though I'm up here in New York,	24
living down here. -	26
{F Oh, } we're really excited about it.	24
{C and then } I have to bring it back.	24
{C and } you wonder, {D well, } who's going to get ahold of this  and think, {F um, } that's a nice place to go rob <laughter>.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Is, {F uh, } kind of fun. -	13
{C And, } -	26
-- [ {C and, } +  {C and, } ] {F um, } put, [ here, + here  ] -	26
[ who's, + who's ] supposed to have [ [ the, + the, ] + {F uh, } the ] best, {F uh, } draft picks?	39
[ [ I, + I,  ] + I  ] come from a musical background,	24
that's, very important.	9
{C But, }  {F um, } they have about four or five different prices now,	24
it's not my favorite,	24
{C so } I did that.	24
{C and } I was so interested in the auto show I didn't think to ask anybody, -	24
Really great,	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C Or } maybe this evening anyway.	9
Yeah,	15
I used it as a pacifier.	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } th-, -	26
Yeah,	36
Pardon me?	14
Yeah.	15
{C And } there's a big push on for recycling, {F uh, } paper materials, {D you know, } computer output paper and also to decrease the amount of, {F uh, } Styrofoam usage because of [ the, + {F uh, } <whistling> the ] process involved in Styrofoam [ and, + and ] the whole eco issue and that.	24
{C and } you had to vote for, {D you know, } yes or no on each of them	24
Yeah,	15
{C and } I'm just like, {D well, } {F uh, } <laughter> I'm not even going to think much about it -- -- if you're going to treat me with this much respect even before -- -- you've gotten to know me.	24
{C and } I think that their, {F uh, } mentality as far as the way they treat them and that kind of thing, -	9
it's not very expensive, {F uh, }	24
{C But, } {F uh, } there are certain norms that companies should be able to, {F uh, } put out as guidelines for their employees.	9
neither one of us are really, -	24
{C but } I've found out that  actually [ we, + we ] really enjoy getting away from the television, the telephone --	24
Uh-huh.	15
Are they kind of expensive.	7
You mean you use credit cards?	7
{C so, } it can be done.	24
<Laughter>.	20
On your baseboards?	7
Yeah,	15
{C and then, } {D you know, } arrangements are made {D like } during the Summer for {D you know, } {F um, } food and [ whose, + whose ] staying where, because a lot of people  [ fro-, + are from ] down here, in Texas.	24
Uh-huh.	15
yeah.	15
Course, I don't know.	19
Sherman, Texas, {F oh, }	30
He says, I've pressed every switch in that car,	24
{C So, } I've tried to spend  more time with, {F uh, } the children since then.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and then } the government doesn't jump on them hard enough to make them do anything.	9
that's right.	36
[ he, + he's ] kind of a Dustin Hoffman fan anyway.	24
{F Uh, } [ do you have any, + do you do any ] handicraft type things, I think was the question.	24
{C but } [ the, + the ] actual, -	26
I was able to help the coach [ in, +   in ] just controlling the kids, if nothing else,	24
Being down there, do you, {F uh, } get to see, {D like } the colonial or any of those?	7
{C so, } {F um, } the last couple of years I really have tried not to use them at all.	24
relaxed -- -- and laid back and stuff	9
You can just go buy one and  take it home	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
I think they deliberately sometimes, {F um, } -	9
Yeah.	15
{C So } why have any restrictions at all?	16
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	4
Me and cats don't get along too well, {F uh } <laughter>,	24
Uh-huh.	15
One thing I don't understand is [ the, + the ] whole concept of death row.	24
No,	33
{C So } you, -	26
You can't  ((   )) , -	9
{C But then, } they started going downhill like everybody else.	9
{C or } I'm going to get over it and just go ahead and eat as healthily as I possibly can, {D you know. }	9
{D Well, } it's real dry down there.	24
{C But } we're set now.	24
it's,  {F uh, } -	26
-- {C and } I, -	26
-- {C and } I said, I'll never find another one for that price.	9
{C and } it was like you said, {D you know, } it was [ blue + -- -- blue ] cast to it.	24
{C but } it had   existed for three years.	24
{C But } [ only, + only ] one is really {D like } <noise> in the flower bed part	24
{C But } still, when the kids get older, they learn how to break through that parental control.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } that's good.	21
Bye.	38
# God, I # can't believe we moved out of an apartment and had this much stuff	24
I [ was, + ]  left the fourth grade weighing about a hundred pounds and started the seventh grade, grade at two,	24
{F Um, } what do you think about the proposal that all young Americans should spend a year or two, -	31
# Yeah. #	15
{C but } that's not really providing you news.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } that's good.	21
Uh-huh.	15
Did you feel like you did a good job?	0
[ [ I, + I, ] + I ] find it very strange.	24
((   ))  California is the biggest for elementary schools	24
Yeah.	15
Kind of interesting.	9
people [ have, +  have ] really quieted down after  everything started	9
Yeah.	15
And then THELMA AND LOUISE,	24
{C or, } {D you know, } I always have, [ or + ] letter writing,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Used to be people would say, do you work, and you'd say, no, I work in the home	9
{C and } [ just, + he was just ] ahead  at an early age	24
I'm not that old,	24
Are they young,	7
Yeah,	15
[ I know, + I know ] what you mean.	24
{C But, }  yeah,	15
-- # yeah,	36
Okay,	15
I know sometimes when you think there are things running while they're at the same unit, like the headlamp --	24
{C so } [ I'm, + {F uh, } I'm ] hanging onto those and doing as much activity as I can with them.	24
{C but } then that gas  mileage was just atrocious,	9
Richardson area.	24
{D So, } {D you know, } [ it's, + it's ] very hard to say, {D you know, } this is what we should cut.	9
they built a home just a couple miles from us.	24
{C so, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
but this year it wasn't bad at all.	9
The only painting job that was really <children_talking> <smack> painless for us was in this condominium that the, {F um, } association that manages it, <children_talking> they have to take care of like the structural <breathing> damage.	24
{C but } -- -- I've been real interested in some of those cute [ country, + country ] kind of things.	24
Yeah,	36
I don't think I would have insurance, {F uh, }  [ other, + ]	24
they do not do uniforms, although one,  where he was between {D like } second and eighth grade -- -- did.	24
{F Um, } that's kind of an odd color for a bathroom.	21
Right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
No.	33
Right,	15
(( {F Oh, } really )) ,	15
she's pretty wild.	24
{F Oh, } wow.	21
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
It comes back.	2
{D Well, } {D now } who do you play with?	39
{D well }  there's not much I can do about it.	24
# {F Oh, } {F oh, } # I see.	15
{F Huh. }	15
{C But, } {F uh, } no,	15
That's true.	36
# {C but } # -- -- I thought, gosh, summer time, {D you know. }	9
{C But then } the weather's {D like, } -	24
[ [ They're, + {F uh, } you ge-, ] + they're ] just made of, I guess it's different kinds of rubber,	9
it's really, -	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C So, } [ I really, + I really ] like that,	24
Uh-huh, uh-huh.	15
They would just turn it on	24
I couldn't care about any of it.	24
they just do not allow them.	9
Uh-huh <baby>.	15
Always want to go to [ Canada + -- -- Canada ] to Banff or somewhere like that <laughter>.	24
I don't know,	19
<Laughter>.	20
# There # was dishes that he really enjoyed, eating.	24
Right.	11
We try to spend Saturdays together.	24
{C and then } [ I, + I ] took a tole -- -- painting class -- -- to learn how to paint them right, # {D you know. } #	24
Than the intensive eye?	7
{D You (( know )) }  you carry around a wallet full of credit cards,	24
Yeah.	15
{F Huh. }	15
Yeah.	15
I hated that.	24
{C So, } Garland, how nice is it now,	24
Okay.	29
{D You know, } [ {C and, } + {C and so } ]  they may be even [ be-, +  better ] this year.	9
Right,	15
The, {F uh, } -	26
# You go,  {D you know } # three or four hours before the game.	24
<Sniffing>.	20
{C And } [ they're not, + {D you know, } they're not ]  doing anything to support themselves, while they're there.	24
{D you know, } NATO [ is, + is ] on the way of being disbanded.  {F Uh, }	24
{C but } it's  [ not a, + not a ] regular thing.  <laughter>	24
<Baby_crying>.	20
did you go to Baylor?	7
today.   *[[slash error]] Yeah.	26
Uh-huh,	4
<Laughter>  I have a three and a half year old and a one and  a half year old.	24
Uh-huh,	15
That area.	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ There, + there ]  has not been a lot of peace in that part of the world.	9
Uh-huh.	15
-- {F um, } {C but } they're very easy to train --	24
my husband still got up and went to work --	24
{C and } the city had a very low tax base so they didn't have a lot -- -- of money to work with.	24
{F Uh, } it didn't hurt them any.	22
it's been about a year.	24
{C or, } -	26
Yeah.	15
A what?	14
Bye-bye.	38
{C but } I had that from all my kids except for one.	24
{C and } I haven't helped them out [ on the me-, + on men ] particularly,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I said, Uh-huh.	24
he just can't do it quite as fast,	9
-- {C and, } {F uh, } those are really neat.	24
{F Oh, } that's good.	21
{C but } I won't do it if I have to do it.	24
basically there's [ the, + {D you know, } the ] expenses that are fixed during the month -- -- {D you know } the ones that come  [ every, + every ] month	24
A what?	14
{F Huh. }	26
{C but } for the, -	26
one of them's eleven	24
[ I, + I ] had a lot of things that  [ I, + I, ] -	24
my husband works for the state,	24
[  I was, + I would ] just be, -	26
I think other than health insurance, I think, {F uh, } {D you know, } an extra week of, {F uh, } <lipsmack> time off would be nice.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Right.	15
Yeah.	36
good luck.	38
{C and, } <breathing> that's fun, trying to explain that  to a four year old <laughter>.	24
Right.	15
<Laughter>.	20
{D Well } that's about all the movies I've seen recently <laughter>.	24
Always <laughter>.	24
{F Uh, } [ we, + we ] did all we could,	24
{C or, } {D you know, } because [ it, + ]  they can't remove themselves,	9
Yeah.	15
{C And } I [ camp, {F uh, } every month, {F uh, } + camp at least one weekend ]	24
{C but } then my brother-in-law works there,	24
It's a Mazda.	24
# yeah.	15
Yeah,	4
we just like it real well -	24
There was one guy I use to watch on E S P N,	24
Uh-huh.	15
they tried to put me in some kind of immobilized walker,  because he doesn't like to put casts on when it's warm.	24
Right,	15
<Laughter> {F Oh, } I've had them like that before, too.	24
No,	33
it just really gets me depressed, even to watch it.	24
Yes,	36
Yeah.	36
you think it's a Chevrolet in the good old U S A	9
Yeah,	15
I stay home with two kids.	24
[ You, + you  ] have Fords and [ [ I, + I,  ] + {F uh, } I  ] have three Chevys, [ which + ] --	24
Right.	36
we believe this,	25
Commercial, [ sol-, + solicitations ] primarily.	24
[ this is, + this is, ] part of giving back a portion of what He's given to us.	9
# [ {C and }  it, + {D yeah, } {C and } it ] kind of, {F uh, } -	26
{C but } it's not going to, -	9
Do you?	12
[ [ It, + {F uh } -- -- it  ] was just, + it was  ] marvelous.	24
whenever  we have [ at + ] the big get-together over at her house  she makes this meat ball sauce	24
{C and } Saint Louis was much the same.	24
Uh-huh.	15
<Clicking>.	20
We just can't seem to, {D you know, } -	9
# Uh-huh. #	15
{C But } she also had made, {F uh, } flan, which is actually Spanish, I think.	24
When I just had a problem with my neck and they ended up  doing a seven hundred dollar CAT scan, [ and, + ] {E I mean, } a chiropractor  got it in one time <laughter>,	24
I agree.	36
I do.	24
-- {C but } it does sound like it's definitely growing.	22
What?	14
he, {F uh, } works, {F uh, }  for a different company.	24
It was like, -	9
My daughter was going, to Camp Goddard, {F um, } which is through the Plano school system, # {D you know } in the fall # -- -- couple of years ago	24
-- {C so, } think I want to find something that has a lower -- -- rate.	24
The nice thing about autocrossing is [ you can, + you can ] do both.	24
uh-huh.	15
have you had problems getting colors to match?	7
Used to be when you had a personality conflict [ you just, +  you ]  worked with it	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
what, # -	26
{D Well, } I found that, {F uh, } {D you know, } things, as I have gotten older, -	24
{F Uh, } I think sometimes other things suffer and tha-, -	24
{C but } in Florida now, {F uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, }  [ at eighteen years, +  someone was just sentenced to eighteen years, ]   {A I heard it on TODAY, } {F uh, } without any specific recommendation for, {F uh, } {F uh, }  {F uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, } waving the normal,  {F uh, } procedures.	24
Yes	36
Mine is a senior in high school,	24
Yeah,	15
{C and } I could really talk about  like gardening or something,	24
{C but } I don't think he's, -	26
that's true  ((   )) .	36
{C So, } -	26
{C but } it's merely an economic now.	24
[ five tenths indic-, + {F uh, } usually two one tenth indicators -- ] -- at a hundred dollars each.  {F Uh, }	9
Okay.	24
{F Um. } I would, too, if I had kids.	26
It's pretty dangerous out there, {D you know, } when they fall over,	24
{C and } they gave it to me for that price.	24
{C and } I told him, -	26
{C and } they tend to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict.	9
Oh.	15
{D Well, } guess what,	18
{C And, } {F uh, } <throat_clearing> most of the cooking I do just comes out of a can.	24
I haven't here lately.	34
Yeah.	15
{D Now, } I think that would be fair.	36
-- after, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C so, } {D you know, } [ it's, +  it's ]  not a great indication because there have been teams that have just, {D you know, } come out  and just won all kinds of games in Spring [ crani-, +  training ] and  then gone on a, {D you know, } fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season	24
They, -	26
I, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
# No. #	33
Uh-huh.	15
{C so. } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } I know,	21
{C and } there was so many baby food jars, kind of what started it.	24
Course they have such a crime problem because they have such a [ un-, + unemployment ] rate.	9
{F Oh, } I see.	29
<Noise> <<sounds likes a burp>>.	20
[ they aren't, + they aren't ] by nature really nasty critters.	24
{F Oh, } goodness,	17
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
[ they, +  with the drugs [ they're, + they're  ] ] robbing and killing	24
Really.	15
<<Very faint>>  Uh-huh.	15
I do t-, -	36
I don't do it quite as much as I used to.   {F Um, } I guess because [ I, + I ] went back to school,	24
That's right,	11
{C so } I lived in New England at the  time,	24
Yeah.	15
{C And } yet, [ the as-, + the attorney, ] for the prosecution could not enter [ these, + {F uh, }  the ] good man's background into it.	24
{C but } it was rainy and icky.	24
{C and, } {D you know, } it has got to be gone or daddy gets into [ the, + {D you know, } the ] leftovers.	24
you can tell some of the newscasters when they like the heat, because they'll talk about it being so gorgeous on those days when we're melting,	9
I don't think the Cowboys have got a chance.	24
course, for a dinner party, you fancy things up a little bit more.	9
{F Oh, } good.	21
{C But } [ I have seen -- + -- # lately, # {D yes, } [ I am seeing, + I'm seeing a ] ] change that, {D whoops, }  government can't do it,	24
Would be, shoosh.	9
{C and } that's it.	24
I have a motor home <laughter>.	24
[ What, + what ]  program are you in over at Carnegie Mellon?	39
Yeah,	36
Okay.	15
{C So, } we virtually did that for about two years, # which # worked real well, and then moved from California where we realized we could never buy a house anyway <laughter> no matter how much we saved, # and # moved to Texas, bought a house immediately, {D you know, } which, of course, is now devalued with the housing market,	24
{C and, }  {F uh, } I've taught C P R training	24
{C so, } -	26
Uh-huh,	15
[ I, + I ] think, our kids  just always dearly loved that, {D you know, } play bounce the ball, or -- -- just, {F uh, } -	24
{C And } I always wonder whether there are people who know a lot about every area disagreeing with them on everything, [ or, + or ] what's going on <laughter>.	24
[ it's, +  it's ] got people singing,	24
I will read them in a doctor's office, too.	24
{F Oh, } you're right here,	8
{C and } you have, {D you know, } people stealing other people's stuff,	9
{C So } I'm very, very lucky <laughter>.	24
{C So, } I was in a lot of classes where,  {F uh, } [ there, + I ] was either the only girl or, {D you know, } one of just a very, few women in the class.	24
Is that where [ you, + you ] are originally from around there?	7
Was the guinea pig [ for your, + for your ] child?	7
{C so } we've [ got, + {D you know, } got ] some investment in it,	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
# Yeah	15
# hey, #	13
{C and } you marinate it.	24
Do you use NuSkin skin care.	7
yeah ...	26
[ It was, + it was ] all done in studio with smoke and mirrors and all the Hollywood magic.	24
Really?	12
Yeah.	15
Right.	36
# That was really called # roughing it,	2
Uh-huh.	15
{C But, }  {F um, } our Chows, we've had them, I'd say, right around six maybe seven years	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } okay.	15
{D Well } the last two people who have called, both worked for T I	24
{C and } we had a  vocational, {F uh, } electronics in our high school.	24
{C And, } {F um, } Captain Pell's is a place with the  big huge wooden tables inside,	24
Bye, bye.	38
{C and, } {F uh, } this next car will probably be my retirement car.	24
{D Well } the first one I joined, they went out of business	24
Those are a thousand bucks.	9
Uh-huh	15
You mean somebody that has an actual establishment.	22
{C But, } {F uh, } down here I haven't fished much in Texas.	24
Okay.	38
I do too.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } the problem with Reaganomics is that the people at the top are the ones getting rich.	9
that's good, too,	21
Uh-huh.	15
# Right.  #	15
-- it's not a liter,	36
Right.	15
[ I don't -- + -- {F uh, } I think ] that we should have good relations [ with, + with ] Mexico,	9
{C and } we basically own all the land around this little lake, there,	24
Yeah.	15
{C But, } {F um, } I would love to  just take some scissors and cut them in half.	24
Yes,	38
Yeah.	15
{C and } I can sort of handle that	24
{C But } when I went more rural,  {D you know, } [ that, +  it ] really changed.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } -	26
I think the Saint Augustine and, {F uh, } Centipede grass   is another one you have quite a bit of down there --	9
# {C And } the hours are wonderful	24
I know what family home evening's all about.	24
{C and } they look like a lily, sort of.	24
{C and } you hear about somebody's crime,	9
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } I also [ use, + like to use ] Discover when I can, because they give you some money back every year.	24
okay.	38
It really does.  {F Uh, }	36
Right.	15
uh-huh.	15
{C but } I, -	26
I can remember it not, -	24
{C And then } there's an attache case, and cordless telephone,	24
# they haven't changed # at all, {D you know. }	24
uh-huh.   {F Uh, }	15
Yeah,	4
{C and, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } they just grow rocks	24
he did.	36
<Breathing>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
Right.	15
{C so. } -	26
{C and, } they want, -	26
i-, -	26
[ It's, +  it's ] your core education, your [ general requi-, + general education requirements. ]	24
{D Well, } as far as I'm concerned [ and + ] it's probably  apt that your call's at this time because we just got through watching, {F uh, } REASONABLE DOUBTS. Which had a, {D you know, } capital case in it.	24
<laughter>.	20
{F oh, } yeah <laughter>.	4
Uh-huh.	15
I think that's really the only thing.  I guess where I would like to see the system change is, {F uh, } {F uh, } there ought to be [ a, + a ] (( {D well } )) -	9
Uh-huh.	15
# That's interesting. #	21
Right.	36
it is.	24
{C because } I'm not that good at it,	24
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
I don't know,	19
I guess I kind of do a similar thing.   More, {F uh, } medium or  longer range.	24
{C but } [ they didn't, + they didn't ] age it -- -- quite enough it seemed.	9
You know,	13
of course, I'm one of those that does two things at once,	24
Real-, -	26
{C and } I adopted the Royals,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Where is home for you?	39
# Uh-huh. #	15
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } they're not making new ones.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C So } I got my chicken  ((   )) and all my little net  and everything,	24
[ I, + ] {C and } most of them I have bought, {F um, } already clothed,	24
{C and } they have a  job that has nothing to do ... -	24
When we travel we look for Wendy's because we have kids,	24
{C but } [ then -- + -- then, ] {D you know, } the defense  lawyer addressed each and every one of those blows apparently #	24
{C But } just enough that his bite is off a little bit	24
they came from all over.	24
once you get it done, then you probably won't have that problem again.	9
[ [ we, + we, ] + we ] like to eat even when we eat out {C and } stuff we eat a lot of Chinese food, # or # Japanese food or, {D you know, } # Korean #  ((   )) ,	24
{F Uh, } my girlfriend has with her sisters	24
{C So } I guess, {D you know, } [ we, re-, + we have ] so many freedoms over here we sometimes forget about <<pause>> # how # -- -- # great out country # really is.	9
That was with Richard Dreyfuss.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } they get pretty particular sometimes # in # -- -- what they want to have.	24
I don't really drink or anything,	24
I don't understand the idea of paying somebody [ to, + to ] do it.	9
Did you know that next week there's several T V shows coming from there in celebration of their anniversary.	7
I do, too --	24
{D Now } I don't want [ a can, + a garage ] full of cans <laughter>.	24
{F Uh, } {C but, } <inhaling> {D you know, } [ other, +  other ]  than that, [ with, +  with ] both my kids being under two, it's real hard -- -- to do [ any, +  any ] kind of -- -- events that, {F uh } -- -- [ don't, +  don't ] require <laughter> as much,	9
{C but, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } yeah,	4
I don't know,	19
Yes.	15
I really leave it on there just [ for, + ] just to have it out of the way # because you put it on the ground it gets dirty. #	24
{C And, } {F uh, } {C so } that would be interesting to see <noise>.	9
{C but } that's a lot of pain and hassle.	9
{D Well, } no,	36
I keep trying, {F uh, } {D you know, }	11
Thank you.	38
I used to smoke a long time ago.	24
{C But } I believe [ [ that, + that, ] + that ] [ [ you, + one of the, ] + one of the ] best things to do, at least for me in school [ was, + was, ] I was sort of forced to take lots of different kinds of courses.	9
right.	36
# Yeah. #	15
Yeah,	36
[ [ That's, +  that's, ] + that's ] not really hard rock.	9
ugh,  I didn't like that either.	9
of course, needs and wants aren't necessarily the same thing.	9
{C or } wonder if they're wanting it.	8
{C So, }  I guess it, {D you know, } -	26
is that, -	26
w-, -	26
{C And } [ it, +  it ] was a [ nice, + {F uh, } nice ] long skiing career,	24
Very few, {F uh, } assaults,	24
{F Oh, } my God.	21
It's an, {F uh, } I B M P C Junior, I think.	24
that's one of my favorites.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I bought a lot of, {F uh, } good cookbooks,	24
# Me, too. #	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } {F uh, } sort of mixed feelings about it, I guess, {F uh, } {F uh, }	24
sure.	15
Yeah.	15
You've got to save up  (( in able to do )) that, right?	9
I don't know.	34
and just basically what they do is they get caught when they wanted to go home for Christmas. Or for any other time.	24
right.	36
They've got the U T Health Science Center out there also.	24
We've never been able to take it off our income tax.	3
Bye-bye.	38
{C and, } {F uh, } I've considered using it once myself,	24
{F uh, } unfortunately the ones that currently pay and pay the premiums for health insurance [ are, + are ] paying for the people that don't have health insurance.	9
That's what happen, that's what wrong, you know.	9
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
# {D So } # you're remodeling?	8
I cannot really say that it's a formal budget,	24
I don't know,	19
{C And } that, -	26
{C and, } there were lights that you could flip  on and so forth.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } they be can be a real <noise> dickens.	9
{C but } you should definitely have the character search and the seven day holding period and things along that nature, {F uh, }	9
Yep.	36
Well, we've always had, uh, Fords.	24
{C and } I'm reading it in the evening,	24
{C so. } -	26
[ [ {C and, } {F uh, } + {C But, } ] + {C and } ] the boys loved it, {D you know, }	24
Uh-huh.	15
I want to see AWAKENING.	24
Yeah.	15
yeah.	26
{F Uh, } there, -	26
{F Oh, } my goodne-,	21
{F Uh. }	15
{C And } my feeling is that, {D you know, } you're only a kid once,  # {C and } you don't want to # -- -- spend your whole life in school.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
{C but, } {F uh, } the idea [ of, + of, ] {F uh, } -	13
-- and, uh, -	26
[ We, + I've ] probably personally take {A I think } just two --	24
C V A E.	24
Yeah.	15
{C or } do they have a standing ball or a machine, or what?	7
[ {C And } + {C but } ] [ I, +  I ] am encouraged by what is happening in the Soviet Union.	24
{F Oh, } really?	12
{F Uh, } I like the Rio Grande Valley. Real well.	24
{C so } unless you have actual, {D you know, } across the board [ s-, + {F uh, } limitations, ] [ the, + {F uh, } {D you know, } the ] idea of, -	9
Yeah,	36
{C but } [ th-, + that's ] like, -	24
{C But } I just have a phobia about not being able to actually sew.	24
# Yeah. #	15
<Child_talking>.	20
[ {C and }  it, + {C but } it's  ] an iron that he's really practiced with.	24
uh-huh.	15
You're kidding!	21
Uh-huh.	15
yeah,	15
{C But } I guess to make it more difficult for the person who's just so irate and upset and, {D you know, } temporarily a little bit, {F uh, } offset or off keel, -	24
right.  #	15
Uh-huh.	15
Because I just watched it on T V one night on one of them, um, Twenty Twenty, Forty-eight# hours, one of them shows# -- -- where this boy had been stealing cars.	24
I can understand that.	21
{C and, } {F uh, } we're also going to have a little roast suckling pig,  because  [ I, + I've ] got one that's got [ a, + a ] hernia --	24
Yeah.	15
every recipe I've tried out of that has been a really good one --	24
Are you satisfied with the quality of coverage?	7
And I still can to this date.	24
Fun for them.	9
{C So. } -	26
# Right. #	15
we're stuck with him for -- -- a little while longer,	36
yeah.	36
{C So } you've been there longer.	24
Okay.	15
Okay,	38
Uh-huh.	15
{C So } you did buy a pattern, and then # started from there. #	22
Yeah.	36
[ Two, + two ] years ago we had a Seder,	24
They have not been too bad.	24
Right.	15
{C And, } -	26
I do tend to throw on HEADLINE NEWS when I'm doing things around the house and just let it play, # and # listen,	24
because my dogs <laughter> chase them.	24
Sure <clicking> <beep>.  <<Talking to someone else or himself.>>	36
<Laughter>.	20
we're really strict with our kids about television,	24
sometimes common sense should take over rather than, -	9
I don't care what weekend, we went and when it was, it always rained on us.	24
# {C but } in Lubbock # we have a few that you can send your children to	24
she's, -	26
Now can she leave, {F um, } on a day by herself?	7
{D Well, } it just seems like in the past three or four years it has just gotten so much worse than it was.	9
Yeah.	26
{C But } {D like }  [ the friends, + other friends ] of mine have cats,	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
-- {C and } you just boil them	24
she and her husband # both do.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
-- have, -	26
# <Laughter>.  #	20
did you see TWIN PEAKS?	7
Yeah.	36
Mostly freshwater,	24
{C and } thanks to a lot of new inventions, housework doesn't take as much time as it used to.	9
{D Well, } I had to,	24
Okay.	29
Right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
and she says things like, I'm really glad when he comes home	24
{F Uh, } {F um. }  Probably, {F uh, } when we go to Wisconsin  ((   )) .	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } [ I'm still, + I'm still ]  puzzled though, what is the argument,	39
if I had my druthers I'd probably say {D well } no	24
{C But, }  {F uh, } I was just talking to somebody else,	24
{C but } on the other hand, it's clean and kind of suburban -- -- little bit more than I want.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } they are.	36
# {C and } # they were nearly [ all, + all ] diesel,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And, } {F uh, } nothing is the same.	9
{C So, } -	26
[ {C So, } +  {C but } ]  I guess they were talking about experiences.	38
when they [ be-, + became ] a country they [ more than,  or, + more  or ] less decided they weren't going to take it anymore,	24
that's, {F uh, } {D you know, }  [ I could, + I could ] have, {D you know, } get something nice and upgrade	24
Yeah.	15
{C But, }  my criteria, is simply something that looks good, something that's serviceable,	24
Is that right?	7
# You still have to, #  {D you know, } -	9
{C or } doesn't really matter.	35
Uh-huh.	15
{F Um, } {C and } this year  [ it, +  it ] happened [ for, +  {F uh, } for ] the daughter.	24
Of course, they, {D you know, } just don't have the quality of records nowadays either because, [ you, + you  ] get that scratchy sound.	9
Yeah,	15
{F uh, } my daughter [ s-, + ] {F uh, } sings with Younger Generation, I don't know if you've ever heard of them.	24
Because [ [ they are, + {E I mean } they've got, ] + they've gotten ] complicated haven't they? <Barking>.	7
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
I didn't hear.	24
{C But, } -	26
yeah,	36
{D Well, } [ that's, + that ] sounds interesting.	21
Before that, it was, {F uh, } death by electrocution.	24
That's the most prevalent crime. {F Uh, } [ the ones that really, + {D you know, } the ones that really ] add up after a while, I guess, {D you know, } [ from, s-, + far as ] insurance money and stuff like that, insurance costs.	9
What kind of singing do you like to do?	39
{C and } I did not order out a lot,	24
yeah,	36
{C but } in order to get in, you have to be able to, {F um, } walk in on your own,	24
{C but } what they do is employ, {F uh, } [ homeless, + {A I think mostly men, but } homeless ] people to {F uh, } go out and collect all the recyclable cans	24
{F Oh, } great,	21
Right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Doesn't Wisconsin have a, {F uh, } state, {F uh, } Medicare program or # health program? #	7
{C And } they can just fill their  plate up at intermission and then go back over there and sit down.	24
{C so } we, -	26
# Uh-huh. #	15
-- {C and } he dressed out to almost two hundred and ten pounds.	24
{C and } I'm from Chicago,	24
{F Oh, } you've got a cold.	2
} right now the lottery here, -	24
Yeah.	15
[ [ I don't, + I don't, ] + [ e-, + ] [ e-, + ] I don't, ] -	26
Okay.	13
# Yeah.  #	15
{D Well, } [ I, + I ]  was going to ask, too, does your wife work?	7
{C and, } {D you know, } # {F Um, } # T I just did the thing  where, with the smoking premiums.	24
Yeah.	15
They will if you attack them.	24
{F Oh, } that's great.	21
Okay,	13
{D So } do you have any recycling programs there?	7
{F Uh, } yeah,	4
Then, [ as the, + {D you know, } as you ]  go up higher, {D like } in your senior level, you're doing projects which [ are, + are ] so big,	9
-- {C but } as long as I was single and had to work, I was going to get a good job and do the best I could.	24
{C Or } maybe [ a ben-, + {F uh, } not really a benefit, ] either, [ but + ] would be the allowing you to use the telephone for personal calls.	9
{F Oh } yeah.	15
I asked the defense attorney later why he didn't bring up all  this other trouble the guy had been in.	9
I think that a lot of [ the, + the ] H E W services, although they're providing necessary services, have too much fat in them.	9
You ever seen that movie?	7
Right.	15
Yeah.	36
Say, -	26
I  ((   ))  gave out my work number --	24
[ it, + it ] really is.	36
{F Huh. }	15
Now I'm T V watching.	24
{C and }  it's not the economics I solely zeroed in on,	24
{F Oh, }	26
{C But } along here it's, {F uh, } [ very + <laughter>, very ] different from the Texas type weather.	24
We have two,	24
{D Well, } [ they, + [ and + ] {E you know, } they're ] also p-, -	26
{C and } things are misspelled	24
they really do.	9
I don't think [ they can, + they can ] force another company to not drug test me just by saying that [ I, + I ] -- -- didn't, {E I mean, } -	9
It was # dig your own hole	24
was that something --   *[[ Seems to be an indep. slash unit ]] -- maybe it was. -  *[[ See note above ]]	7
I've had fishing,	24
I just, {F uh, } have, {D you know, } one brother and he's married,	24
we're having a terrible time with the recession.	24
Is it formal policy that they said they might test?	7
{C so. } -	26
[ {C and } -- + -- {C and, } ] {F uh, } {D you know, } [ [ I'm, + {D you know, } I'm, ] + I'm ] an adult --	24
{D You know, } you {C either } like someone {C or } you don't like someone {C or } you're just completely indifferent <cough>.	9
I don't have to buy jogging shoes all to often	24
{C but } they do what [ they, + they ] # want to do with it. #	9
It talks about, {F um, } race relations and police relations	24
That sounds like not as recent social changes, too,  {D like } back to the sixties or fifties, I guess <noise>.	24
[ we, + we ] really, {F uh, } use most anything.	24
that's true.	9
# {C and } # I think I value [ my, + my ]  education more because I had to work for it.	24
<Throat_clearing>.	20
{D Well } that's okay,	29
-- {C and, } {F uh, } I, -	26
My little boy grew out of it.	24
{C And } the transmission was replaced	24
{C and } there's been some violence because of it.	24
Oh.	15
Yeah.	15
{C And } I had one that was born in December,	24
-- yeah.	26
{C and } they don't have all these modern toys,	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } [ I, + I  ] don't like to go to movies to be scared,	24
{D well } they mow the grass up here sometimes six o'clock in the morning.	24
{C And } that, was mine.	24
{D Well, } no,	33
Yeah,	36
I don't do a lot of deep sea fishing,	24
Do you have pets?	7
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
I like Sean Connery,	24
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } yeah,	21
<child> Gettysburg?	7
It was like four dollars a semester hour --	24
<Laughter>.	20
{D You know, } [ we're, + we're, ] much better off playing, {F uh, } Beethoven's ninth,	25
<dishes>.	20
<yelling> {C but } he, {D you know } -- -- is working at Sam's now.	24
{C But, } {F uh, } -	26
{F Uh. }	26
{C and} they can be taken away by a man,	24
the children <barking> next door just opened the fence	24
[  I'm, + I'm ] one of the manager reps,	24
That really burns me because, {D hey, } you're required.	24
{C so } that, -	26
# {D Well, } I'm sure you do. #	9
What is it that, -	26
{F Uh, } {D well, } here in Texas we, {F uh, } -	24
{F Uh, } uh-huh.	29
Gee whiz.	21
{D Well } we stay within our  means #	30
Right.	36
I've heard that that's really good for you to do.	24
[ this is, + this is ] [ a, + a ] man's trip <laughter>.	24
I'm going crazy,	24
{F uh, } [ they just, + they're ] action filled, and a little bit of humor,	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
I try to  catch it because it's another example,	24
uh-huh.	15
[ I think, + I think ] [ it was, +   it was,  ] [ there were, + there were ] a lot more  demographic related interests involved than true foreign policy interests.	9
I think it's funny.	9
There's no, {F uh, } -	26
That's true,	21
We've probably been on long enough.	9
{C and } I'll probably go outside today and plant that.	24
the Seville is totally different,	24
<Laughter>.	20
I know, my wife and I were first married here	24
all set, then.	24
{F Oh, } wow.	21
It is great.	24
Do you go camping very much?	7
I'm kind of a doubting Thomas	24
<child_laughing>.  #	20
{D Now, } my husband and all the men, {E I mean, } they love the real competitiveness of playing for money, {D you know. }	24
I don't really have much to comment about  it.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and so, } {F uh, } it's important for you to spend time doing the  things that you want them to learn, {D you know, } [ that, +  that ]  they need to learn at the age, {D you know } -- -- [ reading, and, + {F uh, } reading and ]  playing nice with others, and that sort of thing.	9
I'm not sure if they go, {E I mean } to twelve new people or what they do exactly,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
Saddam thought he had the whole thing, {F uh, } figured out [ to, + to ] which way we were coming and [ which, + [ what, + what ] ] our doctrine was  [ that, + ] {F uh, }	9
{C and } the older brother is <laughter> {D you know, } running around all over the place	24
{C but } {D so, } you like food	8
{F Oh, } yeah,	21
It is interesting though,	9
Uh-huh.	15
{D You know, } if you want to be a lawyer  because you know that you can provide a service that people need -- -- because you have to have lawyers in this country,  {F um, }  but if you're just doing it because you think that's the best way to, be rich.	9
I consider myself what they call a full-timer.	24
I see.	29
{C and } [ they were talking {D like, } thousands of cows, {D you know, } + they were talking thousands cows  ] in one little tiny area.	24
<laughter> I've got steamed broccoli down on mine <laughter>.	24
Okay.	15
What would you serve, {F uh, } if you were having a  dinner party?	39
{C and } -- -- everyone enjoyed it.	24
Uh-huh.	15
I don't remember the language.	24
# I know. #	36
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
I agree.	36
my brother has a home there he's trying to sell.	24
[ I, + I've ] actually been there.	24
{C but } you enjoy them,	24
the guy came after him with that big knife.	24
nope,	33
{F Uh, } just since October.	24
[ That's, + that's ] a great deal what law schools like <laughter>.	24
{E I mean, } <<stutters>> {F uh, } {F eh, } {F eh, } {F eh, } [ [ [ I, + I, ] + I, ] + I ] tend to read {D like } only out of a couple, {D you know, } groups.	24
{C And } they, -	26
Apparently I think his  contract is up after the end of this year	9
{C And so } we will just have to see how things work out.	24
It'll seem the news, the Harold Taft, {D you know, } on the local news.	24
Yeah,	36
Randall Cunningham was with Philadelphia, I guess last year,	9
[ The, +  the ] new stuff's kind of more  like, today's rock and roll, which I, don't really care for today's rock and roll too much.	9
Uh-huh.	15
they are about a third of my body weight.	24
{F Um, } a girl walked into a Korean owned store <lipsmack>	24
so obviously you're into education.	8
you too.	38
# Uh-huh. #	36
{F Uh, } we moved here a year ago  <child_talking>.	11
{C and } I have mixed feelings about that.	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ he's a, + he's a ] winner in anyone's book --	9
{C because } in society a lot of people are taking drugs.	9
his descendants  are from, {F uh, } {F uh, } Nicaragua <breathing> and, {F uh, } very, -	24
Right,	36
Yeah,	15
{D Well, } I'm surprised she hasn't told us to cut it off yet.	9
{C and } I haven't seen him since eight o'clock this morning.	24
{F Oh, } {D well, } [ it, + {D you know, } i-, ] -	26
Uh-huh.	15
That's good to hear.	9
It was everything that was started in the sixties.	24
{D Like } if you and another lady were to share the same full time job, or, -	24
Gosh.	21
{D well, } no	32
when I'm being paid.	25
[ {C and, } + <breathing> {C and, } ] {F uh, } he did part of the, [ in the, + ] at night because we were trying to hurry up and get it ready so we could move in,	24
<Throat_clearing>.	20
{C and } I pay it all off.	24
uh-huh.	15
Oh <laughter>.	29
<laughter>.	20
{F Oh, } {F oh, } that's good,	21
[ that, + that ] would be a good deal to go with.	9
you try to layer, so you can add [ [ or, + or -- ] + -- or ] take off.	24
Yeah.	4
Right.	15
# Right. #	15
{D Well, } when you use real people like that, I think -- -- royalty, especially, {D you know. } -	9
{D Well, } that makes sense.	21
the better the place, the more you're going to pay.	9
-- basically a dictator fascist. -	9
it just takes a very long time	24
Yeah.	15
Bye-bye.	38
{F Oh, } I see.	15
{E I mean, } it was, -	24
Right.	15
Yeah,	15
{F Uh, } who's the last one.	14
No.	33
right.	11
Right,	15
[ on the, + # on the ] tracks	2
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Tr-, -	26
Yeah.	15
{F Um, } okay.	29
Do you work to T I?	7
{D well } neither can I,	24
{C but } my dad was so precise, that, {E I mean, } if it said to spend  eleven percent on something that's what it was spent.	24
{D well, } how many, {F uh, } {F uh, } families own a refrigerator,	16
{F Oh, } really?	12
{C so. } -	26
{C and } I was dead set against it <breathing>.	24
One of the reasons is -	26
I don't care how # small the ballot is, {E I  # -- -- mean, } if there's one thing, if there's one issue,	24
it's not, -	26
{C and } we could not get her out of the what she called the <<imitates English accent>> back garden. Because she wanted to go back with a sunburn.	24
{D Well, } I really like, -	24
{E I mean, } I told my dad, [ li-, + Dad listen ] if you want to save money I won't call so often, {D you know, }	24
Sounds like you have a little one just like I do <laughter>.	9
Every one.	30
Uh-huh.	15
And the uranium.	2
I was probably about fourteen.	24
# Yeah. #	4
Yeah.	15
It's through Baxter Labs.  {F Uh, }	24
Didn't get that far.	8
{C and } there's an immediate problem.	9
{D well } basically her thing was just don't do it, {D you know } --	24
{C but } hey, he's carrying just as much firepower as I can.	25
like  in Nicaragua, I am familiar with that <throat_clearing>  because we have, {F uh, } some friends that live on the Nicaraguan border	24
{C and} I guess I would fall more in [the, + the] realm that I like the sport issue of it,	9
{D Well, } my bills  I usually know approximately how much they're going to be.	24
{F Oh, } yeah,	4
[ {C and, } +  {C and } ] also, {F um, } [ the, + the ]  thing I don't like about a lot of these court trials  and a lot of these appeals is that it's not based on what is true and what is false	9
{D Well } you have to have the telephone,	9
the, ((hell)) -	26
Yeah.	15
{F Uh, } [ h-, + how ]  is that going to affect the, {F uh, } sports weapons?  {E I mean, } rifles, that are automatic or semiautomatic?	39
Yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C but, }  {F uh, } I guess it's close enough <laughter>.	9
It wasn't that long ago,	24
Uh-huh.	15
it keeps you busy, doesn't it?	7
Yeah.	15
so, that's, <talking> [child_talking] <rattling> -	26
Yeah.	15
<Laughter> Maybe I should have just traded the car in.	24
{C and } we want that,	25
Uh-huh.	15
#More money (( )),#  -	26
{C and, } {F uh, } it's just remarkable how close it will match the paint, {F uh, }	24
{C So } that worked out very nicely.	24
Yeah,	15
{C And, }  {F uh, } I guess you can al-,	24
{C and } she doesn't know who she is	9
do we have to speak for a  certain amount of time?	7
{D You know. }  {C And } I'm sure it'd be even less for somebody with a good gun.	9
{C or } do you think they are deliberate sorts of things?	35
<noise>.  Yeah.	15
# I'm sure. #	24
{F Uh, } <laughter>  I, -	26
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } -	26
Not inside.	5
Yeah,	15
{C And } it's easy to trans-, -	9
Yes.	36
No.	30
{C because, } {F oh } gosh [ [ they, +  the, ] +  {F uh, } this ]  fellow's wife who was, {F uh, } watching the dog, [ pro-, + ] [ she, +  I think she ] loved that dog more than I did	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } I think most women walk in [ [ and, + and, ] + and ] with, {F Oh, } got to clean all this up.  Got to get this out and this in and this, {D you know, } taken care of, instead of having someone say -- -- now, [ this needs to be do-, + this is the time this needs -- -- to be done, ]	9
[ what do you, + do you ] have any feelings as to the trends that you see?	7
Yeah,	15
How's he handling that?	39
# Uh-huh. #	15
that's right.	36
{C and  -- -- then } that's another forty bucks, plus whatever else he decides to do to you,	9
Yeah,	15
I used to smoke, {D you know } --	24
that's okay.	27
# That's true. #	36
{F Uh, } this is when they were having their revolution -- -- or whatever	24
Uh-huh.	15
I think they've learned some real good life skills.  {F Uh, } {D you know, } being -- -- involved in all those things.	24
they just came up with a twenty-five percent increase on personal property [ in, + in ] Oklahoma county and that is a chunk.	24
{D You know, } why not <laughter>.	16
# Oh. #	15
{C and } [ I, + I ] vote as often on absentee as I can because it's so easy now.	24
{C And } little boys are around the house -- -- a whole lot more than girls.	24
Most of them don't even try to ge-, you know, to go out.	24
I'm not that dedicated.	24
except heavy metal	24
{C And, }  {F uh, } I guess for places I like  to go, I enjoy going to the beach and [ [ having, + having outdoor, ] + being outdoors ] somewhere.	24
I like them.	24
Yeah.	15
{C and, }  {F um, } they attend the public school here and are very active in a lot of the sports, soccer and  baseball	24
<Laughter>.	20
[ I'm again-, +  I'm against ]  this, {F uh, } automatic and # semiautomatic stuff. #	24
<Laughter> Yeah,	15
Right.	15
I know, it's too bad that they've gotten so expensive.	9
{C But } my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly.	9
Uh-huh.	36
{C but } I got up.	24
Okay.	29
Yeah,	15
No,	36
I think that, {D you know, } -	9
they even hate to give out unemployment -- -- at the end of tax season because -- -- [ [ they, + {D you know, } they're ] + fairly, even though they're ] a large scale company, [ [ they're very, + the offices, ] + the individual offices are ] very small --	24
What kind of things have you read?	39
What do they have to do with one another?	39
I know they have a waiting list and a quota on immigration now.	24
Yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C so, } -	26
Go during the day,	22
{C because } I've got it all cut out,	24
Yes,	4
Huh-uh,	36
{C and } we budget them into what we call [ our, + our ] needs and wants list.	24
[ they're, + they're ] pretty handy because, {D you know, } when I travel, it's easy to check messages,	24
they have been.	9
yeah.	15
uh-huh.	15
[ We, + we ] really, -	24
# {C but, } they're # retired, {D you know, }	9
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } it was too crowded --	9
{F Oh, } yes.	15
{F Uh, } band.	24
{D like } half day # programs.	2
{F Um, } [ [ y-, + {D well, } you, ] + {D you know, } <laughter> you're ] talking to part of them that's paying for that <laughter>.	9
{C And, } {F uh, } I've driven it a few times	24
{C but } supposedly they're good,	24
{D Now, } there are times when you'd -- -- at least think you do, anyway.	24
Are you?	12
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
[ {C and, } + {D you know, } [ {C and, } + {F uh, } # {C then, } # ] ] I go to the kitchen and cook,	24
{C and } I'm in California visiting right now.	6
{C and } there was this fellow in this truck that kept circling the block.	24
# [ {D Well, } +  # {D Well, } ] when I was still smoking,  [ I, + I ] felt that way.	24
{E I mean, } what they'd be teaching in an Arlington school they may not be teaching in a Plano school --	24
[ [ I-, + i-, ] + it ] was a computer subsidiary.	24
So it's sort of a thumbing of the nose, uh, approach.	9
<Laughter>.	20
# if # your neighbor is having an argument you can here it blow for blow.	24
{C And, } {D you know, } the whole electronic # classroom idea. #	24
{F Oh, } Garland, Texas,	29
{F Oh, } that is great.	21
{C or }  is this something that maybe learning phonetics,	35
maybe so.	40
{D Well, } that's exactly the way  he feels is that, he really hates to spend the time,	24
{C And } they can't believe that they could survive it.	24
I like  the director a lot, {F um, } a guy named Tim Burton.	24
{F Oh, } you're in New York,	24
[ How f-, + how far ] are you from Houston?	39
{E I mean, } [ there, +  these ]  were like some mutant.	9
Oh, ((   )) .	15
{C and } he put it  on the little thing he has in there to test them	24
{D well, } I found that [ they, + they ] have just a much better program than the other shows that are on T V.	9
{D Well, } ironically enough I'm sitting  here with a cast on my leg because I resumed an aerobics class the night before last.	24
{C and, }  {D boy, } I could, -	26
{D Well } you too,	38
{C but. } -	26
{F Uh, } I used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of  [ fre-, +  different types of freons, ]	24
one of the unique things in this  it's like a pound of ground beef some bread crumbs  {F um } an egg {F um } whatever seasonings	24
I don't know.	34
I was wondering what you do at T I.	28
{D you know, } they, {F uh, } nobody vo-, -	26
What do you think about, {F uh, } {D you know, } -	31
Okay.	29
{C and }  I've done everything from build the motor from [ the, + {F uh, }  {D you know, } the ] bare block on up.	24
I think it's really important to [ that, + that ] if you get a pet that they're {C either } spayed {C or } neutered so that, {D you know, } we're not just going on with this pet population and having to, just get rid of them.	9
I think, {F uh, } individually, {F uh, } just by the vast number of people   there are, [ there's + ] I think cars are also a major contributor to it.	9
# {C or } # the computers, [ the, + the ] big advent of that,  I believe, because [ it, + they ] can all hold such large data bases on anybody that all you have to do is touch a button -	9
((   ))  the latest cereal about,  {D you know, } th-, -	9
[ [ If, + if, ] + if ] they keep giving  everybody hundred year sentences, and the people in various states, it does not seem that  people want to be taxed to build more prisons.  Or even [ in, + ] for that matter,  {F uh, } repair [ the, + {F uh, } the ] lack of judges [ [ and, + and, ] + and ] other, {F uh, } -	9
{D Well, } the smart half was don't pay it for consumables,	9
{C and } we're going to  try to see if we can pickle our own	24
Oh.	15
It makes it so much lighter.	24
exactly.	36
you see, {F uh, } more and more ladies of all ages with briefcases [ and, + {F uh, } and ] in their business suits [ and -- + -- and ] going. -	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } yeah,	36
# I # think that's a good,	9
(( {F Oh, } no )) ,	21
Uh-huh.	15
-- {C and } she's much, -	26
Yeah,	15
{F Uh, } {D well } actually not.	5
{C and, } I don't know	19
Right.	15
-- several of  the things you mentioned  were the things that, {F uh, } our son has talked a lot about Texas A and M.	24
{F Oh, } [ I'm, + I'm ] a dog person.	24
You bet,	21
Not really rationing water, but just cutting down.	24
[ It's too, +  {F um, } {F um, } it's ]   attacking just certain people.	9
Right.	15
# Right,	36
{C But } my youngest son is a skier.	24
Years ago it would have been fine	9
you'd really open a can of worms.	9
Uh-huh.	15
And put s-, speaker phones in it.	24
[ {C but, } + {C but } ] recently I have been following the Middle East rather than, Central America <<very faint>>.	24
Okay <child_crying>.	29
{F Um, } {F um. }	26
# okay. #	15
{C and } they took a big huge bin that has paper and plastic, {F um, } and put it in front of the Wal-Mart store in town,	24
Right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C And, } they both loved the movie, right?	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and, } -	26
{C and } he never ever thought of, {F uh, } not going to school he said, in view of the fact that he was  certain I had a hot line to his school. # Because, {F uh, } I, {F uh, } # -	24
{C And then } at that point, # quit # spending on space.	9
Yeah.	15
-- that would have meant a total attack of the Iraq country within, {D you know, } three hours of when the weapon was shot.	9
{F Uh, }	15
{C and } during the  Christmas holidays we'd go down to our house on the coast --	24
right.	23
{C but } # -- -- {F uh, } I live in Orlando, Florida usually.	24
{C but } that -	26
Go over there and rebuild all those.	22
{F Oh, } I don't know, [ they're, + they're ] not as nice looking.	9
It goes back and forth.	24
{C and } it talks about how, {D you know, } if we could just all get toge-, {D you know, } -	24
[ No, +  no ] state income tax.	24
They definitely do.	36
Do you like the way it rides and stuff?	24
If you look at, {F um, } Iraq for example -- -- and {D you know } the recent thing with the U N going in there -- -- and [ the, + the ] bomb development and all this kind of stuff, {D you know. }	9
[ That look like, + it looks like ] a sticker	24
we sell,	24
{F Oh } is that right?	12
I just keep  thinking all the time -	24
{C but, } -	26
Yeah.	15
Most really care, in this center, really care.	24
I even had friends  when I was going to college who were in, {F uh, }  ((   ))  pharmacy school	24
{C and } [ we, +  early in life, we ] discovered that six  people all going on vacation gets to be very, very expensive.	24
All it [ was, + was, ] {D you know, } -	24
it changed my understanding of the world around me --	24
Uh-huh.	15
It's definitely, -	26
{C but, } {F uh, } there's got to be a lot of potential down there.	9
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] {F uh, } [ yo-, + ] {D you know, } that they  (( called )) interaction between  people and (( sort of ))  to use as, {F uh, } as a way of getting people to talk about their problems,	24
{C and } there weren't that many deaths.	24
[ {C Or, } + {C or } ] what do you think?	31
{C but } I get -- -- to see pretty much, {F uh, } close up, {D you know, } a lot of things that happen that people don't see.	24
{C And } that's  ((   )) . -	26
Yeah,	4
You have a good evening, all right?	38
huh-uh.	33
#Yeah.#	36
# Yeah. #	15
Mitch Snider is [ the, + the ] advocate for the homeless that, {F uh, } [ he, + he's ]  said it out here in Washington	24
I like to hunt,	24
Yeah.	15
E-, -	26
{C but } it was just unreal.	24
That's not always true.	32
Right.	15
No.	33
<Breathing>.	20
Linda.	5
{C But, } [ we, + we ] did buy a can crusher	24
Yes.	36
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
Have you seen DANCING WITH WOLVES?	7
we [ just, + just ]  love them to death.	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } I'm really glad she did	24
# Huh.  #	15
I have known a lot of people that would go to school and their parents paid for it	24
what it's going to cost sixteen years from now is just really scary.	24
Yeah.	15
# sure it is. #	21
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	15
I think that's true.	36
we had a <breathing> review with the nursing home staff.	24
{C but } it's part of the inspection sticker, {D you know, }	24
{F Uh, } the questions is concerning the changes in the roles of American women in the past several generations {C and } {D you know, } in [ their, + ] the society we live in.	24
[ I, + I ] don't know what it is about the enchiladas.	24
Yeah,	15
Yeah,	15
[ Have you, + have you  ] tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to have something painted?	7
{C So } you got, -	24
what gets me is I can't believe that [ Congress, + {F uh, } {E or, } our state legislature ] can't come up with, {F uh, } some kind of workable means to have funds for the school.	9
{C But } [ I was, + [ I, + I ] was ] staying in the realm [ of, + of ] felonies versus misdemeanors -- -- and, {F uh, } drug use,	24
Really.	15
It was on network T V a couple of times.	24
[ It's like, + it's like ] a vampire (( sometimes ))  # <laughter>. #	24
# Yeah.	15
{D Well, } it's not every week,	24
Right.	15
Yeah.	36
{D You know, } there's so many different options and so many different prices and who has this cash back and whatever.	24
I'm not, so much against their making, {F uh, } it a state.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } my sister's real interested in that [ and, + and ] getting into [ [ the, + to ] + that ] side of nursing.	24
# Uh-huh.  #	15
{C and, }  {F oh, } what is that guy's name?	1
{D Well, } there, {D well } supposedly, -	9
{D like, } give me some examples.	18
{F Oh, } that sounds good.	21
{F Oh } [ the, + the ] carpet place that called me three times, -	24
tell me about the car that you've got.	18
{E or } [ th-, + ]  one of their articles was on recycling,	24
because if, <laughter> we, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
so do I.	24
# {D So, } where do you see, # us changing in the future?	39
[ [ It is, + it is, ] + it is, ] {F uh, } interesting, {F uh, } with the computer to read the computer news and, all that.	9
that's the way it is here in Colorado, also.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } first of all, -	26
[ I can see, +  I can see  ] the, {F uh, } {D you know, } -	26
# Okay,	38
Yeah,	15
[ [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] + {F uh, } {C so, } ] [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] appreciate his too, [ his,  + his  ] mus-, -	24
{F Oh, } yeah,	15
I think, {D you know, } because [ the, + {F um, } the ] teachers are overworked	9
I think you could  drive along in Maryland and  look at the sweet gum trees on each side [ and the, + and the ]  pines and what not,	9
{C so } it's, [ a, + a ] complete random testing	24
<Laughter>.	20
I'm an engineer.	24
The first Sunday in October, the Jordan family gets together.	24
[ I, + I ] realize that this is your identification	24
# I agree. #	36
Right.	36
{C and } doctor's are available if they need them.	24
let's see, [ it, +  it ]  shelters you're money that you pay [ for, +  for ] insurance.	24
{C and } we play three days in a row, three different courses	24
once you're inside, you don't know you're in a town home.	24
# Yeah. #	15
[ {C Or, } + {C or } ] government aids and stuff.	9
those are nice.	9
Yeah	36
{D So, } sometimes I ask myself, what are, {F uh, } people doing that are in the media -- -- when somebody, {D you know, } comes up to office,	24
Yeah.	15
At last, someone wants us to vote.	24
Yeah.	15
{D like, } for example, baseball,	26
{C But } <squeak> it really makes you wonder what other lists you're own that have been made, {F uh, } public that you, don't know about.	9
I think that was, -	9
{C and } it was really kind of interesting <<pause>>.	24
If I get busy <laughter> I don't get a chance to pick it up,  like this week I noticed  several copies [ have been un-, + haven't been touched ]	24
I just, -	26
{C but } I feel like they were neglected.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I don't think a lot of people, {D you know, } realize [ a lot, + the plight of a lot  ] of people. {D You know, } {C and } you may be in good standing and everything may look hunky-dory to you, # but there's so many more people, # {D exactly, } [ that you don't even, +   *[[slash marks right? Should there be one after 'exactly'?]] [ and + ] that you don't even  ] see or know about.	9
Right,	15
# That's the way # it is at my daughter's nursery school too.	24
{C So, } {D you know, } changing the oil, changing the spark plugs -	24
{C But, } {D you know, } evening time it gets pretty busy.	24
{C So } it's getting people clean out their closets and such.	24
{F Uh, } I've painted several houses, inside.	24
they, {D you know, } -	26
<Child_talking> {C But } do you guys have fishing competitions while you are there?	7
{C So } the first, {D you know, } -	26
Then, {F uh, } I saw AWAKENING,	24
<Child_talking>.	20
[ you wou-, + you do ] when you mo-.	26
# Uh-huh. #	15
Yes.	15
right.	36
Yeah.	15
Probably so, on publicity and letting realtors know and key people how wonderful the schools are --	36
{C and } I just called the credit card company and explained to them the situation,	24
Yeah.	15
<laughter>.	20
{D well } {D see, } [ I, + [ m-, + my ] ] oldest is nine	24
{C So } [ it's not a + it's not a ]  thick <lipsmack> rich type of a sauce	24
I look at it	24
I guess that about does it.	9
{E I mean }  [ they, + they're ] trying to get more people into that field.	24
No.	30
Yeah.	15
That's the woman's role,	9
{C and } I'm still going,  {D you know, } {F oh } my God, I'm [ s-, + ] getting so old.	24
Yeah.	15
{C And, }  [ [ [ I, + I, ] + I, ] + I ] think  it's better for everybody if we had better schools.	9
What do you have?	39
Uh-huh,	15
{C but } I have  never done it myself.	24
Yeah.	15
Okay, {F oh, }	29
{C So } this is just really strange <laughter>.	24
{C so } it just turned out to be [ [ too much of a, + too much, ] + <throat_clearing>  too much ] cooking.	24
{C and } when I was looking for the nursing homes, another thing that I learned, {F uh, } -	24
I'm a big baseball fan too.	24
{D Well, } especially, {D you know, } {D well, } -	26
{C but } they don't do it.	24
{C But } that's, {F uh, } -	26
{F Oh, } no,	36
Right.	15
I don't think that the way I get the news is the right  way to get it.	9
[ They're, +  {F um, }   *[[slash error?]] {D Yeah, }  they're ] pretty nice,	24
{C And } my number one pet peeve in a  magazine, is when they put the perfume in it -- -- because, {F uh, } real often, I don't like very heavy perfumes --	24
{C and } I don't have anyone else at home,	24
[ Over in T, + {E I mean } for T I ] but over in Italy.	24
Great.	21
{C but } it's something that, -	24
{C And } [ that's, + that's ] what I basically, {F uh, } view a nursing home as, a warehouse,	9
{C But } [ they, + so   they ] weren't, {D you know. }	24
Oh <laughter>.	15
I see.	15
{C or } if you don't want to build a data base to keep track of the <<pause>> nuts and bolts in your garage,	9
{F Oh, } it was nice talking with you, too.	38
{C but, } -	26
Too often I feel that people get off, {F uh, } without, -	9
{C but } [ it still, + it still ] is a problem.	24
Yeah,	36
How did that compare with this   area as far as [ house-, +  housing ] prices?	39
{D Well, } I have all sons, so I think I'm probably going to be fishing for a long time <laughter>.	24
I used to live in Iowa too,	24
Yeah.	15
That's why I thought, {D well, } {D you know, } this is the time.	24
The victim is really, seems like left out in the cold, more or less, doesn't it,	9
-- {C and then, } {D you know, }  we put I guess it's {D like } fifteen to twenty percent into a savings account.	24
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C so }  ] we really have been fairly happy [ wi-, + with ] things,	24
{F Uh, } [ we live right, +   might say we live right ] [ in, +  {F uh, } in ] the middle of a residential area.	24
and, -	26
{C And } I think that's really good because they're learning to like all different kinds	24
{F Um. }	15
-- otherwise I really don't care that much,	24
Yeah,	36
That's right <laughter>.	36
i-, -	26
That's right.	36
{D Well, } [ I'm a, + I'm a ] practicing vegetarian	24
[ My, + actually my ] husband and I are taking a class at our local junior college called [ micro, + micro ] computers one o one	24
Probably so	36
{C and } some of it's still in the freezer	24
They used to leave my cigarettes in the glove compartment.	24
{D well } that's always a good plan.	21
He, -	26
Yeah.	36
{C or, } {F uh, }  I don't know, # {D you know, }	19
{C so } I did cook a little, {D you know. }	24
{C And } I was not very happy with the results.	24
Uh-huh.	4
I agree with that.	36
[ [ Is, +  are we, ] +  should we ]  still be there even, {D you know? }	7
Yeah.	15
I think that if somebody else picks him up, -	9
[ I, + I ] used to go to a gym, {F um, } last summer,	24
be-, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } that's about all I have to say <laughter>.	38
Bonus,	30
Yeah,	15
"I hate reading the directions."""	25
{C so, } {F um, } mostly {D like } when we go out, {D you know, }   it's my husband and I,	24
what is brisket?	39
{C and } we've pretty much planned that  we'll be here in the Dallas area	24
{C so, } [ it was, + it was ] quite a lot of fun.	9
{C and } we called up the company  and asked them details on it.	24
Yeah,	15
{C and } it appears to work fine for the normal colds and things like that,	9
I can't seem to communicate with a cat like I can with my dog.	9
Yeah.	4
-- with the small babies. -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } I just, {D you know, } -	26
Right.	15
{C and, } {F um, } I had never had saki.	24
Nothing real bad, you know,	24
[ [ you, + it's, ] + it's ] hard sometimes at work because, {D you know, } people say, {F oh, } we're taking a cruise,	24
those where you built {D like } a rafter thing.	24
{C but, } {F uh } -- -- my son works for a computer company, the National Institute of [ [ s-, + s-, ] + something, ]	24
sir.	24
{D Well, } {D you know } [ [ they, +  they -- ] + -- they've ] started towards a little  bit of the debit card,	24
{E I mean, } [ [ it was, +  it was, ] +  I guess it was ] pretty bad times.	9
Yeah,	4
they got thrown right into the total mainstream --	9
Yeah.	36
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
I've been, -	26
[ [ {D Well, } + {D Well, } ] +  {D okay, } {D well } ] {D like } my oldest brother, [ he's, + he's ] twenty-four,	24
The scrambles are fun.	9
{F Oh, } goodness.	21
{C and then } the rest is whatever you want to put in.  If you put more than that or something like that.	24
-- {C and } each case is presented to that group of twenty-five,	9
They're on weekdays at eleven o'clock every day. Monday through Friday incase you're interested in that.	24
Yeah.	15
{C so } [ I, + I've ] had an I B M clone, I guess, for a couple of years now, which I've been trying, continually upgrading I guess.	24
{C and } {D you know, }  {D like } you think of lizards doing but  they don't do that.	24
No,	36
{C but } <breathing> you can't have a garden,	9
Probably <laughter>.	24
Wonder if it was by one of those  famous writers,  {D you know }	24
{C And, } {D you know, } [ to, + to ] see their concentration and yet to see [ them, + ] how friendly they are when they're, walk by you, {D you know, }  and -- -- how good they are to their spectators.	24
Maybe they should pay more attention  [ to these trade, + {E or, } {D you know, } to the more equalization of the trade. ]	9
{C but } we can do our part <laughter> -- -- take an extra minute or two.	9
Yeah.	4
{C so. } [ We've, +  we've ] kind of had a variety  there	24
You were a bookkeeper <laughter>.	22
{F Oh, } [ I gue-, +  I think ]  we rented PRETTY WOMAN -- --  a couple [ weeks, +  months ] ago.	24
Do you do any other crafts or anything besides your sewing?	7
<Noise>  <<sounds like in a room filled with people>> What do you think about the benefits in jobs?	31
{C But } that's just kind of, -	26
it's just, a mental concept that I have. Yeah,	24
[ That's a, + that's a ] good idea.	21
Yeah,	15
{C and } they're never going to let liquor in there.	24
No, [ I  had-, + I hadn't. ]	33
Oh.	15
we can't even make English a  national language here in our country.	9
Right.	11
Yeah,	36
nice speaking to you.	38
Okay,	13
I guess our five minutes are up according to me.	24
{C or } I didn't used to	24
[ You want -- + -- you want ] a nincompoop jury because  they'll sympathize with you a bit -- -- as well as hopefully being honest people  and do their best to comply with the facts as they were presented to them.	9
I wish I could move somewhere where, this, you know, you got to like in the country.	9
[ I, + {F uh, } I ] think we've been doing a pretty good job, {D you know, }  [ not, + {F uh, } not  ]  taking advantage [ of our, + {D you know, } of  ] the financial dependence that most of the countries have on us,  {D you know, } {F uh, }	9
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } he was found guilty,	24
{C and } I think that sometimes it's [ too easy of a, + I don't know, to easy of an ] answer.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	4
Yeah.	15
they don't have the hard body.	9
Yeah.	15
Okay,	26
In Iowa, the state I am from -- -- {F uh, } I believe it has gone up to a dollar now.	24
{F uh, } I'm a contract programmer.	24
{F Oh, } I guess the work force would be the main, wouldn't it.	7
{D Well, } even at that point, most care can be given [ at, +  in ] the home.	9
my sister's a principal at a school,	24
{C but } <breathing>, {F uh, } I haven't got to the end of it yet where it asks all that salary information and everything,	24
Right.	15
Is it  ((   )) ? -	7
Uh-huh.	15
Kind of, -	26
Yeah,	15
Yeah.	15
Yeah	15
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
# I believe # -- -- it's something like that,	19
{C but, }  {F uh, } I do know that they are notorious for paroling <laughter> people.	24
{C and } fortunately he was able to, -	24
the American people, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
<Laughter> Yeah,	36
{C but } it's really true,	9
{F Uh, } I trained [ my, + {F uh, } my ]  wife in the hou-, [ in, + in ] doing things,	24
# Yeah. #	15
I have heard it's a rough age to put them into a, -	24
It's real nice,	24
Are  [ you  on, + you on ] any leagues now?	7
{F Oh, } that's interesting.	21
{F Uh, } how about you?	31
THELMA AND LOUISE,	24
Yeah,	4
{D Well, } I've just, -	26
-- {C and } [ that's, + that ] same subject, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
it's not free,	24
{C because } [ they, + they  ] know that you're biased.	9
{C so } he transferred -- -- to U C L A.	24
Oh.	15
It seems to hold up a little bit better towards the nicks and dings -- -- as opposed to, {F uh, } a latex type paint.	24
Course it eliminates any waiting period.	24
Sherman.	24
I have to be real careful about where I put things,	24
and the speaker in the passenger seat.	24
when you're in college, boy. You got a hundred things going on.	24
{D well, } they need guidance	9
{F Uh, } {D you know, } I guess last time I did it before that was college, which was about ten years ago.	24
{C and then } I use that for food, household expenses,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Oh.	15
That's excellent # because, # -	9
#  (( Bro-, )) . # yeah.	13
That's right.	36
{C But } it won't have  [ can  any, +  {F uh, } any ] bad stuff.	24
and the, uh, Senator said do you see that hospital over there?	24
{D Well, } we place a real high priority on education  in our family.	24
{C and } kindergarten starts at eleven thirty	24
Uh-huh.	15
-- [ Like, + like ] I said at the  beginning I've got so many connections with people in Central America.	24
[ I, + I ] received a call last night  because of the, {F uh, } -	24
and they need some assistance down there	9
So they say <laughter>.	19
{F Uh, } [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] I'm not sure how you go about really finding out what people are really like before you vote for them.	24
That's true,	36
{C But } not all country.	3
Huh-uh.	15
{C or, } -	26
# {F Uh, } I love to read.	24
{F Um. }	15
{D You know, } you, -	26
{C but } so, that's  ((   )) , -	26
Do they go to a day-care center	7
Because, {E I mean, } there are some, {E I mean, } -	26
{C And, }  {F uh, } <laughter>. -	26
{C and } they're pretty close.	9
It's, -	26
Yeah,	15
they, they know that by pumping that poison into our system -- -- that that's the way to bring us to our knees, more on their level.	9
[ W-, + we're ] on finances,	18
{C but, } we feel [ like, + like ] the first year needs to be devoted to, {F uh, } making the family,  the couple strong -- -- and secure in their love for each other.	24
{C but } I want <<pause>>, maybe -	26
we, we sold or we, we traded in our Le Sabre for our Subaru.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	36
[ We don't, + we don't ] do enough.	24
It's kind of a vicious circle isn't it?	7
How, -	26
FIELD OF DREAMS was good,	9
{C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } [ it's, + {F oh, } it's ] just  (( blissfull ))  that they're both, able to do everything for themselves.	9
I have [ another number that allows me, + another program that allows me ] to add all the numbers I want,	24
Do you -- -- work now?	7
{F Uh, } I remember being, {D you know, } taught,	24
# {C and } [ never seen, + I've # never seen ] CASABLANCA and never seen GONE WITH THE WIND.	24
It does tend [ to, + to, ] -	9
They'll break in [ at the day, + in the daytime, ]	24
# {E I # mean, } he just turned forty,	24
{C And } they're fun.	9
# Definitely. #	36
{E I mean, } {D you know, } in that  he doesn't really enjoy it,	24
So, uh, we had to sell it.	24
Yeah,	15
[ It, + it's, ] -	26
Uh-huh.	15
[ They, + they ] really do,	36
we don't support them, nothing,	9
{F Oh, } I do, too <laughter>.	24
{F Oh, } they don't take vegetable cans.	30
I've got, {F uh, } -	26
[ w-, + when ] we were in  [ Oah-, + Oahu, ] {F uh, } I couldn't wait to get off <laughter>.	24
Okay.	38
yeah. #	15
it seems like you make those payments every month	9
{C so } it seems to me [ that, + that, ] {F um, } there needs to be [ some ground, + {D you know, } some rules ] -- -- that protect.	9
it is.	36
I am from a small town too here in Texas -- -- [ and so + ] that [ then + ] {D like } local news is really who grew the biggest tomato	24
but I imagine if it's that cold in Dallas it, -	9
bye-bye.	38
<laughter> {C or } the phone rang [ or, + ] {D you know, } at the wrong time <laughter>.	13
{D Well, } good.	21
All right.	13
# Are they # {D like } pretty much train for a specific job	7
I hadn't even thought of that.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C because } -- -- we just can't afford it anymore.	24
{C So } [ I'm {C either } going to be, + I'm {C either } going to starve ] to death	9
{D Well, } do you think, {F uh, } -	26
{D anyway, } {C so } you might as well not, reinforce it <laughter>, {D you know. }	9
[ It, + it ] was.	11
Uh-huh.	15
[ I u-, + I used ]  to take MCCALL'S and GOOD HOUSEKEEPING and, {F uh, } several magazines like that a few years ago [ [ at, + at, ] + at ] home.	24
It, -	26
{C So } you figure one of these days you're going to go back to being an engineer?	8
{F Uh, } quite large,	21
Me, too.	24
{C So } we're, budgeting, {F uh, } each month, {F uh, } an allowance for his education -- -- starting now.	24
{F Um. }	26
my car is the first one we ever bought new, too.	24
{E I mean } they were so rude about it.	24
That's between Houston and Dallas.	24
{C so, } {F uh, }  ((   ))  been a different turn,	9
{C and } we know which month we'll enough saved to go buy those.	24
-- {C and } we're finding out, -	24
Oh.	29
{C And } she gets paid for that	24
It really does.	24
{C and } they just, -	26
{C and } I need to find  some place I could go and not feel like there's all these people who are just huge  and hulking that are ... -	24
-- {C so. } -	26
My son's getting to be [ a, + a ]  real good cook	24
{F Uh, } yes.	4
{C so } I probably do.	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } if [ we want, + {D well } in our area,  if we want ] to use it, [ we have to, + {D you know, } like you said,  you had to ] change it, put it on a disc, And carry it over to there, and see if they're  not using the printer,	24
he says, {D well } the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them.	24
{C and } right now my nine year old is taking piano,	24
{F Uh, }  [ if + sometimes, if  ] you charge, -	24
<Throat_clearing>  Yeah,	15
it's just, {F uh, } -	26
{D Well, } that's good.	21
All the way to North Carolina.	24
it's good to talk to you, too.	38
# {C and, } # {F uh, } we have, {F uh, } some pretty selective admissions requirements for incoming freshmen.	13
he has two ponds up there	24
Uh-huh,	15
I liked, -	26
{E I mean, } we're basically, {D you know, } kind of throwing seven hundred dollars a month away.	24
<Throat_clearing>.	20
{C and } it's, # never # really works out.	24
absolutely,	36
{D you know, } they've got  {D like } a lot of head of cattle because dairies they don't [ th-, + th-,  ] -	24
{E I mean, } [ we, + we ] had a car once  that we tried to have declared a lemon under the lemon law -- -- which is -- -- extremely difficult to do.	24
{F Um, } what is that called?	39
{D Well, } -	26
{D you know, } a lot of people, {F uh, } {F uh, } -	26
Uh-huh.	4
{D You know, } they're just, -	26
{F Uh, } sit-ups	24
Yeah.	36
That's pretty good,	21
{C and } you'd get our money back	24
[ They don't, + they don't ]  even start growing until [ May, + May ] or April, {D like } after it's been  raining for a few months.	24
Uh-huh.	15
they finished pretty close to five hundred last year didn't they?	7
{C and } I look through, {F uh, } -	24
Bye.	38
<Laughter>.	20
{C but } the idea -- -- {D yeah, }  that he had suggested [ that, + that ] maybe they could reduce the number of administrators [ and, + and ] some of the people who were administrators saying, [ [ that, + that, ] + {F uh, } that's ] not what he was hired for.	24
he's outgrown that one a little bit,	24
Uh-huh,	36
{C So, } that's another example of the invasion  because of the not so ... -	26
Right.	15
Yeah,	15
I couldn't <child_laughing>. #	24
My father was on staff there,	24
{C but } [ I, + I ] don't really think those things happen too often because, like I said, from what's reported in the news, at least, [ it's, + it's ] not all that common.	9
Uh-huh.	15
have a good evening.	38
[ the way kids, +  the way kids ] are, {D you know, } {E I mean, } they can, {D you know. } -	9
Went to Alcatraz.	24
the press has a lot of power.	9
{D You know, } there's a lot of times my house may not be as clean as I particularly like  it	24
{D Now } that's all fine and well [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } good philosophical.	9
{E or } [ with the, + with the ] Continental, {F uh, } I [ was, +  rented ] [ one, +  one ] time -- -- {F uh, } we could, {F uh, } put golf clubs in them.	24
Huh-uh.	15
<Noise>.	20
No,	38
Salvia.	30
{D well, } I watch my husband swing	24
Yeah,	15
Right,	36
Right.	15
{F Uh, } I went to the Naval Academy.	24
Go ahead.	18
# {F um, } # I can't remember what type of trees  they are,	24
Yeah <laughter>.	4
I don't think it's very t-, -	26
Yeah.	15
{D you know, } we've had, # those # for a long time.	24
Yeah.	15
{F Uh, } in the Houston area.	24
[  My, + my ] neighbor has gone before -- -- [ and, + and ] done that,	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C but, } [ it, + it ] was always fun.	24
{E I mean, } I know that they're causing massive problems in society up here,	9
{C but } that's my first trip back in, {F oh, } goodness, {F um, } {F um, }  thirty years maybe <laughter>.	24
Uh-huh,	15
{C and, } -	26
I have a nephew.	24
it was a pretty good movie.	9
That's interesting.	21
yeah,	26
[ {C And } + {C but, } ] -	26
{D well, } [ he did, +   he had ] [ a, + a ] red <beep> Miata,	24
[ an, + {C but } ] [ now, + now, ] that he's in this program and, {D you know, } he's, I guess okay,	24
{C And } I like the light meals.	24
{C and, }   it was beautiful, beautiful few days.	24
[ {C And, } + {C or } ] we'd hunt pine cones -- -- {C or } we climbed some, {F uh, } pinon pines one year and gathered the cones so  that we could eat the pine nuts.	24
-- {C but } I still think in lots of job markets they are not treated as equals.	9
{C and } I have been debating what to cook because one of my guests is a vegetarian.	24
{C And } they said that between three and four hundred have been stolen.	24
{C And } I don't know too much about the air pollution thing.	24
Yeah.	15
I have to go to a business meeting once a month with him,	24
she's not entirely sales, so [ it isn't, + it isn't ] as lucrative as one would hope,	24
it's kind like this, {F uh, } box shape,	24
I bet.	21
{D So, } -	26
I don't.	24
{C so } there's your good dessert for your dinner party.	24
uh-huh. <sniffing>	4
{C And } -- --  ((   )) [ wha-, + what's ] kind of next.	16
it's straight	24
<laughter>.  It happens that way <laughter>.	24
I was a staff officer in Vietnam, in sixty-nine and seventy --	24
{C but } I've always liked baseball.	24
I think that they have a system where, {F uh, } [ they, + the  government ] deals [ with  the, + with, ] -	24
# {F Uh } [ {D well, } + {D well } ] DOW JONES for example [ have the, + cause the ] # -- -- {F uh, } news wire -	24
{D Well, } {F um, } I, {F uh, } exercise regularly.	24
{D Well, } the sport I like best probably is basketball.	24
We went to the beach --	24
Yeah,	36
I just live down here now.	24
I know	21
Uh-huh.	15
# Really. #	15
{C so } we can kind of put aside some money that actually is better for us not to see -- -- # versus # when it's on the paycheck	24
Uh-huh.	15
I think that maybe  [ the, +  the ] automation people that are -- --  (( very ))  discrete. Or not  discrete, electronic devices.	9
[ I can't, + I can't ] watch it on T V,	24
When we were in Colorado, they had, {F um, } a different type of H M O there that I really liked a lot.	24
I like to see the people going to Texas just play,  the ones that are in class.	24
is it on, {F uh, } capital crimes that they have to be unanimous	7
that,  -	26
Yes	36
-- [ it takes, + {F uh, } it takes ] almost six months to get, {F uh, } handgun permit, #  in this state. #	24
{F Uh, } <<pause>> I can't remember the last time I saw it.	24
{D So, } -	26
those files are going to back up on somebody's desk, just  (( some of )) that typical bureaucratic work.	9
She's three.	24
at the office I generally catch the WALL STREET JOURNAL at lunchtime.	24
I think they just want to  stay mediocre  and draw their two million fans out there and then be happy with it  and not have to pay the bucks to get a contender in here.	9
[ I, + I ]  ((   )) , # -	26
# Wow. #	21
Okay.	29
it was always just talking to the computer.	24
Bye.	38
{C and, } {F uh, } -	26
I live on [ one of tho-, + that ] little ten mile spot.	24
{C and, } {D you know, }    *[[slash error]] This  isn't, {D you know, } [ prob-, +  most likely ] not [ to, +  going to ] be used against you,	26
The cover-ups and, -	9
{C but, } {F uh, } as you know P C -s change quite rapidly	24
we got three eighty-sixes and an eighty-four <laughter>.	24
Uh-huh.	15
it's easy to believe that they were probably more forced into a pact than, {F uh, } a volunteer or willingness to join.	9
{C but } just when I got out I feel like I should have spent more time in the library,	24
I always thought it would be, -	24
{C and then } I pour about a half a cup of cornstarch in it	24
{C and } we do,	24
Yeah	15
Uh-huh.	15
I just got married less than two years ago,	24
I know someone that did that,	24
{C But } [ it, + it ] seems [ like, +  like, ] {F uh, } it's sort of [ [ a, + {F uh, } a sp-, ] + an unending spiral, ]	9
Okay.	29
{C because } [  my brother, +  my brother ] is impossible, when, {F um, } he does football leagues  and baseball leagues and all kinds of stuff,	24
then there's always a gardening part of the newspaper -- -- or communications, as well as, I bet there's a talk show up there right now that [ you, + ] if you turn the dial around -- -- you'll, -	24
[ they, + {D you know, } they, ] -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{D See, } {C and } that's, -	26
No,	33
No,	13
{D So, } -	26
and I think it's frightening to them to see the  roles switching.	9
Yeah,	38
{C and } they lasted from, {D you know, } [ about +  when you harvest them about ] a month from now or so, or six weeks, from now, [ until, + until ] {D like } October,	24
[ I, +  I ] became a technical writer.	24
We're getting company tonight,	24
# It, # -	26
Is it choice or just business	7
we want to see that one.	24
{C And } it'll work out perfect.	24
Yeah,	4
It's been nice talking with you.	38
{C because } you can ruin your good clothes getting so  hot in them [ if you + ] -- -- especially if it's something that has to be dry cleaned, which I don't have any of.	9
Yeah.	36
there's been a lot of reports since then.	24
Oh.	15
Refresh my memory.	18
[ You  + ((   ))  you ]  would not be pulling it out of your account all of the time -- -- just by yourself.	22
-- {C but } the food is good,	24
Uh-huh.	15
<Laughter> {C But, } -	26
I haven't gotten really involved in anything, {F uh, } extensive in car repairs in, {F oh, } {F oh, } probably a year or so.	24
yeah,	26
They do?	12
Yeah.	15
{C So } I've got a couple of those started.	24
Totally.  {F Uh, }	36
<Laughter> {F Oh, } I like that too.	24
if I had more time, I'd probably do it and sell the stuff	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } there's two schools of  thought on that.	24
I've heard that,	24
# I know.	24
All righty.	38
although they don't actually  [ e-, +  execute ] it themselves, it's really the government that  ((   )) . -	9
{D you know, } [ in, + in ] the, [ in, + ] {D you know, } I hope that what's happening is exactly the way it appears.	9
{C and } I personally feel [ if, + if ] they have [ draf-, + the draft, ] that they should draft women as quickly as they do the men.	24
<Throat_clearing>.	20
# {C But } when I find, # -	24
{C and  then } # at work # -- -- I have no time to read the news.	24
{E I mean } you could hardly tell the women from the men except for the lengths of the pants.    *[[need slash]] {C And } one was a skirt and one was a pant.   *[[sd]]	24
[ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C but } ] [ I, + I ] do like having them there.	24
No,	33
{C and so. } -	26
I guess, -	26
{C And } I think a lot of their friends feel the same way too.	24
{C And, } {D yeah, }  you have to stay up on stuff,	9
they do.	36
I've -- -- been, {F uh, } -	26
I agree.	36
it seems funny you how within the last  couple of years cars have gotten bigger again, {D you know, }	9
that's been about ten years ago, right?	7
[ espec-, + ] this particular one,  I think, was in Maine and New Hampshire,  [ where + ] [ out in the, +  just kind of out   in these ] little towns  they'd be in,	24
Ithaca.	30
# Yeah, #	15
Yes.	15
Okay.	26
You don't necessarily have to be doing anything, {D you know, } that costs money [ or, + or, ] {D you know, } that requires you to go a great distance or anything like that.	9
{D see } I was picked for another murder trial before --	24
{C but } now I really, -	26
{D So. } I know, my father had  a P C,	24
You-, -	26
{F Oh, } no <laughter>.	21
we don't.	24
That's what the financing rules and the, {F uh, } the mailing rules and the size of the office staff and all that stuff. -	9
Yeah.	4
it's almost like being selected for jury duty <laughter>.	9
and, and the looking, you know, -	26
{D well, } if you're ready, then {F uh, } -	8
{C and now, } [ I think + I think ] people are trying to get out of that.	9
Uh-huh.	15
That's the only thing they broadcast	24
Uh-huh.	15
Right <laughter>.	15
-- {C and } I don't drive that much.	24
<<Very faint>> Uh-huh.	15
do you know my grandparents live in Durant?	7
[ I am, + I am ] right outside Baltimore.	3
that's where practically everybody I talked to is from.	38
Yeah,	15
Now, I can appreciate that, especially after what happened in Vietnam.	24
my husband does	24
it is.	36
{F Uh, } Robert [ what do you, {F uh, } think, + what substances do you think ] are the most, {F uh, } likely causes of air pollution?	39
[ There's, + {F uh, } there's ] a girl I work with, our secretary, as a matter of fact,	24
Sure, come on out, {D you know, }	25
{C and }  they will roll around on the ground and play with the dogs	24
{C And, }  {F uh, } U N L V wasn't  used to that.	24
Do you pay too much?	7
{C so } that's a half an hour roughly the same with newspaper.	24
{C and } <children>, I thought, {D well, } I'm just not anxious to have worry about the weather.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } yeah.	36
Yeah,	4
Yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C and then } I'll show them we can play golf in the middle of winter when we can't do it back home.	24
he doesn't like to roll over.	24
I only know of one woman who's decided to go  that quote, unquote, traditional route.	24
{C But } they will accept you later in life also.	24
My sister was telling me [ she met a gi-, + she's  ] going to the University of Pennsylvania [ in, + in  ] Philadelphia,	24
{E I mean } [ ha-, + had ] he been around children,	7
Ready to talk?	7
{E I mean, } it grows like a weed.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Exactly.	36
{C But, }  {F uh } -	26
Yeah.	15
It's pink.	24
Okay,	29
Oh.	15
I think so, too.	36
{C and, }  {F uh } -- -- of course the soil right under the slab retains it's moisture a lot  longer --	24
I usually vote.	24
Which is, {D you know, } -	26
Our state taxes are somewhat based on the federal.	24
{D See, } I even know his name because  he's on the news a lot,	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	15
{D You know, } it seems like  everybody's always so busy with everything that they're doing that there's no time for this and that and the other,	9
# {D Well } it's getting # where [ you can't hardly afford, +  if you're going to give your kids any kind of education and stuff you can't hardly afford  ] to have over two.	9
yeah.	4
{D Well, } {D you know, } on Friday  nights especially, we like to watch TWENTY TWENTY.	24
[ {C and } + {C and } ]  we threatened to make the other two {F uh } make us dinner one time {F Uh } Just to even it out since  we seemed to be unfairly doing all the cooking {C and } they were doing all the enjoying	24
{C And so, } I know  they didn't pick up these curse words from me.	24
Uh-huh,	15
Uh-huh,	15
Isn't that funny the way we put,  {D you know, } {F um, } human characteristics on an animal like # that	8
It's kind of like [ do it, + do it ] in the similar vein [ similar, + like, ] {F uh, } V C R or television repair.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } now I feel lost.	24
Is Contact a, #  ((   ))  substance? #	7
Yeah,	4
It's an opportunity to get out and  relieve some of the pressure that you feel  day to day	9
I think that, {F um, } in general the whole immigration policy isn't quite as open as it should be.	9
[ it, + it. ] -	26
{C but } <breathing> <noise> it's amazing how many cans you go through. # And how fast they accumulate. #	9
<laughter>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } [ you get, + you can get  ] a CAT CAM system that can take any design you want	24
[ [ [ {C An-, } + {C and so, } ] +  {F uh, } {F uh, } {C and, } ] + {C and } ]  the reason I'm doing this whole thing is because Rick, whose another government employee  wanted [ a spe-, + segments ] of my speech, [ that -- + -- that ] were done a year ago	24
Does she have a, -	7
Uh-huh.	15
I like the Moody Blues.	24
Wow,	21
{C but } other times <clicking> it. -	26
{C and } it went over ten minutes.	24
{C and } now they're doing that	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
{D well, } I think that, {F um,  } -	9
It is inside	11
and that, -	26
Oh.	15
{F Oh, } really.	12
That's what I did with mine, for a long time, put it on the handlebars so I can hang them up.	24
{C and } you don't get  good reception without cable	24
# Sunday. #	2
I don't know that it was her in particular -- -- but just the character.	24
Uh-huh.	15
I don't even know how to knit	24
I've had dogs through the years.	24
{C So } it is like double strenuous.	24
{C And } we went to this one,	24
Yeah.	4
That's why it really surprises me, {D you  know, } that he hasn't come back, because, <breathing> like I said, he's never gone away like this before,	24
{F Um. }	26
{C and } that was really fun.	24
{C And } there was, -	26
I don't know.	13
I would be interested to find out [ how many people, + {E or } how much, {F uh, } people ] use credit this year.  Say in nineteen ninety-two as opposed to nineteen ninety-one, even nineteen ninety.	24
Good,	21
Bye-bye.	38
{C but } [ when, + ] it helped that she got to still be in a house and still have some of her own stuff.	24
There you go.	21
Yeah.	30
[ he's, + he's ] slowly getting me to, {F um, } not feel isolated if we move [ t-, + to ] where there's more land.	24
I can't remember what it's even called now,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } I think that's # what companies are doing,  {F uh, } more and  more because there are products that are out there.	9
-- {C so } that's not hard,	24
{C and } they don't pay very much	24
I, -	26
Yeah.	15
if he has them out, cleaning them, {D you know, }  she can be there	24
{D Well, } [ [ it, + it, ] + it ] usually takes me about probably [ two, + two ] or three to get it there	24
{C but } we put him in a private school in Richardson,	24
It's the sad life I think today.	9
-- {C and } we broke the, I guess it's the freezing component --	24
Right. #	36
{F Oh } that's nice	21
Uh-huh.	15
{C And, } {F uh, } -	26
{C But } it was only like a part-time basis.	24
{E I mean } [ it was, + it,  ] -	26
Uh-huh.	15
No,	33
-- {F uh, } [ I'm more, +   I guess I'm more ] into science and  science fiction	24
Sure.	21
[ we have, + we have ] a lot of people who work on the line.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I was scared to drive that big van.	24
not yet,	24
Yeah.	15
# Yeah. #	15
{F Oh, } I bet that was frustrating, wasn't it?	7
Okay.	38
Yeah.	4
{C And } I'm a trumpet player.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
Yeah <laughter>.	15
-- {C so } it's an investment,	9
Yeah.	15
[ {C and, } +  {C and } ]  they're the same silly things,	9
{C and } we. -	26
{C and } [ [ it's, +  it's, ] +   it's, ] {F uh, } <laughter> interesting to watch some of the things that she does	24
How about you?	31
that's true.	36
{C And } [ you, + {F uh, } have you ]  eaten yet or whatever.	7
Me too.	24
<Throat_clearing>.	20
the fact [ that, +  that ] [ it's, +  it's ] a better established and that [ the, +  the ]  city [ [ is, +  is, ] +  is ] more, of a ... -	26
Yeah,	36
{F Oh, } same here.	38
[ if, + if ] especially violent <TV> crime, where serial type killer or maybe a child has been deliberately killed. -	24
that's true,	9
They need to # restrain #  -- -- about what they do.	9
{F Um. }	26
{C so. } You've been out to  Buffalo Gap fishing.	8
{C And } there was no, # real [ up,  + upward ]  movement.	24
Uh-huh.	15
The yellow.	30
Okay,	15
<Noise> <<paper unraveling>>.	20
Yeah,	36
you're not, you don't have to, -	24
There's something about, {F um, } the industry in the state, That, {F um, } -	9
yes.	36
{F Uh, } no,	33
in the Firewheel Estates there, whatever.	8
{F Uh, } [ I think, + I think ] [ there really is a, + there's a ] lot they need to learn, {D you know, } when you get there.	9
[ It, + {C and } it ] doesn't seem to get much better for the exempts either, unless you're twenty-eight or above.	9
Give me some wonderful advice Catherine.	18
They're both national level -- -- swimmers,	24
{C But } I think you you really hit the nail on the head.	9
{C so } [ it's not, + it's not ]  what you think it is.	9
{C But, } {F uh, } -	26
have your normal smarts about you, then you really don't have to worry,	24
{C And } my wife, she likes Italian and stuff,	24
[ # I,  + come to think of it, I  ] don't think I went to the movies one time.	24
[ the, + {F uh, } the ] [ first, {F uh, } ten years, + {D see } first ten ] or twelve years, I stayed home.	24
{C So } it is an hour.	24
-- {C and } sooner or later [ there's going to, + there's going to ] be a turn around.	9
Yeah, {F huh. }	15
That's [ pretty + <tapping> pretty ] sad	21
We had open forum	24
Bye,	38
# Yeah. #	15
-- just the burning of the che-, -	9
Just goes on and on.	9
What -- -- do you feed them?	39
It is called H G H -- -- or something like K G H or, -	24
{C But, } on any given night there's not seventy -- -- {D you know, }	24
Yeah,	15
At least.	30
{C and } I don't know why anybody would want to get under that scrutiny anymore.	24
[ They need to, +  samples need to ]  stretch out and gun cases and things like  that	24
I think [ that, + that ]  [ if it's, + if it's ] not a split decision, go with the highest number	9
Yeah,	36
I  haven't,	24
Boy, I'm improving. <Laughter>. Uh-huh	2
and the, uh, home was palatial.	24
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } yeah,	15
{C and } being # on a, {D you know, } <clicking> rigid schedule [ wouldn't, + ] there wouldn't be anyway to do that at all.	24
{C And } <throat_clearing> it's an absolutely beautiful automobile -- -- and well appointed and so forth,	24
[  I, + I ] see the packages on it, {F uh, } that are available	24
{C And so, } {F uh, }  after he took that merit badge, he did all  the shopping and [ preparing, +  getting ready ] for it.	24
Oh.	15
{C and, }  {F uh, }  I felt like just miserable all weekend	24
<Children_talking>.	20
Do you want to start?	7
Yeah,	36
{C and } all they did was just, {F uh, } make a beep noise	24
Yep.	15
{C and } therefore I enjoyed following those particular players.	24
and or, to me, yeah, both of them. -	26
[ It just, + it just ]  seems like a lot of trouble for something at home.	9
[ I have a brother, +  I have a brother ] that's a pilot, also, with American.	24
in the summertime they have musicals there	24
Do you know anyone that, {F uh, } [ is, + is ] in a nursing home or has ever been in one?	7
{D you know, } each attorney can use that as much as they like	24
{C So, } I don't know.	19
{C And then } I have been in Human Resources for the last two years	24
# Okay, #	29
He didn't feel like he had any say.	24
uh-huh.	15
{C and }  {E I mean } all guys, I think, like to barbecue.	9
FIELD OF DREAMS.	24
Oh.	15
{F Um, } <breathing> I think their biggest problem is just, {D you know, } obtaining food to live,	9
<Sigh> {D You know, } [ I, + I ] don't think so  yet.	5
{D Well, } that's right.	36
{C But } [ it's, + it's ] fun to, -	9
{C and } eventually we ended up replacing all the pipes from the sink clear back to the main drain. # Which meant you # needed to take the wall out and start all over.	24
Uh-huh.	36
Uh-huh.	15
right.	15
Yeah,	15
what about	39
{F Oh, } <laughter> {D boy, } you have a lot of kids.	9
{F Um. }	15
It's a fairly new lake in Texas.	24
[ That's, + that's ] unbelievable for that size of car.	9
{D you know } when you graduate from college they'll send you all those -- -- credit card applications -- -- {D you know, }	24
{C So, }  do you have a big family?	7
we have some people who say, {D well, } this isn't going to affect me, this air pollution,	24
nowadays, with the way the income tax, I think housing is strictly to itemize.	9
Yeah.	36
Each time I change jurisdictions or whatever.	24
# [ That, + # that's ] a serious truck.	9
it's in east, -	24
that's, -	26
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
{C and } I really liked it,	24
We do not have cable.	24
Yeah,	4
{E I mean } it's not very many miles from our house at all.	24
I think, {D you know, } one of the things [ [ that, + that, ] + that ] needs to happen is, {F uh, } [ to, + to ] stop the impulse buyer from, {F uh, } buying it quickly [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } maybe putting a week's waiting period or something on it.	9
Yes.	36
{C but } {E I mean } they do.	24
Right,	15
that's true,	9
how about when they were younger,	31
Uh-huh.	15
let's see,	17
{C and } they cook meals	24
{C and, } {F uh, } I lived in Massachusetts for a while	24
{C and } the man who was doing the separating, when he was done emptying the tub, he took a little electronic reader device off of his belt	24
{C but } [ I just, +  {F uh, }  I'm ] consulting right now,	24
Yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
{E I mean } he certainly didn't, -	24
{F Um. }	15
{F Huh. } {D Well } are you going to paint the outside of your house too?	7
Yeah.	15
{D Anyway } the ba-, -	26
{C And, } {F uh, } {D well, } I am reading [ historical, {F uh, } not a novel, but + historical book ] now about [ the, + ] {F uh, } Russia [ [ before, {F uh, } the czar, + not before the czar, ] + ] during the czar's time and what it was like and everything.	24
{C but. } -	26
Oh, okay.	15
{C But } that's unusual.	21
I tried to remember as I took stuff off where it  went,	24
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } yeah,	36
yeah	36
it was just a rumor that that would  happen this time.	9
Pennsylvania.	29
[ {C And, } + {C and, } ] {D like, } the new ones are pretty cool [ because, + because ] they got {D like, } {F uh, } {D like } [ special, + {D like } especially ] things, that, {D like, } fuck with your mind.	24
sure.	15
{C And } only when the infant screams, are they going to go there,	9
{F Oh, } [ is, +  is ]  that what you usually use in the house, is latex?	7
Some of the video rentals can be expensive	24
{C And, }  -	26
I usually keep up with T V.	24
{C and } -- -- {F uh, } Disneyworld is the one for a week next year --	24
I think that is the most important thing <laughter>.	9
{E I mean } I do want my pilot to be sober <laughter>.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } the smell, -	24
[ I, + I ] always have geraniums	24
the coaches watch him all year long.	24
Yeah.	15
yeah,	15
Groceries for a week.	9
sure.	15
{C So } we get two channels down here.	24
the other topics.	24
{F Oh, } wow,	21
Yeah.	4
{C And so } this is my seventh call.	24
{C and } there's no reason for it, {D you know. }   *[[ Should end in a slash, not continue over to B.14, which is a response to A.13. ]] Fix or repair daily --   *[[ Should be an indep slash unit--is an answer to A.13 and not related to B.12 utt2 ]] -- or find them [ re-, +  road ] dead.	24
{C and } those cases are, {F uh, } lesser degrees of magnitude.   {D You know, }	9
I'm a nurse	24
[ We bought, + when we first married, we bought ]  one on our T V	24
Something like that.	24
Stagnant <laughter>.	36
{C but, }  {D you know }  -- -- I'd get upset about it sometimes,	24
I've only been in it for a year,	24
-- {C and } I know that the tax there is extremely high, much higher than we pay here,	24
[ my, + my ]  favorite movie of all time has been, {F uh, } {F uh, } THE MISSION.	24
-- {C but } they would take a credit card.	24
{C And } I'm willing to sacrifice, I guess.	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C and } we hooked it back up	24
{C so, } -	26
<child>.  It's top speed is something like eighty miles an hour.	24
MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.	30
{D Well, } do you think it's, should be illegal for an employer to do this	7
They have probably, {F ooh, } I'd say [ fifteen different, +  fifteen to twenty different ] aerobics classes each session that are running,	24
Yeah,	4
{F Uh, } what about you?	31
You just don't have, -	26
{F Oh, } yeah,	36
{F Um, } are you working right now?	7
It got over so fast,	9
{C and } {D so } now that I do have one, I just don't automatically turn it on -- -- unless there's something I'm particularly listening to.	24
Yeah	15
{F Uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, }  {D well, } not that much <laughter>.	24
{C So } I'm having to, {F uh, } try to figure out a way to be able to do that.	24
{D Well, } let me tell you, they do not  come back very well at all.	9
{C and } they have one of [ the clerks up there, + {E no, } the bag boys out there, ]  {F um, } that will take the [ papers, + newspaper ] out of your car,	24
I'm glad you put it that way.	24
{D Well, } {C and } I think a lot of companies are realizing this and  offering more opportunities as far as {D like } job sharing or, {D you know, } even having a day care on site and that kind of stuff,	9
-- that's exactly, -	9
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } that's neat.	21
We all aren't Martha Stewart  and have our coordinated glasses and  tablecloths [ and, + and ] time to, {D you know, }  [ sh-, + t-, ] -	24
{C And } when she <laughter> complains about the food -- -- then they kind of get angry with her.	24
Right	15
{C So } it's a, -	26
# # minor league, # baseball, I think <laughter>  is a lot more fun than, # major # league baseball.	24
That sounds, -	26
# Got your routine down. #	2
{D Like } our principal says, I want every child to be on task all the time.	24
-- {C so } [ if + ] it's, {F uh, } nice to get  out and find a good restaurant like that,	9
Yep,	36
{C But } [ [ that, + that, ] + I guess you could consider that  ] organized.	9
# {F Oh, } I see,	29
{C But, } I think they're doing better.	9
{C but, } -	26
<Laughter> Which one?	39
{C But, }  then, what do I know, <laughter> --	16
it was sort of sandy # [ and + # -- -- and ] not, {F uh, } a very good finish.	24
Yeah <laughter>.	15
-- right,	36
the thing that probably helps me most doing that is really, {D you know, } <laughter> {F uh, } not so much discipline,	24
Yes.	4
{C but } it's, of course, still really important.	9
yeah,	36
I think it takes a, -	9
{C so. }  Does T I have a pretty good retirement package, do you think?	7
That's interesting,	21
Yeah.	4
you could, always make them the slave of the people they committed the crime against.	9
Yeah.	15
# words, it, # -	24
{C So } we have a pretty good size garden <laughter>.	24
It was funny, even the sweets did.	24
Yeah.	15
no kidding.	21
{C so } there were a lot of bottles to be returned	24
we have two freezers,	24
Which isn't, {D you know, }  pretty much what we [ loo-, + look ] for anyway.	9
Right.	15
it's the, -	26
<Laughter> {C And } that she has kittens that look like her.	24
{F Um, } when he gets outside, [ does, in, + does ] he run away and then eventually come back?	7
Yeah,	15
Yeah,	15
{C so } we don't have, {D you know, } six thousand plastic milk jugs, # a month, {D you know. } #	24
flex time is great.	9
{C or } do you think that we are to the degree that we  are causing <<pause>>. -	7
Like HIGHWAY TO HEAVEN?	8
(( where you are ))    *[[slash error; one utt with 4]]	7
Yeah.	15
I think that sounds fascinating.	9
{C and } [ they, + {F uh, } they, ] I think, extend beyond the normal, {F uh, } appeal process.   {F Uh, } {D you know, } and just drag [ these, + this ] guy, {F uh, } [ his, + his, ] {F uh, } ultimate, {F uh, } demise out for ten or fifteen years.	9
Well <laughter>, actually right now I'm a full time college student	24
It's just a train ride.	24
{C and so } I don't use drugs any more.	24
{C and so, } {F uh, } -	26
{C but, } {F uh, } I like the Dodge  products	24
{C So, } {E I mean } [ that's, + that's ] a form of budgeting I would think <<pause>>.	9
# {C So, }  # {F uh } <noise>  -- -- # [ they're, # + they're ] looking forward to it.	24
-- yeah.	15
Such a deal.	21
{C but, } {F um, } it was kind of hard for me to think, here's someone as wealthy as he is,	24
{C and } you get sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides.	9
Sometimes -- -- [ we'll have, + {F uh, } we'll have ]  a bunch of people over and cook deer.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } [ it, +  it ] gets bad.	9
{C and } I think mothers, {F um, } are doing a really good job in raising their daughters to say, hey, you don't have to stay with nursing,	24
not quite because I'm not a whole family.	24
# Huh. #	15
It's just a matter of finding, a good home.	9
Uh-huh.	15
# I work # at Channel Six.	24
{C and } it seems to work pretty well so far.	24
Yeah.	15
they, -	26
Hey,	13
You hit a little ball,	9
I tell you what,	17
# It seems like ((   )) , # -	9
right.	15
Yeah.	15
your whole family can enjoy those hobbies.	22
{C and } he just got a new job.	24
it's northwest.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	36
{F Oh, } it did?	12
[ It, + {C and } it's  ] funny because the one I have, every single month without fail she has babies.	24
{D Well, } I find myself watching just a whole lot of whatever is geared for children.  Because,    *[[two utts]] with two kids -	24
{C And, } {F um, } I really love that,	24
Oh.	15
# [ {C And, } + # {C and } ] it was at least two months after I got up here.	24
yeah,	15
{F Uh, } here it is.	24
Yes.	15
{E I mean } it was kind of like, {D okay, }  we'll do this during this point and time	9
He moved,	24
Where do you play golf in this area?	39
It would run into a lot of money.	24
# You bet. #	11
{C and } that's another part of the problem.	24
[ It, + it's ] kind of pull and tug,	24
I've probably seen it, though,	24
Right,	15
Right <laughter>.	11
they're goin-, -	26
If someone ever, -	26
[ That, + {F oh, } that's  ] horrible, <laughter>	9
# {C and } [ some, +  # some ]  of them did quit the company.	24
{C So } it wasn't enough to total it,	24
{F Uh, }  we had a school that had classes probably about the same size you're talking, twenty-seven, thirty kids [ to sc-, + to a # class. # ]	24
Yeah,	36
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } you're from North Carolina.	24
{F Uh, } the HOUSEKEEPING magazines I do like because [ they, + like you say, they  ] have nice, {F uh, } recipes in them and ideas, but, {F uh, } lately they've just been piling up on me,	24
{C So } they're not too much into beef.	24
-- {C and } we'd have a little contest finding the tiniest shell, and finding the biggest shell.	24
Said, {D you know, } -	26
-- {C and } we had a two bedroom mobile home there,	24
the comics are better in this newspaper.	9
{C But } on the other  hand, we just love watching the kids play and getting to know the other  parents	24
People are individuals	9
I think everybody should contribute to the  education of their children even if they had to raise the sales tax by one  percent then everybody going through the state would be supporting our education system.	9
Uh-huh.	15
They just wait for you to show up after they've picked out which one they want.	24
{F Oh, } yeah,	15
-- I think it was too extreme.	9
They propagate pretty well, those little fish.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	36
{E I mean, } that's --	26
No,	36
{C But } then again, so many times you get one or two holdouts,	9
<Sigh>.	20
-- {C and, } {F uh, } -	26
# {D Well, } {D you # know } <laughter>?	23
{C And } I was going to wait until, {F um, } about  my sixth month and then start that.	24
I'm sorry for these beeps,	41
<Lipsmack> {D Well, } I've  [ been +  kind of  <breathing>, been ] intrigued with the Rangers, {F uh, } more so with, {F uh, } {F uh, }  their management than anything else.	24
{C  So } <laughter>. -	26
My fiance   received a bill from [ a, + a  ] Lord and Taylor company,	24
{C So, }  that's. -	26
You don't have to go out and borrow it  somewhere and do that.	22
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } we had a vice principal shot at here -- -- last year [ on the, + {D you know, } on the ] school grounds after school.	24
I'm hoping that won't be, cou-, -	26
Did Dana sign you up for this?	7
Uh-huh.	15
All right.	15
{C And } our local H E B stores here, -	24
{F Uh, } for a while they built [ a, +  a ] run for him out to the side of the house, {D you know. }	24
I live in, {F uh, } Richardson, # Texas, #	24
Where they couldn't do that.	22
{C And so, } if I go back to work on a part time basis, I am hoping I can leave my daughter with her. Because, her daughter again will be a couple of months, <baby> my daughter will be about six months older than hers.	24
# I, {F uh, } -	26
yes.	36
Catching tree bass,	22
{F Um. }	26
{C And then } the ones in my apartment, half of which don't look real healthy,	24
you have to have people who believe in your cause.	9
What are they doing up there?	39
{D You know, } {E I mean, } if I don't hear him playing, {E I mean, } [ I, + I ] get up and come out and look out the window real often, {D you know, }	24
I have no, {F uh, }  dependents or anything,	24
like you said, always takes <children_talking> way longer than anyone, <lipsmack> {F um, } <swallowing> is able to guess, because I know my husband [ he, + he ] painted, when he, -	9
[ [ I, + I, ] + I ] hear, -	26
Okay <laughter>.	29
Fortunately, she only had to stay <noise> <<faint in background>> a few weeks	24
write a couple of resumes,   *[[listen to this and the previous two utts--same or separate?]]	24
{D Well, } I try to do it at night before I go to bed.	24
Uh-huh <laughter>	15
Uh-huh.	15
Uh, the one, the most valueless girl doesn't,	5
[ they're, + they're ] pretty good.	9
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
{C But }  just compared to how spoiled we are, we would be in our own minds,	24
Are you a golfer?	7
Okay.	13
{D Well, } {F uh, } normally I like  [ to, +  to ] go out fishing in a boat, [ and, + ] {F uh, } rather than {D like } bank fishing, [ and + ] just {D like }  to try and catch anything that's swimming, because I've had such problems  with trying to catch any type of fish, that, {F uh, } I just really enjoy  doing the boat type fishing.	24
{D Well, } [ we've got, + in Texas, we have  ] a female governor.	24
{E I mean, } that's so funny.   {E I mean, }	9
<Laughter>.  Yeah.	15
Us, too.	24
{C and } I said if I ever had a son, he would not play football.	24
{C and } the street doesn't go anywhere.	24
you hear this as an excuse,	9
Yeah.	15
Like I said, I don't remember the article that well.	24
{C So } [ she, + she ] was able to zero in.	8
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
{C and } I've gained fifteen pounds.	24
No,	36
Yeah.	4
[ the, + the ] big issue [ was, + ] [ [ is, + is, ] + ] when we moved here a few years ago, is whether it was okay for you, to, {F uh, } drink beer while you were driving your pickup truck. And throw it out at the in {F uh, }	24
I think he's dead now, <laughter>	24
{C and then } we started <laughter> borrowing from one envelope to put it in the other envelope	24
{C and } finally my [ wife, + wife, ] bless her heart, got rid of it,  because I didn't really like  it.	24
do you have two children?	7
{F Oh, } {D well, } then it won't be too bad.	21
Yeah,	15
I tell you that's sad too because there one time Ford was the best, that was made.	9
He had on a pair, of slacks,	24
I don't have kids	24
Yes,	4
what do you do when you're putting?	39
{C and } she and her sister had side by side duplexes, one bedroom duplex.	24
Kind of gives them the, {D you know, } -	9
{C but } I certainly work near a city.	24
{C But } they did give him a new computer at work,	24
{F Uh, } to be honest, I didn't pay that much attention, {F uh, } to the details of it.  {F Uh, }	24
{C But, }  {F uh, } I, -	26
{C and } she loved doing that.	24
# {D Well, } {C because } my, # -	26
{C And } he saw  ((   )) . -	24
{F Oh } Purdue,	30
I drive a Honda Prelude.	24
# Yes.	15
Talk to my daughter.	24
Yeah,	4
Yeah,	15
{C But, } then it's experience.	24
<Laughter>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
{F Um, } {C but } in the vegetable garden we grow, {F um, } usually,  what -	24
-- {D so. } -	26
yeah,	26
Uh-huh.	4
[ we, + we're ] together probably for, {F um, } {F uh, } very close for about six months before we got married.	24
{F Uh, }	26
No,	36
just the volume makes a big difference,	9
they won't let you on death row,	24
{D You know, } they're in classes together, even when they're outside of the engineering department.	24
-- {C and } I worked in a very rural  school district	24
{C and so } I, {F uh, }  was a teacher	24
# What do you do with it,	2
{D Well, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ]  come from kind of a biased opinion because I'm [ a, + a ] therapist and a drug and alcohol counselor.	3
{C and then } I like, {F um, } -	26
{D Well, } what kid isn't <laughter>, # these # days,	16
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } yeah,	4
{C and } I took them all --	24
{D Now, } do you think since they started  with electronic ignition that it improves the way the car runs?	7
<Laughter>.	20
{C but } [ they, + they ] golf in the high sixties low seventies	24
Yeah.	36
<Breathing> <laughter>.	20
{C And, } {F uh, } I just close it  out, I guess, because [ I don't, +  I don't ] remember waking up in several  years at night when I'd hear a fire truck go by, {D you know. }	24
[ What, + what ] do you envision for  the next twenty years as far as women in American society?	39
Uh-huh.	15
[ I've been to a couple, +  I've been to a few games ] before.	24
{F Oh, } he does?	12
{D You know } when he is in the house, he will come up and he'll jump on his lap,	24
[ I'm real dis-, + I'm kind of disgusted ] this year because I don't see many women into the political scene	24
I hate sequels too.	24
# <Laughter> # [ I went, + <Cough> I turned ] mine in about twelve hours early at noon.	24
{C and } it's the western half of an island,	24
[ I can't, + I don't ]  know the name of it,	24
Sure.	15
{C But, } {F uh, } to the best of my ability, I'd like to do it until it gets impossible <inhaling>.	24
# Man, I'm, # -	26
Uh-huh.	15
-- because she doesn't even ask me.	24
{C because, } {F uh, } two years ago we were the day after  Christmas able to go out in shorts and  play tennis in the nice sunny [ weat-, + weather, ]	24
{C and }  we were driving back	24
We used to have a Honda Accord	24
Yeah,	26
I wouldn't even mind being <laughter> not so much being first but just, {F uh, } get out there [ and, +  and ] just explore.	24
{F Oh, } I think [ that's a, + that's a ] good idea.	9
Yeah.	15
{C and then } [ [ [ you, + {D you know, } you had, ] + I think you had to pick it, ] + [ [ by, + by, ] + by ] the end of the second you had to pick ] some sort of major,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but, } then that kind of thinking is also tempered with [ the, + the ] knowledge, or at least [ the, + the ] rumor,  {A I'm not really sure if it's true or not, } that, {F uh, } we're not spending as much per, let's say, afflicted person on cancer.	24
Most of that's done with rifles and such.   {F Uh, } though there's, {D you know, } probably I'm sure some sector that does it with handguns.	24
You don't.	22
That's all.	24
{D Well } I haven't had too much of a chance to watch T V lately.	24
{F oh, } just # about f-, -	24
[ It, + it's ] one of those necessities  of life that we all have to,  (( {D you know } )) , pay taxes  [ but, + ] although it is  kind of a pain sometimes though.	9
we feed them,	9
That's <<faint>>, -	26
{D You know, } [ if I, + {F uh } -- -- if I ] ever had to put her there, I think, {F uh, } it would be probably when I just could not handle it any more, {D you know, } if [ I -- + -- she ] got to the point where she was totally bedridden, [ and, + and ] {E I mean, } I just didn't have the skills or the strength to lift her or whatever it needed,	24
Uh-huh <<pause>>.	15
they automatically took it [ out of # my # -- + -- out of my ] payroll.	24
{D here, } it's your turn, {D you know. }	25
Yeah.	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } I'm going, -	24
{C And } [ he has, + {A I would say, } he ]  adjusted very well	24
It was so funny.	24
{F Uh-, } {D well, } about nursing homes, [ and, + and ] older people.	24
it's really  out of the norm not to find something that isn't air conditioned.	9
{D well }   [ there's a, + there's a ] Holiday Spa down there [ on, + on ] K street, I think. Something like that.	24
{D you know, } it's like, wow <laughter>.	24
{D you know, } [ the, + the ] economic, -	26
# Uh-huh,	15
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
{D you know, } there is some definite, {F uh, } creative play, good social interaction, that kind of thing.	24
{C and } -- -- {D you know. } Right.	26
{D Well, } that's good.	21
{C but } it's, {D you know, } not immediately handy.	24
Yeah.	15
that's true,	21
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } my goodness.	21
{C So } -- -- I like it here.	24
I was a member, -	26
Right.	36
{C And } [ I, + I'd ] love to be the first one to step on a planet or some like, {D you know, } -	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } {D well } you have that with anything.	24
Uh-huh.	15
O-, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
[ Who, + how ] do you know that?	7
{C and } they've decorated real cute,  {D you know, } with a bunch of big old flowers -- -- and stuff.	24
# {D well, } the Giants are. # -	26
{F Uh, } watch out.	18
If I were you, I would get  the Greatest Hits album -- -- if he had one, because {D you know, } that would have  a mixture of all his, {D you know, } top songs on it.	18
Put a little bitty portable computer in there and a plasma display. And make it look like things like, {F uh, } {D you know, } attack simulators [ and + (( )) , and ] -- -- all sorts of little things you'd want to put your finger on the screen for.	24
{C And } [ it's, + it's ] interesting to notice when you go to different schools that some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual, {F uh, } -	24
I know they asked in the topic for  ideas on how to control crime <laughter>	24
<Noise> {C So, } {F uh, } I end up  sometimes reading the things that are written here all the way through, sometimes just a  few chapters because that's as far as they get <noise>.	24
{F Um. }	15
{D Well, } I took a lot of time in choosing this  site <clicking> -- -- because [ the, + the ] house has no  heating or air conditioning.	24
Yeah,	15
Right.	36
I know, if it's related,	21
Do you like to cook?	7
Yeah.	15
They didn't say what,	11
{C And, } {F oh, } {D you know, } I'll just short of have it on sometimes to just sort of pick up little tidbits from those.	24
# [ {D So, } + {D so } ] how, # -	26
{C and } we, I clip coupons.	24
-- {C and } since it wasn't shipped to her address, she could prove, {D you know, } that it wasn't her.	24
I think they all [ that-, + ] thought, {D well, } we have a live one <laughter>.  She'll subscribe <laughter>.	24
the (( )) says we should, {F uh, } go into the grief [ that, + that's ] there	24
Uh-huh,	15
I didn't know that, [ and, + ] {D you know, } until I came down here, and, kind of caught the fever.	24
Uh-huh.	15
right.	15
One moment please.	18
{C and, } {F uh, } we've been very pleased with it.	24
{C but } -- -- I go from classical all the way to, {F uh, }   jazz and country and -- -- {F uh, } soft pop, {F uh, }	24
That's true,	21
{E I mean, } if your husband did that to you, {C and } you did that to your husband, you would always be trying to please each other and  not yourself.	9
Yes,	36
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	36
okay <sniffing>.	15
{C But, } {F uh, } -	26
{C but } the rest of them are just parts <noise>.	24
{E I mean, } [ [ they, + they, ] + they ] really know how to isolate each of the different muscle groups, with those things	9
Yeah.	36
Of course, they drag a lot of drugs with them	24
Uh-huh <<very faintly>>.	15
Phone's always ringing	24
(( {C and } that was )) . # the details,	24
{C And } she still loves her to death.	24
I don't know that I could even think about quilting.	24
{C And } it's amazing,	24
<Laughter>  I really, can't think of any that would invade my privacy -- -- {D you know. }	24
I think it depends on, uh, you know, what the, ho-, the cloud cover -	9
{C and } [ it's, + it's ] kind of back up.	24
I kind of, -	26
Right,	36
It's already outdated.	2
-- {C and } you would get your book and just kind of cuddle up.	24
<Sniffing>.   *[[slash error]] # {D Well } # at least your talking to somebody who counts <laughter>.   *[[slash error and your should be you're]]	20
{C but } somebody who's need of carting, {F um, } aluminum beer cans around,	24
{D Well, } yeah.	15
I don't think this whole issue is settled as far as we're concerned.	9
Bye-bye.	38
Right.	15
{C So, } {D you know, } [ there, + they ] don't take up much storage space.	24
We missed it last year,	24
the worst part of it. -	9
Those are  ((   )) mind expanding books <laughter>.	9
[ I resp-, + I respect ] them and what their capabilities are.	24
mostly between the ages of two and ten.	24
{C But } like you say, if it hit you personally, closer at home you would [ feel, + feel  ] differently.	9
Yeah --	15
It was on his property.	24
[ I, + I ] like the adventure of it. And the idea [ that, + that ] we would survive long enough to get to that point and be able to do these fantastic things in space.	24
Uh-huh.	15
<Laughter>.	20
It probably won't start really showing up until ninety-four or so <laughter>.	9
[ I think that [ i-, + i-, ] + I think that's ] the way things work in Pennsylvania.	9
{C and } they're just, -	26
Just a nice comfortable ride.	9
{C and, } {F uh, } what we try and do [ to, +  to ] stick to our monthly budget is -- -- we pretty much have, {D you know, }  the house payment,	24
don't have to work at T I.	24
My mother lives in an apartment with my sister --	24
<Laughter> {F Oh, } yeah?	12
[ {C so } -- + -- {C and } ] I have that for automotive purposes.	24
Yeah,	26
because I have relatives who  live in Houston,	24
I really like that show.	24
It's kind of funny.	9
[ My, + {F uh, } my ] grandmother in California is, {F um, } -	24
yeah.	26
Sure.	15
{C so. } -	26
I thought that would be one of those that I would love to watch over and over.	24
{C and then } they think, -	26
<Laughter>.	20
I voted in the last national one.	11
{C and } they clean up their act,  but on a normal basis [ that they're, +  that they're ] dumping things, that they're not supposed to be dumping,	24
There's nothing, maybe a picture or two that belongs to that person	24
{F Uh, } [ I, + I ] subscribe to three newspapers.	24
I, {F uh, } -	9
I think they're all scared out [ after tha-, + <laughter> after, ] {F uh, } <swallowing> -	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	4
{F Uh, }  my family's pretty into it --	24
{D Like } where I work,  [ it's, +  it's ] pretty casual, {F uh,  }	24
What kind of car is it?	39
<Laughter>.	20
{C But } anyway, they're going to go on a cruise,	24
it sounds like it.	36
I've got to have somebody to compete  with,	24
I guess  (( we're ))  on the subject of finances,	9
I do -- -- # believe # it's a serious problem.	9
Well, I guess that's about five minutes.	38
Country would benefit,	9
No,	36
Huh-uh.	32
{F Oh, } uh-huh.	15
now I, I know eastern, -	24
Right.	15
That and ninety-eight point seven, I'm eclectic approach.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Um, } I'm north of Pittsburgh,	24
# {E I mean } # -- -	26
{C and } -- -- {F uh, } what's changing them, though, is the economic situation, # where # [ both -- -- team, + ] it has to be a team partnership now,	9
I'm only twenty-two	24
{C but, }  {F uh, } that's an opportunity to get out the games	24
they match the same amount.	24
{C and } we get an occasional, -	24
[ {C and } the, + {C and } [ the, + the ] ] procedure is utterly humiliating.	9
{C but, } {D you know, }  I'm just used to always growing up and hearing Cowboys, Cowboys, Cowboys,   and, {D you know, } Super Bowl,  and all this other stuff.	24
<Breathing>.	20
So -- -- I prefer that you just not go in and get them --	25
{C Because } that's like my daughter	24
# We fax # -- -- everything.	24
{C but } I don't watch any daytime T V at all.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } if you were in your house they were going to take you and beat   you.	24
Hey, what do you think,	16
no.	33
{D Well, } {F uh, } you like to eat them after you catch them?	7
It really is.	9
I don't know what that would be.	24
{C and } [ I, + I ] feel like I got a good college education	24
{F Oh, } wow.	21
{C and } [ I, + I ] think there ought to be more things added to it.	9
in a way you realize, -	19
[  It, + it's ] interesting [ that, + that ] most people don't realize how small the canal is.	24
{C But, } {D you know, } [ at some of the large schools, + I know that [ [ at, + at, ] + at ] University of Maryland ] where I am, {D you know, } in a P H D program, [ I, +  I ] haven't even met, {F uh, } someone outside of my area of information systems except for, -	24
{C so } he said, {F uh, } {D well, } he did comparables that it's about <noise> eighty dollars,	24
{C So. } -	26
What I've typically found when that, uh, -	24
it doesn't matter what age you have,	24
Get that unemployment way up	9
Okay.	13
we're in Maryland,	24
Okay.	15
yeah,	36
{C But, } I remember from her checking around,  she ended up staying at the Arkansas House I think out in Arlington, something like that.	24
Yeah,	26
{D well, } With all the commercials -- -- and everything.	26
# {E I # mean, } basically?	7
I didn't much care # for the first one.	24
<laughter>.	20
{F Oh } yeah.	15
-- {C and } when it's properly tuned up,  that starter will last for a long time.	24
{C but } there's some great, {F uh, } folks, {F uh } -- -- that have been well trained,  and, again, {F uh, } [ to, + to, ] {F uh, } recommend gardening for this area.	24
{C and, } {F uh, } {D well } there's salad	24
there are quite a few of your s-, -	26
Right.	36
Right.	36
You're kidding?	21
{C But } [ [ I like, + I like ] every, + I like  [ the, + {F uh,  the ] ] information shows	24
He, {F uh, } had moved, {F uh, }	24
{C and } she has flower gardens and bulbs, perennials and things.	24
{D Well, } [ they really are, + {F um, } they're really ]  sweet dogs.	24
We don't have, {F uh, } the turbulence -- -- have a, {F uh, } little bit of chop,	24
And they stick around for longer.	9
A bit <laughter>.	9
{C and } coincidently {D actually } my wife is Syrian.  {F Um. }	24
Have a nice weekend.	38
(( pas- ))  <<very faintly>> -- -	26
[ he, + he ]  used it, <throat_clearing>	24
Yeah,	36
she's probably, -	9
Yeah.	4
when I, -	26
Kennedy,	24
I don't like to get one of her books	24
They make good fertilizer in the garden.	25
Just an accounting clerk.	24
# {F Oh, } uh-huh.  #	15
{C and, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C But } we, -	26
Yeah.	15
Good,	21
# I was going to ask who won <laughter>.  #	24
{C And } the buttons turned on it [ ove-, + over ] the winter.	24
yeah.	36
{C so } -- -- [ he's, + he ] has been going to private since  kindergarten <laughter>.	24
My grandmother lived with us, {F um, } until August, {F um, }	24
[ they, + they, ] flew, -	26
[ It's, + it's ] over two hours long.	24
I never was too mechanically inclined,	24
{C but } I don't know who they are, {D you know. }	24
{F Um, } {D well, } I've made a lot of baby gifts <laughter>.	24
# {F Oh } my. #	21
{D well } they're going to beep us pretty soon.	24
# <Static> <laughter> Right <sniffing>. #	15
{E I mean, } [ there's, + there's ] been a lot of, {F uh, } -	26
he's [ in, + in ] Florida jail now,	24
beyond murder or just beyond {D like } first degree murder?	14
Overall, Arlington is good, one of the better ones in the state,	24
{C But, }  [ [ typically, + {D you know, }  basic-, ] + {F uh, } typically, ] {F uh, } everyone gets involved in, {F uh, } the jury process	9
{C And } there are distinct breeds in Europe.	24
A sabbatical <noise>.	8
[ I, + I'll  ] take the passing teams any day.	24
{F Oh, } is that right?	12
It shouldn't cost more than thirty-five bucks  for something like that, {D you know, } reasonableness.	9
Yeah.	15
{C and } I think, {D you know, } [ she would, + she'd ] put her arm around the kids and talk to them and stuff, {D you know, }	24
This is a great subject because they're out there gardening, {D you know, }	9
Exterior.	24
I think the major thing they need to  correct is how long it takes something to get to jury, and to get to trial.	9
and I'm wondering, you know, um, what is this,	24
I also think, uh, that, uh, there is a certain amount that comes from automobiles	9
it, it -	26
or? <child>. -	26
Yeah,	36
{C and } they will gladly, no questions asked, take it back if for some bizarre reason you decide you don't want it anymore.	24
{C and } I put it in a two quart saucepan	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
Who are you with?	39
{D well, } the first time we were on this it came just about every day.	24
{C and } <laughter>, -	26
Right.	15
I agree there too.	36
{C But, } {F uh, } we go out, -	24
it's true.	36
{C or } -- -- {F uh, } that's what I think is a big one.	9
{D see } [ I, + I ] lived in, {F uh, } Ohio mainly.	24
{F Uh, } {D you know, }  {C and } it's [ sort of a + <laughter>, sort of a ]  crass perspective <laughter> -- -- on the usage of capital punishment,	9
Pardon me?	14
Uh-huh.	15
Right.	15
{F Oh } really.	15
I sure do like the looks of that new [ Mit-, + Mitsubishi ] Diamante.	24
not every morning,  it probably averages about two days a week --	24
{C And } you could always find some channel that had something on	9
<Noise>.	20
Is it a bug, You mean?	7
{C And } they had a little, {F uh, } theater company there	24
Right,	15
{C And, then } we would do a similar thing, {F uh, } at {F uh, } ten forty-five because, {F uh, } C N N would be wrapping their hourly coverage up	24
Just supervised more or less than anything and security, I guess.	8
{C because, } {F uh, } you have deaths.	9
Yeah.	15
<Laughter> {D Well, } Becky, you know, even if you lived off your own land, that you would have to put caution signs,	9
{F Uh, } {E I mean } I include everything  from groceries to insurance to car payments to credit card payments, {D you know, } everything.	24
{C and <laughter>, # so } # it's like it really made the rounds	13
-- {C and } if they would vote with their conscience and with what their constituents feel, I think, {F uh, } we might have [ [ a, + a lot better, ] + a lot more ] efficient running government and a lot better laws passed.	9
Yeah.	15
{C and } as luck had it, {F uh, } she had puppies the same week my daughter was born,	24
{C So, } [ I, +  I ] grew up fishing.	24
It's the oldest town in Texas.	24
it's not unusual, for example, for somewhere around here [ [ on a, + on a, ] + on a, ] -	24
[ [ {C and, } + # {C and } ] she, +  {C and } she's ] real, -	24
I can move up,	24
I did get some material <throat_clearing>  -- -- and studied every bit of material that  I could study,	24
{C But, }  {D actually, } {D you know, } when you look [ at, + at ] Minneapolis as compared to where I used to live, it's really quite a bit better. {F Uh, } because I came from Florida	24
probably not enough,	9
{C And, } [ it's, +  it's ] really hard  on them,	24
Yes.  Yes.   *[[should be two slash units]] You found some members of your church that had been murdered?	13
{D You know, } when is the sun going to come out?	16
[ {C So, } +  {C but } ] there was one thing that he couldn't stand	24
{D Well, } hope they follow through and everything.	24
{F Oh } really.	12
{C or } do we,	35
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	30
You probably have enjoyed getting away from the snow.	8
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{D well, } I guess I have used it once or twice.	3
{C And } since they've moved to where [ they are, + they ] let the cat out. -	24
{C And } we need expert cooperation.	9
{C but } now I want to learn how to knit again.	24
{F Oh, } {D well } my favorite, {D well,  }	24
you don't see that much.	9
{C but } those guidelines have  to be set up,	9
[ That's, + that's ] right.	36
maybe people are [ a little, + a little ] more, {F uh, } free to express their opinions, socially free.	9
{E I mean, } [ there is, + # [ it's, + it's, ] # ] a blackening seasoning.	24
{C and } I realized that it's the exact commentary that you have -- -- on the, {F uh, } the news.	24
{C and } [ we have, + {F oh, } I find that I have ] the time,	24
Are they a hard worm?	7
{C But } I'm wondering how many women actually major in engineering.	28
I don't think I went to any of them.	24
and Jerry just kept saying you are the meanest person <laughter>.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I was like, {F oh, } my gosh. -	24
We kind of give her the third degree <Laughter>.	24
Yeah.	15
I'm married to a native Texan	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Um. }	26
Lived up north of Los Angeles in Thousand Oaks area, where the Cowboys have their training camp, or used to anyway.	24
so. -	26
How do you feel about your game?	39
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] he was kind of wild.	24
{C and } she's real interested in geriatrics.	24
I know,	36
Do you, when you go to the  ((   )) , -	26
Yeah.	15
{C but } we could never say what we would do if we're not in the circumstance.	9
We bought [ it  sort of, (( your )) + ]  not a name brand because the clones are so much cheaper.	24
Oh.	15
[ they're, + they're ]  like late forties, early fifties,	24
{D Well, } when you decide to.	24
Where do you take them?	39
-- {C and } I try not to make so  much that it lasts more than that week <laughter> --	24
# {E I mean, } did # she earn more money that he did	7
[  She, + {F um, } she ] had somehow gotten the information from T I -- -- and was distributing it around.	24
I really like them.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
{F Uh, } yeah,	4
{D well, } I guess since this time last year I've changed, {F uh, } jobs within the firm I'm with --	24
<Laughter>.	20
I've heard all these stories about,	24
Everybody,	2
{C and so, } [ it's, + I guess it's ] such a growing concern,	9
Traditional --	24
no,	33
the furthest away was Bowdoin, in Maine which is about twelve hours.	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	4
{C and } it was incredibly complicated and difficult.	24
Yeah,	15
I'll be darned.	21
{C and } after work she'd go in the bathroom <laughter> and change her clothes --	24
The biggest part is they have no accountability for what they're doing.	9
{C So } they, -	26
Yeah.	15
they're so, bad.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh,	15
Yeah,	15
[ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C because } ] if   you have, {D you know, } two, {D well, } if you go to work, you're, just working to pay for day care, # two # or three, {D you know, } {F um. }	9
I've had a par and a birdie, and a bogey	24
we had our auto shop out there and our ag shop	24
{F Uh, } {F oh } eighteen.	24
{D So. } -	26
{C and } -- -- it was hard to treat her equally with my child.	24
the kids cried when I took them,	24
lightning or something knocked it out	24
Right.	15
<Laughter>  That's great as a kid though, isn't it, {E I mean, }	7
{F Uh, } that -	26
{C So } [ I, + I'm ] a federal employee.	24
-- I can't think of his name.	24
Oh, yeah,	4
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	36
Yeah.	15
yeah.	36
{C but } they stay there, # -	24
{C and } I think the one [ in, + in ] Brazil is closed,	24
{D Well, } I feel that we're way behind.	9
I, {D you know, } -	26
{C And } I'm convinced [ [ that, + that, ] + that ] at least twenty-five percent of our school participated in [ some sort of a, + some sort of ] group.  {D You know, } [ ac-, + activity ] {D like } that.	24
Uh-huh.	15
They are doing a whole bunch better.	24
Yeah.	15
[ som-, + some ] kids are so spoiled nowadays	9
# Yeah. #	15
Wow.	21
{F Oh, } man,  this is too scary, that is just too scary.	21
# [ {C But, } + {C but }  ] that # doesn't work.	32
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } I don't know,	19
I don't think I'd know what to  do if it wasn't there, {D you know. }	24
{C and } we put a certain amount in each month	24
if, -	26
Yeah.	15
{E I mean } all Winter long <laughter> he's been wanting a pool in the backyard.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I think that keeps [ a lot, + some ] people from exercising.	9
{C And } I use the Celltrex.	24
And, {D you know, } any other aspect of your life,	9
{C but } it came together in this book,	24
Uh-huh.	15
It's pretty much {D like } get there	24
{C And, } {F uh, } someone said that was a lot of fun to go do.	24
<Laughter>.	20
-- {C and } plus there's a build up of stress --	24
[ the last, + especially the last ] two years, [ it's rained, + {F uh, } {D what, } I think it rained ] nine inches [ in, + in ] [ one, + one ] of the Junes the last two years.	24
Right.	15
{C So, } I travelled a lot around the country and met a lot of people.	24
{C and } they have a really good  ((   ))   for the whole weekend. -	24
I live right on a main thoroughfare,	24
{F Oh, } do you?	12
# [ we, + ]  (( that one would count )) , #	26
Yeah.	15
I don't know,	19
it really does <breathing>   *[[ Looks like a slash unit to me ]] I like shrimp better   *[[ These seems to be independent of A.55 utt 2 above, not a continuation ]]	24
Both of them were great.	9
{C but, } -	26
and that was only for a few years.	24
{C so } that's kind of hard to have a budget.	24
that's a start.	9
{F Um, } {F um. }	38
{C but } these days they're not, {F uh, }	9
Empowerment issues.	22
{C but, }  {F uh, } -	26
[ This is, + {F uh, } this really isn't ] bad stuff to fly around in.	24
It's really nice at, -	9
uh-huh.	15
Oh.	15
{C so. } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } the food's already served	24
you can go  [ and, + ] to a particular restaurant or  whatever,	24
# Visit,	30
My goodness gracious that's, -	21
it doesn't hurt you.	36
They can go fishing.	24
-- {C and } very few people carpool --	24
# Right. #	15
The only reason I really enjoy the Eagles at all is because, {F uh, } I really like  Randall Cunningham.	24
<Throat_clearing>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
we have [ two, + two ] living areas and  a dining room and a big kitchen	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } you are, constantly,	36
{C because } [ that re-, + that got ] [ national attention, + national attention, ] I guess, having a woman governor -- -- running against a man and whatever.	9
You always look for things [ with, + with ] this terrible recession that we are in, {F uh, } to see if there is any go-, -	24
Huh-uh.	33
My, {F um, } <lipsmack> parents have one	24
{D Well, } I guess because he was so rich, {D you know. } -	9
<Laughter>  Yeah,	36
{D Well, } that's a very interesting food though	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } my goodness.	21
I like that,	24
# exactly.	36
-- did [ you, + {F uh, } you ] work in the, {F uh, }  computer business, is that what you said?	7
{D Well, } I understand that <laughter>, {D you know. }   ((   ))	21
Uh-huh.	15
# That just isn't coming through # -- -- is it.	2
# Yeah.	36
Uh-huh.	15
I was so anxious to have them	24
<Laughter>.	20
I just can't disagree  (( with you )) , with  (( {D you know } ))  the basic premise.	24
Right,	36
Uh-huh.	15
yeah.	26
{D so } {F uh, } # what do yo-, # -	39
Is that where it is?	7
All right.	13
{E I mean, } what basis, {D you know, } of comparison do we have really?	12
{D So, }  you're right,	9
{C so } I  ((   ))  school and said hey, let's, {D you know, } find a place that has a nice job	24
{C but } [ he wrote, + he wrote ] the ILLUSION, and [ A BRIDGE OVER TI-, + A BRIDGE TO FOREVER. ]	24
my medical coverage is with an H M O --	24
# Uh-huh.  <laughter>	15
{C and, } {D you know, } go like [ our, + our, ] {F uh, } -	24
{C And, }  {F uh, } a big percentage of that was used up during that conflict also.	24
there are two people who say well he just looks guilty, {F um. }	9
{D like, } {F um, } {D you know, } {D like } Wyatt's Cafeteria.	24
Pacific Science?	14
And I quit <laughter>, you know.	24
Yeah,	15
{C but, } it's so much easier to go to mom,	24
Even better than ROGER RABBIT insofar as animation?	7
{D Well } what's scary is, {F uh, } {F uh, } about two, three, four months ago [ on a Sun-, + in the Sunday ] edition of what is called the morning paper here, The DALLAS MORNING NEWS.	24
He's on five seventy here.	24
Yeah,	15
{C and } they don't seem to, -	9
Okay,	38
Uh-huh,	15
What is she?	39
It's really good.	11
{C and } I lived  [ in, + {F uh, } outside of ] Boston for five years	24
from the one stand point, it is work.	24
Yeah,	15
# It's the # looper that goes around the city --	24
{F Oh, } that ought to give their  programming trouble shouldn't it?	7
{C but } leasing it is fine.	24
# Because, {F uh, } [ he just, + he ]  didn't, {D you # know, } -	24
{F Oh, } I have.	11
Huh.	15
-- {C and } you're seeing them, {F uh, } get, {F uh, } elected to, {F uh, } <static> political offices. {F Uh, } not near enough.	9
-- {F uh, } <noise> {D you know } even the national news I just find it to be {D you know } -- -- very watered down,	24
{F Oh, } sure.	36
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } I suspect that it is possible.	9
{C but } that, -	26
#  # {C But, } # -	26
they camp out --	24
Yeah,	36
{F Uh, } [ I, + I ] like all kinds <laughter>.	24
{F Um, } something [ that + [ I, + I ] think that    I've noticed that ] -	24
{C And } {D see } that's the thing,	24
{C and } now, -	26
<Cough>.	20
{C and } we started out without kids, of course, and found it much easier to save and used to do a lot <noise>, more fun kinds of of things and, {F uh, } did really, {F um, } {D you know, } have a real strict [ budg-, + {E but, }     budget  ]	24
Uh-huh.	15
it seems to me like there ought to be a means [ of, + of, ] {F um, } not having to take everything before a <child_talking> full court.  {D You know, }	9
yeah,	15
{C because, } [ I, +  I ] just live to read.	24
Uh-huh.	4
{C But } you could start your own anyway.	24
{C but } I'm not sure I like that <laughter>.	24
{F Oh } yeah.	4
uh-huh.	4
I think, one, the women, {F uh, } in the work force.	9
Yeah <laughter>.	15
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } [ [ I'll, + I'll take that, ] + I'll take that ] ((   ))  and think that through a little bit.  {F Uh. }	24
{D So, } Trying to work myself out of a job <laughter>.	24
{E I mean } it gave people jobs --	24
I think [ in a, + in a ] way it's good, in a way it's not.	9
{D Well, } the cooperative learning is a technique that  was tried initially to integrate the public schools.	24
{C and } some of it runs off right away [ into the, + in to the ] streams and rivers	24
Right.	36
and she just, uh, she wants to be around human beings	24
{C So } what we want to do is next year  keep driving the same cars and, {F um, } pay on the student loans, split that car  payment in half and pay, {D you know, } double up payments on both our loans.	24
It's not too bad.	24
I guess [ I, + I ] got to say, [ if that's the subject, + if the subject is ] do I feel that we're well enough equipped to, -	24
[ [ I, + I, ] +  in fact I ] was in Texas for a little while.	24
{C and } she started a group going in the neighborhood	24
I think they should.	9
{C but } the taxes would be, {D you know, } <breathing> perhaps, maybe one-third -- -- {F uh, } of, -	24
{C and } having seen other countries, I'd much rather live here and  pay taxes, than live somewhere else and not <laughter>.	24
# Right. #	15
{C And } one of the things we discussed was,  {D you know, }   [ [ where our, +  where   the  budget situate-, ] + how   the budget situation ] just got so out of hand.	24
do you do your own, {F uh, } # lawn in terms of, # {F uh, } mowing?	7
yeah.	15
Okay.	30
{C but } the, -	26
Yeah	4
not bad.	6
They're kind of formula oriented.	24
that's true.	21
[ I, + I ] do it on my own schedule.	24
somebody was telling me, -	24
[ That kind of -- + --  {E I mean } it ] just makes you wonder how people  get guns.	9
{F Oh, } sure.	21
Uh-huh.	15
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] everything else, {D you know, } they can have a good time in.	9
if I'm home on Mondays, then [ I, +  I ] definitely watch her.	24
it was really strange,	9
{C and } I like new age stuff.	24
{F Oh, } that's nice.	21
# {C And } she thinks, {A yeah,	24
there was an interview done on the assistant chief of police for Los Angeles, the guy under Gates,	24
{C but } it's starting to bleed through and burn through because the paint's real cheap	24
I really would.	24
{F Uh. } {D Well, } one of the things, I think that is  most desirable for the elderly [ and that + ] is routine.	9
{F Uh, } even, -	26
{F um, } essentially I was one of the nerdy types in high school really which meant that [ I, + for one reason or another I  ] didn't pay much attention to music,	24
I went to [ a, + a ] liberal arts school, {D actually, } at first,	24
{D Now } [ how many, + how many ] people are in his immediate family?	39
{C And, }  {F uh, } yeah	36
What's a good apple to bake pies with?	39
You don't see yourself getting. -	9
what was that book that you were saying to read, again?	39
Did you see, -	7
They're in a very,  {F uh, } tumultuous state right now with the kinds of, {F uh, } adaptations  that they're attempting to go through, {F uh. }	9
-- uh-huh,	15
{D Well } how about KINDERGARTEN COP?	31
Sometimes, I think I am going crazy trying to do it	24
{D Now } [ I, + I ] know the ones where you're really ill, we visited a long time ago when -- -- she had a grandmother that was in one.	24
we need to cut some of our spendings, cut some of the fat off the top and whittle it down to the rest of us.	24
{F Oh, } okay.	29
{D See, } I think that's wonderful.	21
{F Uh, } rides or runs?	7
{C And, } {F uh, } I really think that [ if, + ] {F uh, }  like after the second World War when women went to work in factories and all that, that was {D like } out of necessity,  because the men weren't here anymore.	9
{C So } [ I, +  I ] don't know if that varies from state to state  or if it, -	24
{C but } it's hard [ to, + to ]  face the corruption, like you say, [ and, + {F uh, } and ] to know what you're up against.	9
Right,	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } -- --  ((   ))  I think the big problem, though, [ is, + is ] they send these <baby_crying> off to large labs --	9
{C but } they  had regular little places [ they, + they ] would hang it, {D you know } -- -- to cure it and so forth.	24
We got it at a little bit of an incline.	24
{F Oh, } that is nice.	21
Yeah.	15
{C So } I try to, -	24
Yeah.	15
Okay Randall, {F uh, } {F uh, }	13
I think most people are aware, at least now, common knowledge is that <TV> <noise>, -	9
{D so } you watch DAVID LETTERMAN?	7
{C So, } {F uh, } are you working somewhere then	7
[ I'd, + I, ] -	26
that's so true,	36
[ It, + {F um, } it's ] just everybody has their own taste,	24
Right.	15
it's true.	36
# Right,	36
How do you feel about it?	31
Yeah.	15
It hasn't hurt him at all.	9
Right.	15
Right,	36
{F uh, } if we can hold out til then, {D you know, } I may [ get, + get ]  to where I need a something else, [ maybe, + maybe ] buy a van, because they are,  really, really nice [ for, + for ] long trips especially.	24
{D Well, } that's got to be a big adjustment for someone that's, as you say, lived on a farm for sixty years,	9
[ it's really, + it's really ] bizarre.	9
# Uh-huh. #	15
[ if, + if ] the person who's going to commit the crime -- -- knew that they were going to be punished severely, possibly capital punishment, -	9
-- a lot of times {D like } the news coverage showed all [ the, + {D you know, } the  ] guys who didn't get hurt coming home and all the big parties --	9
{C and } they talk about issues of marriage, talk about manhood, talk about what they didn't have with their fathers.	9
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
{C And  then, } {F uh, } {D well } it is, -	26
{C but, }  {F uh, } -	26
{C and, } {F uh, } [ in, + in ] those situations, {F um, } what I did is [ I'd, + I went ] in	24
{C And, }  of course, there {D you know } you have a specific place to put your paper.	24
yeah.	26
{C but, } {F uh, } since I've had children it has changed a little bit,	24
# You don't like Patsy Cline? #	7
Yeah <<faint>>.	15
# {D Well } [ I, # + {F uh, } {F uh, } I ] know it.	24
{C and then } <noise>. -	26
{C but } [ they, + they ] were never that interested in it anyway.	24
<Cough> <<someone in background>>.	20
The rooms are nice and large	24
Sit there and laugh,	24
{F Um, } I'm a single mom	24
Minneapolis-Saint Paul is very clean --	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
Yeah.	15
[ {C and, } +  {C and, } ]  on our one little section of the street we all know one another  and know that we're not moving <laughter> and  different things like that.	24
Oh.	15
{C And, } {F um, } I was going to make that,  red beans and rice with [ the, + those ] Cajun sausage and French bread with garlic butter and stuff,	24
Right,	15
That's right,	36
<Baby_crying> she works full time.	24
it's curious, I don't know why, don't know if it's, -	9
You too,	38
for a while I'll ask people if they know what happened --	24
This was several years ago	24
{D Well, } Stephanie, what's your position on gun control?	31
yeah	15
{D Uh-huh, }  getting through to anybody.	24
{C and then } I don't think we projected what was going to happen after the war,	9
Yes, {F oh, }	15
{C And, }  {F um, } {E I mean, } I'm really, -	26
No,	33
Uh-huh.	15
Decorating -- -- and, {F uh, } getting ideas for a garden.	24
sure we gained from it, # because # we were allowed to continue our employment and, # continue # our family	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C but, }  when you have to send that back in the mail with your name on it, your salary information, [ I, + I ] just have a real hard time doing that, {F uh, }	24
What's the season?	39
-- {C so } that I use, because I travel some.	24
how's the weather been in Plano?  <Laughter>.	39
{F Um. }	26
Yeah.	15
-- unless an employer has a reason to -- -- believe that [ his, + ] {F uh, } the work competency [ of, + of ] the [ employ-, + employee ] [ is, + is ] hurting the business.	22
I should have taken [ [ the, +  the, ] +   the, ] {D you know, } {F uh, } option when that was there,	24
{C But } then as I got older and studied in school, I realized it was even going on before that.	24
that's right. #	36
Right,	36
# {F Oh, } really? #	12
[ I, + I'm ] not really sure what  Texas law, I think there's a check for  ((   ))   felonies, on your record.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah <Throat_clearing>.	15
<Throat_clearing>.	20
{C or } he works in [ a, +  a ] movie [ th-, +  theater ] {C and } [ it w-, + it helps ] the projectionist.	24
Yeah.	15
{F Um, } sure.	11
[ {C And, } + {F um, } {C and } ] another question to ask is if they're, {F um, } state certified -- -- {F um, } {D you know, } if the teachers have, {F um, } their Master's degree [ in, + in ] child education and -- -- {F um, } child development.	18
{C And } I would hate to have to hear any kind of case, involving a violent crime or anything.	24
{C And } if we find one on sale before then, then we can just take that and put it towards <breathing>, -	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	4
Hi, # Nancy. #	6
that was seventy-three, seventy-four kind of before [ the, + the, ] {F uh, } the Civil War really picked up down there,	24
[ it, +  it ] looks really [ po-, + potent ] stuff.	9
{C and } I said -- -- look, you guys are all into car payments,	24
{C but } they're just a real pretty boot,	24
uh-huh.	15
You got to kind of make people want to do the right thing.	9
I don't know  what your percent is [ on your, +  on your ] car payments --	24
Huh.	15
I understand.	21
yeah,	26
<Laughter> Okay,	15
Uh-huh.	15
When a new restaurant opens up, they usually send out coupons.	24
I have one that's a freshman in high school, a daughter.  And a son who's a sixth grader in a middle school.	24
They pick numbers	24
Not a bit.	24
{D well, } that's a, -	26
I see.	15
I don't see any need for it when I'm charging something,	24
I don't care what you do to them.	9
{F Oh, } absolutely,	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } -- -- # [ that's a + # -- -- # that's a ] # vicious cycle, of course.	9
Hundre-, -	24
That's interesting.	21
You know what I mean.	38
That's what they look like.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C so } when we went and voted the next time, I asked the, {F uh, } lady, I said I want  my son to come in with me	24
{C and } she was excited about it	24
# {C And } # it was just, {F uh, } amazing to me,	24
# {C Or } pay for it # after school.	2
{F um, } something I do   (( is a ))  fruit, -	24
{E I mean } they can't stop you from doing it.	24
Oh.	15
{D Well, } luckily he drives a big old tank <laughter>.	3
Yeah,	15
They encourage it?	7
{C And } the teacher kept saying, {F oh, }  he has a May birthday.	24
{D Well, } just keeping up with the times, # that's all. #	27
{D Well, } too many kids [ and, + and ] I think too many infections and things coming in.	9
Those things can really upset your budget [ when they, + when they ] come in.	9
{C and } I went and I test drove it	24
{C and } he had murdered her.	24
{F Um, } {F oh, } I like to listen to all different  kinds of music.	24
Yeah.	15
We had an interesting experience the other day.	24
{C but, } some of them we learned from a book --	24
{F Um, } {C and } [ [ [ i-, +  i-, ] +  it, ] +  it, ] -	26
-- {C and } they have, {F uh, } -	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And, }  {F uh, } it turned out  that the, {D you know, } policeman survived to the point that he was able to, {D you know, } identify the guy.	24
{F Oh. } I was wondering if all vans did that,	8
Okay,	36
Uh-huh.	15
that's kind of like, # -	26
Right.	15
Yeah.	36
<Clicking> {F Uh, } # a lot of  ((   ))  I guess is. # -	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } [ I, + I  ] hope, {F uh, } the next fishing season, that I can sort of get back in and, {F uh, } enjoy that.	24
{C And, } yeah,	26
There have been a couple of times when  [ [ the, + the,  ] +  {F uh, } whatever the ] subject was, I guess caught my interest and I went along with it	24
{C but, }  [ we pra-, +  we went ] that way.	24
and  yet there's, -	26
which is just outrageous	9
[ {C so } +  {C and } ] that was a call waiting.	24
Do you have any other kind of music that you like?	7
<Laughter> I'm thirty,	24
Right.	15
{C but, } {F uh, } {D you know, } I went to a college that was fairly local	24
{C So } if you have someone [ that, + that ] destroys that value -- -- {F uh, } then [ what + ] you want to take steps to, {F uh, } minimize the loss.	9
I just did not have those things.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Because sometimes it is a burden having them all day because I can't -- -- # do anything # with them here.	24
that the higher they get, the, {D you know, } -	26
# Potato salad and, {F uh, } # -	8
Really.	15
{C but } the minute marks are done, they're like hearts.	24
{C and, }  {F uh, } [ they have a good, + they have a good ] choice of things that are very different sounding.	24
{C and } the whole thing would be full of water.	24
Yeah.	36
What about in international trials.	8
it's like throwing a nickel away.	25
I do, too.	36
-- <Lipsmack> {C and, } {F uh, } I now am learning to be a sys admin [ on, + on, ] not only P C -s, but, {F uh, } [ pers-, + ] {F uh, } professional work stations -- -- as well.	24
I've learned a lot from it.	36
{C and [ then, + then ] } [ we, + what we've ] done is caused a big problem that proliferates itself.	9
{E I mean } how. -	26
{C And } it's just, -	26
All right, nice -- -- talking with you.	38
I know we could.	9
{C And } I can see it continuing on when they are adults.	24
<Throat_clearing> The ones that what?	14
{C And } the only, -	26
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] I'm at the age, too, where the, -	24
Right.	15
Yes.	15
Right,	36
{D well, } we have two little kids,	24
{C so } if there's [ people out there  that are willing to, +  {D you know, } kids that   are willing to ] sacrifice their time and energy.  Gosh, we ought to use them. {D You know. } If their willing to do it.	9
{C so } -- -- it might have to be something that  they might consider doing [ as a shir-, + that's got to be very short ] term.	9
<Laughter>  Yeah.	15
{C But } when we moved in, {F um, } -	24
{D Well, } the thing that I'm <children> wondering about is how we get a new congress.	24
The, {F uh, } {F uh, } -	26
It had a different feel to it.	24
Yeah,	26
yeah,	36
Tonight I was, {F uh, } helping my kid with an essay on, {F uh, } Stalin.	24
I have a recipe if you want <laughter>.	37
{C and }  there's just not that many opportunities to wear it.	24
it's really August that it happens.	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ [ if the, + if the, ] + if ] people lose their jobs, then they become a load	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
my daughter thinks that any time she sees newspapers <talking> bundled up, they're being recycled.	24
Seems  like [ a, +  a ] lot of people don't  hold human life quite as high as perhaps they used to.	9
<Laughter>.	20
# Yeah,	15
Yeah.	15
{E I mean if } you feel like you need to give them something to help  them out, fine,	9
Wisconsin has [ a, + a ] law in which we need to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag -- -- and they are tested for, {F uh, } their pollution control equipment,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } [ they, + they ] were so  destitute	24
{C and } even when his job is not going to be with people all day long, he said it's just part of the uniform and the expected image that they have to dress.	24
{F Oh, } okay.	15
Good-bye.	38
I don't know,	19
what I read when the, {F uh, } [ lee-, + ] {F uh, } United Nations was setup [ in, + in ] San Francisco, one of the first things the Russians wanted to do was bring in each one [ of the, + {F uh, } of these, ] {D you know, } republics, as a separate country,	24
I'm watching SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE here.	24
Gorgeous.	21
{C and, } I tell you, we really want to go -- -- a lot	24
No,	33
{E I mean } it's  a lot of work to see that she's <barking> prepared	24
Be charged their eighteen percent interest,	9
-- {C but, }  {F uh, } -	26
{D Well, } [ the + ] <breathing> for  some people, it's good because [ they +  maybe they ] need a little discipline, need a little  reining in at [ that, +  that ] stage in their life.	9
What do you teach?	39
Right,	11
{C so. } -	26
Yeah,	36
Yeah.	4
<Throat_clearing>.	20
Right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yes <laughter>.	36
{C and } I am making every effort [ to, + to ] [ sal-, + put ]  a little bit away and increase the amount that I need for a down payment or whatever.	24
# Yeah,	15
That's right,	36
She'll have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of preschool in a year --	24
It's, means they have to drive a little bit,	24
{C so, } {F uh, }  {D you know, } [ let's, +  let's ] stick with that original trust, I guess.	18
What I hate is, -	26
Well, I, -	26
And to actually sit,	24
uh-huh.	15
is it called Baldwin or Bebble?	7
right?	23
-- {C and, } {F uh, } I just,  {D you know, } -	26
I guess our immigration history, that's a great subject.	24
{F Um, }  I've never worn, -	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C But } yeah,	4
-- [ about, + about ] the most baseball we get is {C either } T V {C or } we play it on Nintendo.	24
Children are so full of energy.	9
Uh-huh.	15
# <Laughter> # {D Well, } I'll tell, -	26
[ I was, +   {D you know, } I was ] {D like } conditioned to it --	24
Yeah,	36
Yeah.	15
[ Do, + {F uh, } does ] this school your son  goes to, do they, {F uh, } [ re-, + require ] to wear a uniform	7
{C And so, } it's just kind of strange,  {D you know, }	9
trying to think.	17
Uh-huh.	15
-- what else to say, -	26
# {C And } they recommend.  #	2
{D Now } do you have little kids, or what?	7
[ when they, + when they ] have teachers' holidays, and that kind of stuff, I will take my friends' kids, that are usually in day care,	24
{C And } what we want to do is, {D you know, } make them, and then maybe take them to these craft shows or -- -- flea market things [ and s-, + and see ] if we can sell some of them.	24
Yeah	15
[ Or, + or ] even have had [ the ability, + {D you know, } the chance ] [ to, + to ] go to college or [ [ to, + to ] +  -- -- to ] learn about, -	9
{C but, } {E I mean, } every now and then it breaks, {D you know, }	24
{C or, } -	26
Oh.	15
I haven't had much spare time lately <laughter>	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
{F Uh, } okay,	26
{D you know, } people didn't like him.	9
our backyard has so many [ bi-, + ] tall trees in it that [ there jus-, + there wasn't ] even a blade of grass in the backyard.	24
That's the same way here, isn't it?	7
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, }  I guess, [ what part of t-, + what part of the ] country do you live in?	39
Gosh,	21
that's a lot.	21
{C and } now they just want to sort of speak up and say Hey,	9
{C And } these people,  <inhaling> {D you know, } [ in the, + in the ] course of the trial, {D you know, }  came up [ with, + with ] all these, {D you know, }  things about {D well, } {D you know, }  they were disadvantaged and all this stuff.	24
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
[ [ we, + we ] didn't bo-, + we didn't bother ] buying a scale.	24
{F Huh. }  {D Well, } -	26
{C and } there's a lot of Mexican people too.  Which is not, neither here nor there,	24
When they're skiing they're fearless,	24
I lived in the suburbs of Saint Louis,	24
I want to do it about the same color.  And just be a little, -	24
{F Uh, } {C but, } {F uh, } no	13
{C And, } {F um, } I like to read books on improve, like family, marriage, {D you know, } things that are written by {D like } Christian authors or, {F um, } doctors about family and, {D you know, } how to improve your home and all that kind of thing.	24
But I think, uh,	26
Yeah.	15
I want to do it	24
[ [ we, + we, ] + we ] believe in what he's doing abroad	9
{F Um. }	15
And?	31
-- {C but } they don't,	32
# {C But } # this looks like floor covering on the wall.	24
Right.	38
I know that though, [ I, e-, + ] all those petroleum products though are so terrible for [ your, + ] {F um, } <lipsmack> the water table.	24
{F Oh, } that's pretty good.	21
Yeah.	15
{C And, } {F uh, } my husband accuses me of putting him through dessert depravation,  because, {F uh, } {D you know, } we have ice cream, <laughter> or something like that.	24
{F Uh, } I guess my particular beef is that having participated in the [ mi-, + military ] off and on [ over the, + over the ]  years of being called back and things of that nature, is, {F uh, }  I've found that, {D you know, } there's an extraordinary amount of waste.	24
# That's right.  #	36
<throat_clearing>.  {F Um, } it was really funny, {D you know, } that he would tell me where to stand and how to hold my arm [ and, + and ] how to, {F uh, } follow through with my, {F uh, } -	24
{C but } he's really strong in math and science, too,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C So, } {D you know, } [ we're, + we're ] thinking about that.	24
Absolutely.	36
# ((Uh-huh)). #	15
{D You know, }  [ it, + it's ] one thing to get motivated to start doing the exercise,	9
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } you get, {F uh, } one free	24
[ {C and, } +  {C and, } ]  {F uh, } I've done pretty good at it.	24
Day lilies.	24
{C So } <laughter>, I don't know,	19
# run, # -	2
[ It, + it ] was kind of interesting, {F uh, }  some people complained about, {F uh, } {F uh, } the kind of whining or whatever on it.	24
{C Because }  [ y-, +   e-, ]  {F uh, } -	26
Yeah,	15
{C or, } {F uh, } [ they, + they've ] signed for a friend.	24
I tried knitting first,	24
{C And, } {F uh, } I'm not capable of lifting what, {F uh, } a man can lift and -- -- {D you know, } [ that type of, + that type of  ] thing,	24
{C And } I've told her, {D you know, } everybody I know that  has seen it has said that the three hours go really quick.	24
{C and } when the water comes up, it comes on again,	24
{F Oh, } yeah,	15
Yes,	13
{C and, } I guess the job that I'm in it's stuff to stay on any kind of a regular schedule.  *[[listen; possible typo - stuff = tough?]]	9
{C But } as far as writing checks out and paying taxes,  I think it's pretty high.	9
Uh-huh.	15
-- I'm only up here temporarily on an internship #	24
Maybe when the kids get in school that will be, {D you know, } -	24
I was kind of surprised how rapidly they bypassed, the three eighty-six.	24
Yeah,	36
I suppose you're absolutely right there.	36
[ I, + I ] know it, {F uh, }	24
{C and } the next semester they were required to do weight lifting.	24
{C and } we have to try to swim out.	9
Yeah,	15
-- {C and, } {F uh, } the basics premise is that if water was a food [ it would be, + ] {D you know, } they wouldn't be able to sell it to you through your pipes because it's toxic <noise>.  {F Um, } chlorine,	9
Uh-huh.	15
My daughter was a freshman in college when we bought it for her.	24
He said, {D you know } the plot line and the characters, {F uh, } {D you know } aren't real big	24
Yeah.	15
<Laughter>.	20
yeah.	15
{D Well } do you think [ we, + there's ] a final accounting, yet not, in the since of pennies an nickels,	7
Right.	15
Any kind of, -	26
# I have been just # so happy.	24
{C and } last year [ they, + they, ] got, {F uh, } the state level.	24
That's right.	36
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
I don't have access either. Although, I did at one time	24
[ [   It, + it, ] + it ] is very strange.	21
We're looking at buying a house,	24
Yeah,	15
{C and } I knew we were going to find him, {D you know, }	24
{C and } he hated that.	24
[ [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] + {C and } ] [ do we, + do we ] support the Sandinistas [ or, + or ] do we support, {F uh, } -	16
I bet you used them all up over Christmas.	8
we always had, {F uh, } big concern about hurricanes,	24
{F Huh. }	15
{C but } still there's a lot more than there used to be.	24
I just know that, {F uh, } my in-laws [ up in, + up in ] Oklahoma, that's how [ they do, + {D you know, } they pick ] it up,	24
he had my vote double <laughter>.	24
It's for research.	24
{C And } I thought, this is not right.	24
you can unfold them.	24
{D Well, } it was good to talk to you.	38
Yeah.	15
[ tha-, + {E I mean, } {D you know, } that's  ] the way I felt about it.	24
{D You know, } {C so } he just left warm-ups on,	24
Right.	15
Yeah,	15
Right now I'm kind of off.	24
if, [ he, + ]  something would happen to him, I wouldn't stay in Texas,	24
Maybe it was November I'm thinking about.	24
No,	36
At least they might <<voices have faded>>  get some benefit in that,	9
# Really.  #	15
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
How about you?	31
{C so } <sniffing>, -	26
{E I mean } [ that's, + that's ] the question.	9
{C so, } Uh-huh.	26
they just raised our taxes up here about a year ago.	24
And {D like } hide and seek,	24
I've lived in cities that really haven't had that much of a problem, although, {F uh, } I'm really kind of based in Orlando, Florida	24
yeah. #	26
{F Um, } {C and } I think we choose [ very, + very ] carefully the, {F um, } alternative situations that we had them in.	24
They've got a nice one.	24
That would be nice.	21
{D well } that's the reason why I like both of those programs is because they're kind of based on books.	24
Yeah.	15
<Noise>.	20
# Uh-huh # . <<faintly>>	15
[ {D Well, } + {D well, } ] Pat, did you vote in the last election?	7
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
[ [ [ they're, + I know they're trying, ] + they're really trying, ] + the Mexican government is trying, ]	9
{F Uh. }	26
It was real interesting,	9
Oldies or what?	7
{C and } lo and behold, about five days ago, we had a freeze  down to about, {F oh, } twenty-three degrees or something --	24
That is true.	21
uh-huh,	4
{C And } the one boy killed himself a few years ago, [ in the, + in a  ] grade school,	24
{C but } I have [ on a lot, + a lot ] of times.	24
{C and then } you get those Visa bills in.	24
uh-huh.	15
{C And, } right	15
{C and } they climb in easily	24
Do you get your own washer, dryer?	7
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
yeah.	15
{F Oh } how does he do serious.	31
[ I + <laughter>, I ]  have, -	24
Good heavens <laughter>.	21
How many square feet do you have?	39
{C and } it had a built  in, {F uh, } grill	24
<inhaling> [ {C And, } +  {C and } ] that is not emphasized.	9
I feel like they focus too much on  things that, {A I don't know, } {D you know, } -	9
#  ((   ))  [ e-, + ] right.  #	15
{D like } [ the, +  {F uh, } at night the ] discussion talk shows and things. -	24
{C and } they are beginning to be a budget problem but,  {F uh, } have not been really [ up until this, + up to this  ] point.	24
uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	36
it's more, {F uh, }  concentrated, so they know where you are.	24
{C And } the only thing we have with the skunk, he was very, very protective of his territory -- -- being the sofa and the blanket on the sofa.	24
You bet.	36
Isn't he though,	16
{C And } I just, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
[ my, +  my ] husband  and I are taking a computer class at our junior college <laughter>.	24
yeah,	15
I know more about them and watch their growth and how they improve [ and, + and ] learn much more so than my own kids.	24
Yeah.	15
what <laughter> minuscule amount I made -	24
I mean he works it out every month -- -- and breaks it all down.	24
Stuff I guess that mostly public, on public T V.	24
yeah,	15
{C and } we can't paint the chimney <laughter>.	24
Right.	15
{C And } one might be a hat day where you have to come up with some -- -- sort of hat.	24
I've had excellent food there.	24
{D Well, } off and on,	24
{D well } good talking to you.	38
{D Well, } this is kind of ironic  because I work in T I -s legal department.	9
{C And } I'm going to, -	24
let me see, Trinity,	17
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } {F uh, } we live in [ a, + a  ] brick home in far north Dallas	24
What branch were you in?	39
Right.	15
Michael Jordan really helped them out.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I, {F uh, } -	26
yeah.	15
{C And } they usually go to Carmel and vacation on the beaches,	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } maybe it's because, {D you know, } we've had our own propaganda over the years,	9
Very protective,	9
right.	15
Make sure you smack him around then <laughter>.	18
<Laughter>.	20
{F Oh, } I have some relatives out there in  Texas,	24
[ {C So, } +  {F uh, } {C but } ] {D you know, } its like, {F um. } -	26
{F Oh, } uh-huh.	15
[ I, + we ] used to have one of those little caves you can go back in -- -- get out of the rain.	24
{C And } I think that's true,	9
{C and } it is really nice. Where the island of Hawaii, you can't really lay on the beach over there.	24
You know, that's not good enough.	9
As a civilian that's never been attached to any form of the military,	24
# {C And } the people # making these calls would be obliged to [ c-, + compare  ] -- -- [ the, + their  ] lists -- -- that they're going to call against this list of people who don't want to be called.	9
Go somewhere really nice, like Hawaii, and just <laughter> -- -- look at the golf course.	9
yeah.	15
{F Oh, } boy.	21
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] that's kind of frightening.	9
This generation, -	9
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } I see.	15
I would hope that they would help some, though.	9
# yeah, #	36
Right.	15
right.	36
Yes.	4
Okay.	29
all her kids are grown,	24
that's true.	36
At least they kept the business part of it.	9
It just seems like I here it  on the news the day before.	24
one of the biggest complaints  I well remember because I spent a lot of time with seniors, {F uh, } was, {F um, } carrying their  ((   ))	24
{F Oh, } I think that's great.	9
I did, {F uh, } [ forty, + forty ] miles,	24
{C and so, } that was almost an example of [ s-, + ]  an invasion that turns out to be not invasive.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C But } it sounds like, {D you know, } [ you, + you ] learned from it	22
{D well, } # good talking to you. #	13
Yeah.	15
[ I think that, + I think ] he really, -	26
Yeah.	15
{D So, } -	26
# {F Oh, } that's great. #	21
[ I, + I  ] wonder [ how, + how  ] you instill in people the necessity for doing just a little bit extra [ to, + to  ] make this whole thing work.  {E I mean, } the extra like washing out bottles and jars, or the extra of actually, {F uh, } making sure that, {F uh, } you take stuff over to, {D you know, } -	24
-- {C and, } -	26
{D Well, } I guess in cases like  [ that, + ] {D you know, } where the guy would, obviously, go out and do it again -- -- {E I mean, } you've got to do something.	9
<Static> {D Well, } I would say as, far as social changes go, {F uh, }  I think families were more together.	9
{C but, } I didn't enjoy it necessarily --	24
{D Well, } <laughter> I guess the, {F uh, } most interesting one that's, {F uh, } going on right now, from my perspective, is this, {F uh, } phenomena of, {F uh, } {F uh, } Ross Perot.	9
# {D Well, } # how do you get the edge though?	39
<Laughter>  Good luck on that one, then.	13
{C But, } {F uh, } what kinds of things do you and your family do?	31
that, uh, you know that children can't, cannot be allowed to grow up, uh, you know, without really close supervision.	9
Okay,	13
{C and } I would imagine their learning disabilities  are quite large in some cases.	9
{C So } I think it's a good idea	9
-- {C and } we have, {F uh, } three teenage daughters	24
I heard a joke on the radio yesterday [ that, +  in regard that ]  he didn't design the patriot missile system,	24
Yeah.	4
I know.	36
that's great.	21
{F um, } I guess we're going to [ talk, + ] describe, {F uh, } job benefits,	24
{F Oh, } instead of hopping and jumping you just step	22
{C and } they went and [ they, +  they ]  built, {F uh, } <laughter>  {A can't think of a good example, } a swimming pool, or anything,  {D you know, }	24
{D well, } I found that after a couple of years of having a PARENTS magazine it was getting repetitious,	24
{C but } you can probably empathize with this.	9
{C But, }  {F uh, } the one on opposite the street now,  they're total brick	24
Yes,	4
{C And } this is a rare exception.	24
Uh-huh.	15
they took the top management and gave them jobs -- -- [ [ with the, + with the ] corporate, + {F uh, } at the corporate ] front office	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
it [ rides, + rides ]  rough,	24
{C But } [ as, + as ] far as, {F uh, }  regular T V  shows, {E I mean, } I've got [ some, + some ] shows [ [ that, + that,] + that ] I would be afraid  to admit to you that I've actually sat down and watched <laughter>.	24
And, and it was quiet,	24
I'm a physician.  # {F Uh } # -- -- [ and, + ] as is my husband.	24
That's very spicy, too.	22
What age, {F uh, } if you don't mind me asking.	39
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } it was fully cooked and  everything.	24
Right now some of the things I'm working with are kids that are dealing with sexual abuse,	24
They sent us a little booklet,	24
Yeah.	15
{C But, } {F uh, } -	26
Absolutely.	36
{C and } you have a kind of a  captive audience,	9
[ I think we, + I think we ] did pretty good.	9
one day I walk	24
Okay,	29
{C and } you said, {F oh, } I got somebody down in Texas,	24
[ the difference, + {D yeah, } the difference ] could be that for, {F uh, } [ state, + {A if there is such a thing, } state ] felonies versus federal felonies that [ federal, + things that are under federal ] jurisdiction require the unanimous <inhaling> vote,	9
Uh-huh <<faint>>.	15
Do you, think we ought to, {D you know, } back off on our support of the country	7
Yeah,	36
{C and } I've taken care of a few AIDS patients.	24
{C So } my husband's just discouraged me on those things.	24
# {D Well, } # how do you feel about setting, {D like, }  {D well, } for example, [ a car type accident  where, + {F uh, } {E or } some incident where someone loses a limb.	31
[ an older, + one of our cars is an older ] car,	24
((   )) .	20
# {C and, } # {F uh, } after I got married, -	24
{D Well } I have two small kids	24
The real estate out here's been pretty good.	24
{C So, }  it's real fun.	24
it's talking about these, {F uh, } drug tattoos now -- -- that they have got.	24
[ Do you work with, + do you work around ] children when you work?	7
{F Oh, } no,	36
-- {C and, } {F um, } {F uh, } I did have surgery last summer	24
It's [ not + <laughter>, not  ] a real good one actually.	9
I, I know that when I'm, when I'm behind a car -	24
{F Uh, } {D now } I think the change that I've seen as much as anything is one where couples, {F uh, } are more carefully planning their intention on how to both share homemaking duties and also how women will, {F uh, } have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place.	24
We'll have to see, because [ it's, + ] {F uh, } there was some talk about that.	24
[ I, +  {E I  mean, } I'm ] a technician.	24
-- {C and } there was no such thing as a job or any hope of a job,  [ unti-, + {D well, }  unless, ] -	24
(( {C So } )) , -	26
I think like things that, that -	26
Uh-huh.	15
It's, uh, story about a little boy in  [ a Italian, +  a little Italian ] village,	24
{C And } [ my + ] boss is a black woman and has only been there a couple of months and already promoted	24
Oh.	15
I me-, -	26
[ that, +  that ]  whole record was pretty good.	9
# {C and } # they do it again, {D you know. }	9
I don't think it's done.	9
{C but } he was talking, wouldn't it be nice to carpool,	24
I guess I, -	26
But I, you know, you've got, you've got the industry,	24
{C and, }  {F uh, } {F uh, } he's a, -	26
Interestingly  ((   ))  in Honduras, It's very pro-American.	24
{C and, } {D you know, } I enjoy that.	24
{D Well, } {D see } we took our time	24
Uh-huh,	15
{C and } it got better than,  I think twenty-two, twenty-three miles a gallon.	24
<Laughter>.	20
I saying teachers should be paid more.	24
{C But, } it's still, {D you know, } -	13
{C But, } {D you know, } I'm not going to  complain because Plano [ got, + we all got ] a pay raise this year.	24
[ they, + down here [ they, + they ] ] stopped for awhile	24
{C and } I said that means that I can't work on it.	24
{C And } you kind of get absorbed in it	9
Uh-huh.	15
you, -	26
yes. Uh-huh.	15
right.	36
Have you ever been there?	7
For example down here, when you go up to a gas station -- -- you get an extra charge for credit cards -- -- than you would by paying for cash.	24
Yeah.	15
There's no # doubt about it. #	9
what did I say, Peter?	39
Did you see [ it, + him ] when he was doing the coverage of the Gulf?	7
-- # that's about the size # of most of them.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
{D Now } did you say you could knit?	7
Yes.	4
Right.	15
Right.	15
{C and } my husband talked to the people in Utah,	24
{C so } {E I mean } he can get within, -	24
They're huge.	24
{D Well, } listen, {F uh, } I think  [ I've, +  I've ] exhausted my, {F uh, } self on, -	24
Uh-huh.	15
No.	36
[ [ wel-, + th-, ] + I ] guess I haven't had that much experience.	24
{F Uh, } {D well, } it's actually, {F um, } waste water.	3
[ you're, + you're ] aware of that kind of thing <laughter>.	9
{D Well, } I'm just saying [ I shouldn't, + I shouldn't ]  blast him like that, say, {F oh } {D well, } Laufenberg got out there and blew it for them,	9
{E I mean, } {C and } they bring the, {F uh, } {D you know, } little samples --	24
{F Oh, } that would, be a nightmare.	9
{C and } it served me real well, too.	24
{C So, }  we try to hit those places when we can.	24
[ I, +  I ] guess I have  similarly broad tastes.	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh,	36
Of course.	36
{D well, } {F um, } {F um, } it may be that, {F um, } it was recently replaced, by actually [ by, + {F um, } by ] what may be my favorite T V show  [ of, because  sort of, + ] {F uh, } {F um, } TWIN PEAKS.	9
[ {C But, } +  {F uh, } anyway, {C so } ] I guess that's about what I did when I entertained.	24
we're going to solve, try to solve -- -- the AIDS problem [ while, + while,  ] {D you know, } some people are getting killed here and there	9
Yeah.	15
Okay,	29
Uh-huh.	15
if you want to do something every night that's fine,	9
I, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
[ I, + I ] just really can't deal with that	24
we moved, {F oh, } last August	24
{E I mean } these bell peppers and curry.	22
# it's because [ there's not a # + there's no  ] [ insulation, + <noise> insulation ] in those things.	24
{C or, } -	26
That's what I was going to say.	24
Yeah.	15
[ you get, {F uh, } more or  less, + {F uh, } you get ] basic electronics courses that, {F uh, } deal with, {D you know, }  not only the digital circuitry but, {F uh, } {D you know, } power supplies [ and, + and, ]  {F uh, } just the whole gambit, but mostly towards, {F uh, } computer electronics.	24
after all the things that I've seen in the last ten years about government and now the overdrafts, {F uh, } of checks, {F uh, } before that it was the wonderful, {F uh, } escapade that they had with, {F uh, } the new, {F uh, } {F oh }  (( God )) , chief of, {F uh, } -	9
I think that is one of the reasons  [ that they have, + they have ] pretty much avoided getting involved in South America.	9
Do you live in the District?	7
{C But } [ it's, + {F uh, } it's ] just fabulous food.	24
-- {C and } to me that's more important.	9
{D You know, } how that goes <laughter>. -	13
I mean they have Yeltsin [ who may, + who may ] yet sort of help Russia.	9
{F Oh, } is that right?	12
A good weather man,	9
They're, {F uh, } <noise> <<sounds like some sort of machinery>> sort of remodeling a house out in downtown Atlanta, in Candler Park.	24
{D Well, } {C but } the majority of them are  [ in, +  {D like, }  just {D like } how you said in ] [ close, + close ] quarters.	3
{C and } I don't, {F uh, } do any planning	24
I, -	26
-- it's like if you drew a line from  Austin straight down, it would be in that region.	24
it's the hand kind, # old # fashion kind <laughter>.	24
okay.	29
{D Well, } {C but } I can't see that either.	24
I [ did, + {F uh, } did ] not.	24
{C but } as far as cars I've never, never been involved with them.	24
{C So }  we're just learning the ropes here	24
{C Cause } cooking is a little bit [ like, + like ] being in a chemistry lab.	9
{F Oh, } great <breathing>.	21
{C Because }  (( by ))  the vanilla  doesn't seem to thicken as well as the, -	24
{C But } {E I mean, } [ it, + in the back of my mind, it ] always bothers me.	24
Right.	15
{C but, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } the transmission may be made in Japan or whatever.	24
it was a real old one --	24
A kid in, -	26
They have a university in Moscow called the Patrice de Lamumba University.	24
{C But, } no,	13
I'm -	26
so. -	26
Yeah.	15
{C and } it just takes a long time to get it done	24
Asleep At The Wheel.   *[[all caps for titles]] {F Uh, } Sons of the Pioneers, {D you know, } stuff like that.   *[[all caps for titles]]	24
[ Do you, + Do you ] think that you should fund that if they have that as a benefit, if you would fund that somewhat from your salary that you are getting?	7
{C and } America does have a long history of sort of doing things our own way <laughter>  rather than adopting, {D you know, } some other model.	24
If you get pleats and  all kinds of, -	9
<Laughter>.	20
{C but } I can't stand owing.	24
<Laughter> {D Well, } our department used to  collect the cans anyway for the Christmas tree project.	24
{C So } I find that it makes up for what I  pay for insurance	24
<Laughter> Oh.	15
Yeah.	15
Especially when you have a lot of problems with the  children teeth, [ and, + and ] you have to really get them when they  are young, in order to have, {F uh, } not, {F uh, } a decent smile when they  are fifteen, sixteen years old.	9
{C and } I came up spittering and sputtering for air	24
# {D You know, } # [ The, + the ] experience [ is, + is ] better up here, I think.	9
{C And then } if you find out that they are not having good care, {D you know, } I'm sure that [ it is just, + {D you know, } you'd  pull ] them out of there so fast.	9
{F Oh, } is that right?	12
[ It's + It's ] very easy to do.	9
[ It, + it  ] reminds me of the old time movie magazines when I was young --	24
Yeah,	15
{C And, } [ we have, + we have ] hills.	24
# {C So, } # {F uh, } what's d-, -	26
<Laughter>. {D Well, } I think, [ I, +  I ] never have liked to cook food,	24
{C So } do you just have two kids	7
Yeah.	15
It's just gorgeous over there.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F oh, } definitely.	36
Yeah <laughter>.	15
Right,	15
[ That's, + {F um, } I've found that ] when [ I, + I ]  don't have cable television anymore, {F uh, } when I moved, went back to graduate school I just didn't have the money to [ buy,  ge-, + rent ] a cable T V line, or whatever, {D you know. }	24
{C or } I would have called for their salesman to come out.	24
yeah.	15
{F Um, }  [ I, + I ] noticed yesterday in the paper, something said that it, -	24
I think I would rather a person go ahead and be put down than give them the <baby> opportunity to get out and do it again.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Right.	15
You too.	38
{C But, } {D Well, } I think we probably reached our time limit.	38
and by the time I paid taxes on it, it, I was getting like eighty cents	24
<Throat_clearing> Actually, I think other countries may  have it worse, {F uh, }	9
Yeah,	36
[ I agree, + [ I, + I, ] agree, ] {D you know, }	36
{F Oh, } really, {F oh. }	15
-- [ I, + I'm ] sympathetic,	24
the only other place I've ever vacationed, we'd, {D you know, } go on  camping trips  up to Texoma and things like  that.	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
{C but } I wouldn't want to go teach high school or junior high,	24
[ What, + what ] do you do?	39
{C And, }  {F uh, } one of the, {F uh, } <sigh>  {D you know, } {F oh, } -	24
{C but } I'm sure you have plenty of trees.	24
{D So, } [ are, + are ] you going to go for your Doctorate?	7
{F Oh } no.	21
# <Laughter>.  #   *[[slash error]] # <Laughter>.  #    *[[slash error should be 'x']] {F Oh, } {D well, } let me tell you,   *[[slash error]] # There are days when # I would [ be + (( prefer  ] )) , # really doing that <laughter>.  #	13
Uh-huh.	15
Do you have any [ l-, + ] nieces or nephews <Laughter> (( then )) ?	7
Uh-huh.	15
There's nothing physically wrong with her, except she's very, very old,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Just minor little ball here or there, {D you know. }	24
He said that when he graduated, the day after his bar examine -- -- there in Houston.	24
and. -	26
{F Um, } I think that if from every year [ when they, +  when they ] pull in [ [ the, +  the, ] +  the, ]  {F uh, } test that the last three years, {D you know, } ten, eleven, twelve [ year, +  {F uh, }  graders ] take,	26
{C but } {D you know, } [ that's, + that's ] what happens when, {D you know, } the cork blows	9
Yeah.	15
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] you could have them around long enough	9
{E I mean, } the comparison made between New Kids On The Block with the Beatles <laughter>.   It was just, -	9
one Sears.	24
{C But } we have got more women in it now.	24
Uh-huh.	36
-- {F um, } did you all ever think about purchasing that one, when it comes out?	7
Right.	15
{C but } since it's just the two of us, it's <laughter>, -	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } they still keep asking you, {D you know, } and keep badgering you about it,	24
what is it, {F oh, }	1
{C and } most of the houses around here were built pretty much the same style <breathing>.	24
{F uh, } when you go in and  buy a weapon or a handgun in, {F uh, } {F uh, } Virginia, <breathing> the salesman just calls  some number and, {F uh, } punches in your name, <breathing>	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	36
{C but, } {F uh, } I'm just curious what he has to say now that they've got them all lit.	24
{F uh, } [ there, + {D well, } there's ] a little bit of difference [ in, + in ] the two between my mother and my mother-in-law.	24
I work for T I,	24
[ kids don't, + kids are bombarded ] with all kinds of junk	9
I think so.	9
Oh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
They just see that this guy prays differently and to someone else than I do.	9
# I # think those should be uninsurable.	9
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] [ I, + I ] helped him when I was growing up,	24
yeah,	15
I guess that is the point,	24
{C So, }  {F uh, } # I used to deal with, # -	24
True.	21
an article. -	24
Yeah.	36
Yeah.	15
[ Are, + are ] you from the Maryland area?	7
[ When, + when ] # our kids were small we had a couple of, {F uh, } [ good, + good ] women who, {F uh, } would often [ c-, + {F uh, } get them to come ] to the house.	24
{C and } I hope to make twenty-five which -	24
# A little hot.  #	2
the, -	26
[ We, + we ] tried a dog about four years ago,  {C and } we ended up with, {F uh, } {F oh, } malamute and some other kind of mix.	24
{C and } I think it's going to be pretty close to his demise if he doesn't <breathing> follow suit with Yeltsin as far as, {F uh, } <breathing> realizing, -	9
{D So,} {F uh,} [I, + I] think they should have at least some control over, over those things.	9
Yeah,	4
It's like  white glue,	24
Oh, yeah.	15
I think for about twelve months through September [ the, + the ]  average temperature has been higher than normal -- -- each month. {F Um, } lots of ninety degree days during the summer.	24
You too.	38
I haven't [ really, + really, ] -	26
Yeah.	15
did you receive information from your skiing magazine?	7
that was so that he couldn't leave her,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
Plano's doing real good on that.	24
{D well, }  yeah,	15
the automobile regulatory agencies or something.	22
{C so } it's hard for me to get it somewhere	24
[ not, + not ] were we are.	24
I guess that's another thing  that to me is [ a, +  a ] real problem,	9
Where do you live now?	39
Radio seems to have a full platter or full plate of  different things that they need to get done.	9
Uh, the only other thing I have noticed though is that, uh, it seems that there's been a lot of or more empha-, emphasis at least in what we've been dealing with -	9
{F Um, } here in Maryland to the capital punishment law, -	26
[ Are you, +  are you, ] -	7
Yeah.	15
Do you seem to get it straighter,	7
[ Y-, + yeah ] <breathing>.	15
{F Oh, } like a Miata or something like that?	8
{C Because, } {D you know, } there is so many people that broke either  their water main or their gas main doing it.	24
{C So, } she's kind of got that option, [ if, +  if ] they wait till later,  they've saved up some money,	9
{C and } [ I, +  I ]  think that we learned from that	9
# Yeah. #	15
[ I, +  I ] actually don't think  that we, {F uh, } pay too much in this country.  {F Uh } -- -- {F uh, } particularly, {F uh, } in  this part of the country w-, -	9
They're ahead,	24
Yeah.	15
I've never quite understood that.    [ I've never, + ] {F uh, } {D you know, }  even though, {F um, } [ I, + I've ]  never been, {F uh, } sort of politically minded,	24
{F Oh, } okay.	29
this one, on this one hole <laughter>.	25
She's more into the animated stuff, where my other daughter liked puppets and that kind of thing	24
It's sort of interesting though, because he does bring [ a, + a ] much, {F um, } different perspective with all the Gulf goings on, {F um. }	24
{D well, } I think pride in our country and our flag is so important.	9
The judge did.	24
{C but } {D well, } {D you know, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I've ] liked a lot of the new music.	24
yeah,	26
yeah,	15
{C and } <laughter> one day my husband had the kids	24
-- they are not all things to all people -- -- or all children.	24
A disturbing movie,	30
over there on the Texas border you had a lot [ of, + of ] groups heading  for Mexico	24
Yeah,	15
{C and } as soon as he stopped working out he just ballooned out.	24
{C And } [ I hate, +  I hate ] living paycheck to paycheck.	24
{F oh, } {D well, } Tuesday nights I guess, we try to catch a couple of the shows that the kids like.	24
<Laughter>.	20
Do you plan on {D like } adding any rooms or, -	7
{F Um, } I like Texas, {F um, } not having the state income tax	24
Yeah.	15
not the world's most pleasurable thing	9
{C and then } they go into the fourth grade	24
# [ {C And then } they # -- + -- {C and then } the people ] default -- -- on the loans.	9
it's not ventilated properly --	24
{D Well, } and also to make it economically feasible. {F Uh, } and [ per-, + ] [ ti-, + ] also in buses.	9
I think, {D you know, } there's a place and a time for all of the tests and comparisons	9
# Yeah. #	15
{C And, } {F uh, } came home and got married	24
Yeah,	15
they're not very heavy, {D see } --	24
<Laughter>  {F Uh. }	15
What,	39
I'm still single	24
{D Well, }  {C so, } they evacuated it <laughter>.	22
[ {C So, } + {C but, } ] I get to come home [ at, + on ] the nineteenth	24
The old, real old, yeah.	36
{C So, } you're right.	21
Never overheated it.	24
Now, they've been able to get some good players and come around	9
{C so. } # -	26
One of them's a Compaq --	24
# Yeah.  #	15
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
I'm doing that more and more than I used to --	24
Right.	15
{C But } I wonder how much longer they're going to be [ a + them. ]	28
{C And } I think that is only right though, {D really. }	9
Uh-huh	15
Yeah,	36
{D Now, } you, -	26
Uh-huh,	4
Yeah.	15
Sure.	15
{F Uh, } now there always has been a federal law against fully automatic weapons.	24
and, uh, they go negotiate the price for you.	24
We've got the New England Patriots up here	24
[ [ It, + unfortunately, it's  a, ] + {C and } it's a ] business or an occupation that the results are not as tangible -- -- # as other ones	9
Yeah,	15
# Gosh. #	21
which -	26
[ My, + in fact, my ] mother in law just visited.	24
{C and } -- -- {F uh, } {D you know, } it does.	24
[ [ we, + I, ] + I ] can't really say that we have hobbies.	24
-- {C and } eventually they'll have to do something with that.	24
They wouldn't even talk probably about some of the things we're talking about now.	9
{C But } I see him very rapidly becoming the engineering personality,	24
Yeah,	36
{C So } [ that's, + that's ] probably the worst thing I've ever had happen with a credit card.	24
{E I mean, } you start off, # {D you # know, } especially, {F uh, } -	9
Yeah,	36
{F Uh, } I used to live in the Plano school district,	24
Right.	15
maybe so.	15
{D well, } then have a good day.	38
they, -	26
They don't, {F uh, }	26
{C And } there probably some other things that I don't about because we're a real large company.	24
{C But, } -	26
{C and then } we got into different  {F um } themes {D you know } <breathing> {F um }  whether it would be ethnic food Or {F um } sometimes it would be  {F um } <click> oh Oh I don't know  maybe  an outdoor theme or {F uh } elegant theme or  {D you know } <laughter> <laughter> -	24
I normally take that week somehow, {D you know. }	24
just, I've kind of got a collection going of tapes now,	24
{F Uh, } what sort of camping do you like to do the most?	31
I guess for the cost of them you don't really, -	9
[ it was, + it was ] not a good, -	24
And besides that I kind of learned I wasn't really that good <laughter>.	24
Do you like it?	7
Uh-huh.	15
there's something about the human character in it --	9
I grew up most of my childhood in Germany.	24
Yeah,	36
<Lipsmack> [ {C But } + {C and } ] I've been out trying to find a job because this is <noise> just not cutting it.	24
{C but } I do now,	24
Yeah.	15
No,	33
# Is that right? #	12
Right.	15
{F Uh, } {D so, } {F uh, } [ how do you, + how do you ] feel?	31
Yeah,	15
I know it,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Okay.	15
No,	33
{D Well, } isn't it very hard to teach young children and then come home and  deal -- -- with young children. And have enthusiasm.	7
{E I mean } just the way that we're affected by when it's cloudy out -	24
<Laughter> Well, it has been.	11
I enjoyed our discussion.	24
Okay,	13
{C But } then we started thinking, especially in Plano, the weather <static> is so  hot in August, that there really isn't a lot the children can do outside anyhow.	9
I think it's an, # excuse to do nothing	9
I don't have a headache any more.	24
This is pretty [ un-, +  unseasonal, ]	24
That's what I used to think education was all about  when I was a college professor	24
<laughter>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
{C and, } {F uh, } it sounded like it would be an interesting project -- -- to participate in	9
Uh-huh.	15
((    ))  {C and, } {F uh, } -	26
I enjoy being with her --	24
# Uh-huh.	15
{C So. } -	26
{C and }  he'll be getting three weeks vacation.	24
{F Oh, } yeah,	36
we'll, we're going to be in the market for a car, probably in the next year	24
{D Well, } that scares me because if [ th-, + that's  ]  the way they are, -	24
{C and then } my husband wasn't going to be able to watch it with me,	24
{C so, } -	26
<Laughter>.	20
{D Well, } he was until this operation.	34
No,	33
<Laughter>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
I still don't know that much about football, obviously.	24
Yeah,	36
<Laughter>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Oh.	15
{C And } [ her, + her ] time frame  was prior to the nineteen forty-nine revolution.	24
{D Well, } I'm <<fade out>>. -	26
-- {C and } we spend weekends [ at the, +  in the ] country with them -- -- quite a bit,	24
I am kind of happy with it,	24
Type it out, uh-huh.	30
[ {C So, } + {C so, } ] -	26
Yeah.	15
{C And, } {F uh, } -	26
Watch the weather channel so that we know what the weather's going to be like.	24
# {F Oh, } yeah. #	15
Or sand even some of them,	2
{F Um, } {E I mean, } certainly if you look at them compared to, let's say, {D you know, } {F um, } eight years ago or something, [ [ [ [ they're + -- -- they're, ] + they're, ] + they're, ] + {D you know, } they're ] sort of  [ in, +  in ] good standing, whereas, {D you know, } {F um, } <noise> <<knocking sound>> [ I think, + I certainly don't think ] they're the eighty-six team  any more.	9
I came down from Colorado	24
when you get further east towards New York City it gets very industrial --	24
{C But } [ she's, +  {F uh, } oh she's ] [ ve-, +  very ] heavy in that	24
{C But } we haven't done [ [ m-, + l-, ] + whole ] lot of it lately.	24
I said now, {D you know, } {C so } he's learning the hard way	24
My folks talk about it a lot in Illinois.	24
Spectacular is a good word for them <laughter>.	36
Right,	36
{C but } for the most part we're all between the ages of eighteen {C and } like twenty-one --	24
[ I w-, + I didn't ]  have that much money	24
[ if our gra-, + if our grandchildren ] are with us, [ that's, + they ] have to watch that.	24
Well, let's just hope that the powers that be, uh, have time to, a little bit once in a while to, to think in some farther reaching avenues than you and I do here tonight	9
It's more hectic,	9
{D Well, } that's what I worked on.	24
<Breathing>  {C So, } [ [ I, + I ] would have really, + I haven't really ] priced, {D you know, } in the market,	24
You've got the little bitty ones.	22
Maryland is probably one of the most expensive, places to, -	9
I took her from Enid, Oklahoma to Oklahoma City every week for six weeks.	24
{D You know, } {C and } also, the  [ whole, +  whole ] thing with noise. -	24
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } good.	21
Electric or, {F uh, } -	7
{C and } my Allante has, {F uh } -- -- I guess [ saddle, +  saddle ] colored type thing.	24
How does it compare to the years past?	39
{F Huh. }	15
[ Maybe -- + -- maybe ] they should be asking someone that's been [ on, + on ] trial before.	9
{F Oh, } yeah,	36
I didn't want to.	24
{C And, }  {F uh, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } [ if, + ]  it came down {E I mean, } as [ he, + he ] came, -	24
{C but } we're learning a lot,	24
it was channel nine.	24
Get a pamphlet,	24
I see,	15
it's a very important part of  your life	9
yeah.	15
Yes,	36
[ I, + I ] can go for  that.	24
Yeah.	15
one thing [ I, + I ]  really liked [ about, + about ] the Dodge Daytona is the fact that they have, {F uh, } this seven year warranty.	9
Cape Cod style, I guess you'd -- -- call it.	24
Yeah.	15
{C so } it's hard for me to remember where I was when all that happened.	24
[ in terms of, + in terms of, ] {F uh, } the health care, I, {F uh, } find [ that, + that, ] {F uh, } although [ I've, + I've ] been lucky enough to never have any big problems, [ {C but } + ] [ that, + that, ] {F uh, } the cost is not [ a, + a ] big factor.	24
{C And } at one point [ they di-, + they took ] another vote on it,	24
They cause more noise pollution than air pollution <laughter>.	24
{C and } in Orlando, [ there's, + crime is ] getting to be a bigger problem than ever,	24
{C And, } {F uh, } I've been pretty selective,	24
# {C And } # [ it's usually, + the television that we see nowadays seems ] like [ [ [ that + it's, ] + it's, ] + it ] doesn't even have some of the underlying, {F uh, } things to it, {D you know, } that maybe the old movies and things had, {D you know, } the underlying themes and stuff that maybe you had to kind of figure out.	9
[ I was never, +  I was ] born in nineteen hundred sixty-nine.	24
{D Well, } of course,  [ that, + {F uh, } {D you know, } those ] big trucks  [ [ can, + can, ] + probably are ] far more efficient in packing  than any kind of little household compactor.	9
Yeah.	15
That was one of the books I read this   year,	24
Yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
That just, -	26
{C and } they're finding bodies in di-, {D you know, }	24
Yes,	36
I haven't either.	24
You must like chocolate.	8
{C but, } [ She'll  definitely, + {F uh, } she'll ] make the trip for fishing -- -- if <laughter> that comes along,	24
I think right now [ it's, +  it's ]  kind of bad <baby>.  {F Uh, }	9
Uh-huh.	15
Right an, -	36
# What do you think, what kind of # -- -- camping, {F uh, } are you talking about?	39
# {F Oh, } yeah. #	4
# {E I # mean } we need to redo some, rewiring ourselves	24
{D Well, } I guess if I were going to choose, {E I mean, } my first consideration would be safety.	24
Uh-huh.	15
that's true.	21
{C but } I guess I got away from what I consider to be the pot, {F uh, } sounding music.	24
# Yeah.	36
you just kind of have to read and  understand what is going on.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
[ I, + I ] don't know.  {F Uh. }	19
<<faint>>.	20
{F Uh, } yeah.	15
I, I see,	24
Okay <static>.  {F Uh, } <breathing>  let me see.	13
No,	33
right close to where I live is the  (( Seabrook ))  Nucleus site which is, practically a, {D you know, } guerilla war up here, went on for years.	24
No.	36
Right.	15
{C and } they're just so thin and, flimsy	9
That's always nice to get,  {F uh, } reliability in a product.  Especially when you're spending, {D you know, } anywhere from fifteen to twenty-five thousand dollars [ for, + for ] a single item. {D You know, }	9
-- {C and } [ they + <talking> <<women's voices>> they ] check that name against, {F uh, } their list	24
{C or } do I know anyone who has their child in a day care	25
they touch on what's going on.	24
right.	36
# [ {C and } # -- -- I, + {C and } I ] do [ the work on, + most of the work on ] that myself.	24
-- {F uh, } in fact, I think that, [ it, + it  ] affected the sentence though capital punishment is available,	9
I see.	15
I think now they're a lot more expensive than that.	9
Yeah,	15
They were, -	26
They probably didn't know what they were talking about.	9
{F Ooh, } {D well } that doesn't leave a lot of time  for hobbies,	9
{F Uh, }	26
That's right,	36
I got some interesting information about crawfish	24
seems like [ these all, + they all ] went [ to, + {F uh, } to ] leaf,	24
{D well,  }  we both decided we wanted to move to North Carolina.	24
{C and } they'll say, {D Well, } there's a big bass tournament this weekend,	24
[ They needed, + {F uh, } at least at first, # they needed ] # a smaller setting [ that, + that ]  was more like family where they could get one-on-one, # [ from, + # from ] teachers, professors and so forth,  and then after a year or  two move on to a little bit bigger pond [ where, + where, ]  when they had a little more self-confidence built up, {F oh, } {D yes, }  {A I can do this, } {F oh, } {A I've done this before, } it's just in a bigger setting,	24
That's real pretty.	9
{F Uh, } we've not been having many opportunities to see movies lately.	24
{C but, } {F uh, } yeah.	36
{C because }   (( I )) , -	26
{C but } even in, {F um, } litigation which is doing lawsuits, is a lot  of times that you never get to the courtroom itself	24
Needless to say, my sweaters have been hung in the closet for quite a while now <laughter>.	24
{C so } it won't make you sick.	24
{C so } I'm pretty busy.	24
one lives in Connecticut,	24
[ her, + is her ] career, {F uh, } related [ to, + to ] finance or accounting?	7
Yeah.	4
and you can go home and put your #feet up and watch soap operas,#	25
I don't know.	34
# Uh-huh. #	15
No,	32
{C and } at that time, {F uh, } it was [ is + ] a changing time for the whole music scene, I guess	24
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } in other words do we make the world safe for democracy,	16
Yeah,	15
That's true.	21
uh-huh.	4
{C or, } -	26
# Yeah. #	15
<Noise>.	20
As -- -- [ for, + for ] instance, I think you  probably remember the military getting caught, {F um, } with toilet seats  that cost them four hundred, five hundred dollars.	24
Okay.	27
yeah.	4
I go for the big stuff.	24
It's, {D you know, } a lot different than the teams they used to have where it's the same old, {D you know, } players every year and, {D you know, } same coach, same everything,	9
I actually went to the STAR TREK twenty fifth anniversary marathon that happened about a month ago,	24
[  My, + {F uh, } my ] roommate is a, {F uh, } -	24
Yeah.	15
yeah.	15
[ It's like, + # it's like ] [ have you, + [ have # -- + -- have ] you ] ever seen the commercial {D like }  for Federal Express [ where the, + with, {F uh, } the ] think tank? {D You know, }	7
if you didn't like BEETLEJUICE you'll probably won't like  EDWARD SCISSORHANDS.	9
you can really vary it.	24
-- {C so } this is what I do most of the time, {F uh, }	24
I don't have any strong opinions on it.	24
She told me some of the things you can do,	24
{E I mean, } # you just really can't tell what's going to happen.	9
{C and } I know,	24
He's like a dog,	24
Gee.	15
[ {C So, } + {C but } ] [ [ that's, + {D you know, } that is rural, ] + it's a rural ] family	9
Uh-huh.	15
Two.	24
just enough to keep them active.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } I'll keep that one in mind.	37
{C But } I was very lucky  because I was [ a, + a ] college professor.	24
<noise> It's going to say, {F uh, } edited by Charlotte Turgeon, editor of, -	24
they're going to get cards at  [ (( the )) , + ] twenty bucks a pop.	9
Wow.	21
Uh-huh.	15
# yeah. #	4
Yeah.	15
{C and } it's really tough to get into the program down here	24
{D Well, } [ [ Two s-, + two, ] + two, ] {F uh, } {F uh, }  for sure are single.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Right,	15
You just put forms in the ground and fill them with concrete?	7
That sounds, -	21
I read usually that kind of stuff.	24
{D Well, } I enjoyed talking with you Lisa,	38
{F Oh, } I am twenty-seven.	24
<<Very faint>>  Yeah.	15
[ for, + for ] us, {D you know, }   it's like, [ [ I,  I + ] can spend, + I can spend ] that money	24
Uh-huh.	15
I'm talking {D like } hugh companies like Three M, {F uh, } [ I'm, + ] {F uh, } Honeywell, {F uh, } Texas  Instruments # <laughter> # --	9
<Sniffing> {F Uh, }	26
Yeah.	15
# {C Because } I, # -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } no,	33
[ is, + is ] that just the only type of reading you've been doing,	7
the engines were simple and durable	9
Yeah.	15
# We want a # -- -- safe environment for ourselves.	2
{F um, } we have one dog, a Bichon Frise.	24
Yeah,	15
{C and }  Sears is one of the better ones.	9
Uh-huh.	15
# <Laughter>. #	20
Yeah,	15
she really likes all these gory -- -- shoot them up films.	24
You're kidding.	21
{C so, } not too much of that.	24
((   )) .	20
{F Huh. }	15
{F Uh, } I'll listen to shortwave quite a bit.	24
Oh.	15
he's pretty big.	24
Much stronger.	21
[ I got, + {F uh, } it got ] delayed for a little bit [ and, + {F uh, } ] because of work	24
And these are the people that make the foreign policy	9
[ the way I work, +   {F uh, } the way I dress -- -- for work ] is, {F uh, } this year,  nineteen ninety-one has been really suit and  tie,	24
{D Well, } I think they're useful,	9
-- {C and so } my budget comes from my dad's help.	24
{C and } the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably, believe it or not, is just to get the extra nickel at [ the, {F uh, } + the ] store and not, {F uh, } -	9
[ it, +  it's ]  interesting,	9
that's good.	21
{D Well, } what about [ [ our, + our, ] + our ] financial budget.	31
okay,	26
{C but, } {D you know, } as soon as you start, {F uh, } -	26
# Is that scary?	7
<Child>.	20
{C so } they still have their own independence	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
I don't like it when there's mosquitos so bad.	24
{C and } I fell for it	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } [ they, + {D you know, } they ] have tons of canyons where the leaves change	24
{C because } I like Chicago --	24
Right.	15
probably maybe [ that, + that. ] -	9
# Yeah. #	15
{C but. }  Have you seen that?	7
{C so } now I have to carry cash when I go to the grocery store,  which is new to me, {D you know, }	24
# Right. #	15
Yeah.	36
You've had a little bit of variety, {F huh. }	9
That is right,	36
She had her daughter with her,	24
That's right.	36
I really don't use it myself.	24
I read, {F uh, } a lot of Steven King, Dean R Koontz, {F uh } -- -- some Danielle Steel.	24
but, uh, they put up with each other	24
[ Do you have, + do you ] watch children	7
# {D Now } # [ I like, + I like ] groups like that.	24
[ [ {C And } I, + {C and } I, ] + {C and } I'm ] saying to myself, {D well, } {D you know, } [ y-, + you ] dump [ [ your, + your, ] + your ] little turnip off to, {F uh, } {D you know, } this child care place	24
I, -	26
<Swallowing> What if they pay for?	31
Absolutely.	36
If they're [ perp-, + perpetrating ] the AIDS problem, passing that on to each other, then -- -- # {D you know, } # -	24
{D Well, } good.	21
{C And, }  {F uh, } -	26
Yeah.	15
That's difficult.	21
{C and } [ I, + I ] don't think  I'll do it again <laughter>.	24
it's, it's, we can see it work with her,	24
{C and } it will naturally decompose <noise>, {F uh, }	24
{D Well, } I'm also in Dallas.	24
{E I mean, } {D you know, } because once oil gets so, {D you know, } thick and yucky, you'd wonder how they could, {D you know, } clean that up, # enough # to use it again,	24
Is that right?	12
[ [ It's just, + it's, ] + {D you know, } it's ] way to hectic and too confusing.	9
A hundred?	7
We saved the ones from the election	24
Yeah.	15
{C And } keep your mind on positive things	18
I don't know,	19
Uh-huh.	15
(( {C And, }  I )) , -	26
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } see that's one, -	26
{C but } [ I, + I ] just don't think they have the resources, if you were to compare, {F uh, } the Americans to the Soviets as far as home computers are concerned or [ fact machines, + Fax machines ] and cellular phones, and <breathing> state of the art equipment that we are so used to.	9
[ Tha-, + that's  ] right.	21
{C But, }  {E I mean, } that [ did, + did ] more responsibility.   When it's yours and not your brothers <laughter>.	24
in San Antonio it was {D like } every day,	24
{C But } it was very hard on everyone to see, {D you know, } grandmother be like  that,	24
I know, my son is a biker	24
Well, my wife, -	26
{F Um, } I found out too, that, {F uh, } quite often  if I see something on television that I want more in-depth, {F uh, }  understanding [ or, + or ] [ get, + ] want to know more about  it, that [ the, + the ] newspaper or, {F uh, } [ I read + ] NEWSWEEK, can give you a better and more thorough coverage of what I've heard on T V,	24
Pretty close.	30
Wow.	21
<Lipsmack> {C But, } -	26
Yeah.	36
# <Laughter>. #	20
<Throat_clearing>  What is your handicap?	39
Yeah.	15
{C and } perhaps they would be indoctrinated that this is their duty.	9
Where are you from Tina?	39
Definitely.	11
{C but } we have a cat that comes  in and out,	24
first thing that comes to mind is some kind of chain stitch because she starts and  goes all the way across, {D you know, } back and forth until she winds up with this big piece  [ of, + of ] afghan.	24
{E I mean, } I don't know,	19
{C so }  there isn't as much wood that has to be painted.	24
{C and } they're # going, # to fail unless some sort of remedial, {F uh, } education is given to them #	9
that's part of it,	24
{D Well } there nothing wrong with those, {F uh. } [ [ They're, + they're ] nice veh-, + -- -- they're nice vehicles, ] nothing wrong with those.	9
I built him a barn back there [ where, + ] in the part of my corn field,	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } they did learn [ to get, + to get ] along with other people.	24
Bye.	38
[ [ I, +  I ]  thinks it's, +  I think it's ] [ poor, +  poor, ] {F uh, } economics [ to, +  to ] carry all that consumer debt -- -- at least from a tax standpoint,	9
{C and } they also have sales taxes,	24
{C and } they do have that at his place of employment	24
Really?	12
yeah,	15
Everybody cares about the education the kids are getting.	9
{C so. } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C So } it's not been bad at all.	24
{D Well, } {F uh, } I'll tell you something,	13
{F Um. }	15
{C And, }  really,  {E I mean, } I don't mind them.	24
even now, the way we have it now, there are still. -	24
it [ rea-, + really  ] doesn't,	36
There you go.	21
<Throat_clearing>.	20
{C But, } at the same time, there's some fairly good training programs  [ and, + and ] some of them formal two year programs.	24
She doesn't work,	24
that's the way I am. #	24
{C and, } -	26
Sure.	15
{C and } I really enjoyed it.	24
# Uh-huh.  #	15
{C So } any pet that I get from now on  will definitely be spayed or  neutered.	24
{C and, } -	26
and everything in between, {D yeah, } in most states there's nothing to regulate them,   *[[ This would seem to be 2 or even 3 slash units ]]	24
{C But, }  {F uh, } {D you know, }  for right now, they don't, {D you know, } -	24
for a long time were just rolling in the dough in the -- -- early eighties	24
{C And then } the last Civil War battle was fought at  Val Verde, {D you know, }	24
I'm, -	26
{F Um, } {D so } {D anyway, } -	26
<<Very faint>> {F Huh. }	26
# Really. #	15
Uh-huh.	15
they can't, -	26
(( )).	20
[ I d-, +  {C and } I don't ]  understand the reasoning for it.	24
{D Well, } I have a friend  [ that's, {F uh, } de-, + ]	24
Ooh.	29
Okay,	13
{C because } {D like } I'd, -	26
# Yeah,	36
Find out where the languages are.	24
{F Uh, } I'd say it's about an eighth.	5
She doesn't hear very well	24
{C but } my dad's the type he wouldn't want to spend the money on anything.	24
Everybody's in Texas.	9
I think, too. -	26
You're developing your imagination.	9
{C but, } {F uh, } -	26
I think that's wonderful.	21
Are you?	12
Yeah.	15
it's not all bad --	9
Uh-huh.	15
you [ probably +  get [ this, + ]  probably ] pretty sticky after you get done.	9
usually it's the other phone I have trouble with.	24
Did you do the diagnosis, or was it just an assumption that that's probably the part that failed?	7
{C And, } {F uh, } I am an avid gardener	24
You think the problem is not enough doctors?	7
{C But, }  not much [ of, + {F uh, } # of # ] anything else.	24
[ M-, +  my ] solution, -	26
I do too.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } that's true.	36
{D Well } now, That is right.	21
# I don't  work.	24
Yeah.	15
{C And } we could get more bedrooms per square foot that way.	24
I know a lot of people  that talk about exercise and say, {D Well, } I don't want to exercise,  it's too much work.	24
that's <static> the only communicable disease that they're not allowed to test for <noise>, {D you know, }	24
<Lipsmack> {F Um, } I was trying to think, {F uh, } -	24
Do you remember when you were in Washington, Sam the Argentine baker?	7
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
Do you?	23
{C and } it was just killing us.	24
{F Um. }	26
Yeah.	15
Hi,	6
{C 'cause } sometimes I think about it actually,	24
Uh-huh,	36
{C and } find a creek.	24
Right.	15
# I know, #	36
{F Oh, } that's where we go home, too.	24
did it myself. -	24
Chains,	30
{C and } I think  they're going to be, {F uh, } with us forever.	9
{D Well, } [ [ [ they, + they, ] + {F uh, } the, ] + the ] people that (( )) -	24
Yeah,	36
I used to see all those commercials for Windows, {D you know, }	24
[ {C so } -- + -- {C so } ] I dressed in, {F uh, } {F uh, }  a light weight  skirt,	24
{F Uh, } {C and so } I don't know, {F uh, }	24
it's {D like } ugh.	9
How about you?	31
{F um, } she'll know, -	26
{C and } so you'd s-, -	26
(( The, th-, -	26
<Breathing>, how do you feel about it?	31
There is, -	26
[ I, + I ] really listen to a lot of the talk shows, I don't mean the gossip ones,	24
[ We're kind of, + <laughter> we're   really ] independent.	24
{C but, } [ he, + he's ] one who believes in credit cards,	24
{C And } that's probably my question is, [ how, + how ] do you know it's done fairly.	24
Yeah.	15
Are you going to go see the Elixir of Love?	7
<rattling>.	20
{C and } it makes [ a, + a ] bit of a difference, too.	9
{C and } he's into wrestling.	24
yeah. #	4
like I say, it's not a very controversial thing.	9
# <Laughter> That's right. #	36
Someone has been lying to you.	9
[ I + {F uh, } I ] think that while it's a good change for  I think women to be able to fulfill their potential in whatever they feel, {D you know, } their expertise may be.	9
[ I don't, + I don't ] really work in a profession that requires that I wear a business suit and, {D you know, } look really, -	24
It'll be interesting to see what happens.	9
{C so } there is a progressive path,	24
Exactly.	36
<Lipsmack>.	20
{F Oh } my goodness.	21
I've had several minutes to think about this after I, {F uh, } -	24
{C and } she didn't want you getting her wet <laughter>.	24
{D So. } -	26
{F Uh, } {D see, } I'm not a big Julie Roberts fan.	24
[ I, + I  ] agree with you <laughter>.	24
you said that you had a garden.	24
Yeah.	15
second floor, you work with, {F uh, } linear.	8
{C So } I gue-, -	26
Uh-huh <laughter>.	15
{C and } -- -	26
{C or, } -	26
I think there's a lot of [ thin-, +  the economic problems ]  that the country was having at the time and [ the, +  the ] recession and stuff,	9
{C and } if -- -- whoever tried to, {F uh, } {D you know, } credit it to the hilt, you'd only have to pay fifty dollars of it,	24
# Uh-huh.  #	15
{F oh } yeah,	15
{C And } I have three granddaughters right now.	24
"You know whose buying them?   *[[""whose"" = who's""]]"	16
{D Well, } it's really fun.	24
Yeah.	15
{E I mean }    [ [ it's, +  it's   a nice, ] +  that's a nice ] place, though.	9
I'm surprised during this Iraqi crisis we didn't have more incidents than they did.	24
I think a lot of it is just, {F uh, } the fact that in the U S you're so far removed, {F uh, } in a lot of cases from, {D say, } conflicts	9
[ {C But, } + {C but, } ]   {F uh, } that's true.	9
{C but } there are enough laws on the books now that unions are outdated,	9
Uh-huh.	15
You burn up,	9
{F Ugh, } that's about, {F uh, } ten too many.	9
When you have children,  you have to say, now, this is different	9
{C and, } {D you know, } it was seat belt law --	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C an-, } -	26
Like I said, I think it does,	9
Yeah.	15
{C And, }   {F uh, } that makes it a lot more enjoyable.	24
they, in essence, have gotten around it [ by, + by ] listing, {F uh, } decimal inches.	24
[ [ I, + I, ] + I ] watched, {F uh, } Costner <<mispronounced>> on the Academy Awards.	24
# I # like COSBY,	24
{D Boy, }  it is a big problem,	9
one's a seventy-seven	24
how you doing Kevin?	6
[ [ I think, + [ I, + I ] don't think, ] {F uh } <static> <talking>, -	26
# {F Oh, } gosh # <baby>.	21
Yeah.	15
# [ I, +  I ] # would settle [ for the gli-, + ((   ))  for the glitz  ] if the side effects were useful, like the, {F uh, } -	24
[ {C but } -- + -- {C but } ] I do read it, too.	24
{F Um, } I have a sister in Colorado, and, {F uh, } a sister in upstate New York, and a sister in Connecticut, and here I am in Texas.	24
{F Uh, } are you married	7
Yeah,	4
{D So } tell me about where you live.	18
<Laughter>.	20
Because your normal companies that offer it, do not offer it in the amounts that we do	24
# Okay.  #	15
She doesn't believe in the woman working unless she has to.	24
Right.	15
{C but, } {F uh, } one, -	26
-- {C and } it was # outstanding. #	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } okay.	29
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } some of them are limited care too where people can do, {F uh, } -	24
I'm, I used to be a college student -- -- ten years ago --	24
{F Uh. }  {D Well } is there anything else that you look for	7
{C So } it'll give you room to get under it,	22
# {C but } # I went up ten cents.	9
Yeah.	15
{C but, }  {D you know, } a lot of jurors may just sit there and say, {D yeah, }  he's guilty,	9
{C So, }  another thing that we tried to do, -	24
No,	33
Which, -	26
{C And } they got four attorneys,	24
They're both. -	26
[ We, + we ] took a cruise	24
<Laughter>.	20
It's very dry there.	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C And, } {F uh, } we cooked in a pot.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
That would kill me.	24
I have a four year old.	24
{C And } [ that, + that, ] -	26
they, -	26
I think we should have stayed longer.	9
{C Because, } I don't mind doing that,	24
Yeah,	15
{D You know, } {D like } in your, -	26
[ it's, + {F uh, } it's  ] definitely, -	26
I witnessed one trial many  years ago when I was first, {F um, } studying to be a paralegal	24
{D Well, } I've been worried about mostly with having <child_talking> little kids now with taking them out in the Summer and getting them burnt up,	24
right.	36
That's great.	21
{C and } the Mitsubishi, # three thousand  (( G T )) , is the [ same, + same. ]	9
Uh-huh.	15
these people somehow manage to, {F uh, } {D you know, } push on through and are successful.	24
Yeah.	36
<Laughter> I just hate that when she does that,	24
[ I, + I ] imagine [ his, + his ]  opinion is a little bit towards the one # there, # on the -- -- scale of one to ten he needs some more.	8
Yeah,	36
{C but, } {F um, } I think we are suppose to talk for ten minutes	9
{C and so, } like you, we always try to make it, {D you know, } back home to see the relatives.	24
I've seen, {D you know, } {D like } elderly people -- -- that really can't get out too much  ((   ))  sometimes.	24
Uh-huh.	15
We were just all [ grou-, + really grouchy ] when it was over.	24
I know.	36
Yeah.	36
{C but } they do dig up	9
# Go head, #	36
I don't think that.	24
I said as what you're looking for, I think you need to look for [ an active, + {F uh, } an <talking> interactive ] staff. Somebody who is willing to [ work with, + {F uh, } {D you know, } work with ] a patients and [ do -- + -- do ] things with them and treat them, [ treat + ] # like (( they're )) , # -	9
{C and, } -	26
It, it, {F uh, } -	26
All the, -	26
Yes -- -- it is. *[[should this be two slash units?]]	36
Usually try to have [ a, + {F uh, } occasionally a  ] camp fire at night, {D you know, } and -- -- roast the marshmallows and what all.	24
Yeah.	15
It's your risk,	24
{C And, } {F uh, } her husband builds forte pianos,	24
{C and } he said that people have no idea, he said, [ of, + of ] what human sacrifice is, {D you know, }	24
when, {F uh, } the kids were in high school, it was harder to always have supper together,	24
Okay.	15
I am now <laughter>.	24
[ I,  + {F uh, } I ] get calls at work,	24
# Yeah. #	15
{C But } barbecue is it like steaks	7
I do not know,	19
it, -	26
it's, {F uh, } -	26
Yeah,	15
{F Oh, } {D well, } good luck to you.	38
Uh-huh,	4
# {C And, } {D you know, } {C so } it's, # -	26
Yeah.	15
Ourselves is seven point seven five.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yes,	36
Let's just turn it on and see what's on.	25
right <laughter>.	36
Yeah.	4
<laughter> I meant comparable.	24
Right,	36
{C but } I've heard about him.	24
{F Uh, } I'm not so sure I'm in favor of that.	9
# Right. #	15
[ if, + if, ] {F uh, } it seems to be, -	9
{C and } [ it, +  {D you know, } they're ] flying all over with it.	24
{E I mean, } how, {D you know, } is -- -- there, -	26
{C and } now I work out at home, because [ I don't really, +  my schedule with school and work, I don't ] have time to get down to one.	24
{D So, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
I know,	9
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } I didn't see that one.	24
Would that be, {F um, } perhaps, the first grade level, which would be, -	7
{C and } it'll, {D you know, } pass out,	9
Yeah.	15
<laughter>	20
Uh-huh.	15
{C so } it makes it a little bit easier.	24
My husband is a counselor,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and, {F uh, } so } I feel like  this is one way I can contribute that's not too painful <laughter>. Financially painful, anyway.	24
{C and } I think that's one reason they have them, especially older people that I know, that have pets.	9
{C so, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } yeah,	15
{C And } [ I, + I ] think [ the, + ] [ you hear the news, + {D you know, } you start out in the morning, and all day you hear the  news, ]	9
{C and } it never happens --	24
[ [ {C But } it, +  {C but } it's ] +   {D like } the movie is ] so well made,	9
[ late, + late ] sixties, early seventies, [ they were -- + -- they were ] definitely pushing a message.	9
{C and, }  {F uh } -- -- I bought about <laughter> twenty of them.	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C And } I think, -	24
{C and } it doesn't cost the patron anything.	24
{D Well } [ most, + most,  ] [ mo-, +  sort of modern ] looking restaurants will,	24
yeah.	26
Yeah.	15
it gives you energy.	9
Okay,	29
Yeah,	36
They're like a, water bug, of sorts,	24
{C But, }  {F uh, } the way things have changed over  the years with the P C and the different programs is just great.	9
Right.	15
{C and } even like  reading some new age things, things that I don't quite believe in,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } we're going to brick up the garage to match the house and  things like that	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	36
{D Well, } I used to be a real big Cowboy fan	34
{C And then } my neighbor had a little doll made out of wood --	24
{C and } then the following summer, we did not have all of the family there.	24
Yeah.	15
That's, -	26
Right.	15
Yeah.	15
now I would hate to work at a fast food restaurant or even have my children work in one.	24
I can't think of the term	24
Yeah.	26
through other folks [ where I, + where I ] work, -	24
[ {C but } -- + -- {C but } ] [ they were, + they were ] pretty touchy on it.	24
I think they should, {F uh, } {F uh, } pay him what his salary is going to be, {F uh, }  and let him, -	9
It depends on -- -- {D you know, } [ what they're, + what they'd ] been guilty of, and a lot of different things, I guess.	9
Yes <breathing>.	15
Not that they're risking their lives, of course, but risking a lot, {F uh, }	9
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
or one of, whatever the type name is, H M O, {F uh, } [ where the, + {F uh, } where ] you go to the doctor  and it only costs you ten dollars  and the insurance picks up the rest. If you tried to buy something like that, [  I'm prob-, + it would probably ] be five or six hundred dollars a month for just the cost of something.	24
{C and } basically [ it, +  right now [ it, +  it's ] ] fully trained	24
{C And, } -	26
Yeah.	15
<Laughter>  # That's what I think. #	36
Uh-huh.	15
maybe division one  right now.	24
{C But } what was happening at T I is that they found certain parts of the company there was a lot of drug abuse.    {F Um, } <breathing> mainly the areas [ whe-, +  where ] they were doing  a lot of, {F um, } manufacturing type things	24
{C but } that's so much fun to watch because [ they're, + they're  ] pure amateurs, {D you know, } and there's no money involved.	9
Bye-bye.	38
Yeah,	36
{C and } she was out in two days time.	24
# Uh-huh.  #	15
Oh.	15
# Where's it all going? #	36
{C but } they're not in public school yet.	24
{D Well, } maybe because it's outside of Dallas they are giving a little bit better prices,	9
Uh-huh.	15
bye-bye.	38
that's all you can do --	9
They're all, {D you know, } going,	24
I think they're, -	26
{F Um, } uh-huh.	15
# That's good. #	21
it did.	24
Yeah.	15
the one thing, -	26
Yeah.	15
# Yeah. #	15
we're, -	26
[ I don't, + I don't ]  let that bother me,	24
Yeah.	15
That's right,	36
That said anything that is a Skutzhund, [ a, + a ] Tervurien and, {F uh, } [ Alsatian + {A that's the other one. } Alsatian, ] any inner breeding of that can be called a German shepherd here.	24
Yeah,	4
[ {E I mean, } + {E I mean } ] Saddam Hussein lost so much money during the war that it was ridiculous	9
{C So } it's trying to push the weight plus have all this drain on it from all sorts of belts and things.	9
okay,	26
I watch it every now and  then.	24
No,	33
Yeah.	15
I took, {F uh, } Cammy to a <noise>, {F oh, } -	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } yeah.	36
{C But } they were still very heavy and philosophical, also very funny.	24
Southern California's still pretty large.	9
yeah.	36
Uh-huh.	15
We have got about, {F uh, } [ twenty, + I'd say about twenty-four ] hundred.	24
no,	32
{C But, } [ we've, + {F uh, } we've ] done, {F uh, } many types of camping.	24
[ There's, + {F um, } there're  ] two different size lakes about, {D well, } five, six miles from State College.	34
{C and, } {D you know, } [ [ you'd feed it, + you'd feed it, ] +  you [ put, + feed ] him ] small mice to big rats and things like that --	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C so, } {F um, } [ being, + being ] home is real, -	26
Okay.	15
{D well, } I had some of that problem,	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } the schools down here rate, {D you know, } bottom ten percent across the country	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
{C And, } -	26
yeah,	36
{C and } it's late at night.	9
[ {C so } when would go, +  {C and } we would go ] to Port Aransas or then,  on down to Corpus or further,	24
okay.	36
{F Uh, }	15
instead # of wallpaper.	24
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
I aim, -	24
{C and so }  they,  {D you know, } -	26
Hi.	6
{F Um, } I put it on [ the frame, +   the quilting frame. ]	24
{C and } I noticed all that grass coming up,	24
One is bad enough <laughter>.	9
I think it's, um, some place in New York because they're having budget problems, they're closing the libraries.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } {F uh, } [ we, + we ]  do a lot of canoeing when we go camping --	24
[ I, + I ] guess I kind of miss having a baby around <laughter>. A kid around or something <laughter>.	24
Ri-, -	15
Those guys kill each other out there.	9
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] [ that's a, + that's, is a ] reasonable start	9
okay,	29
The city workers, they wanted to, {F um, } -	26
[ {C And, } + {C and ] } how does your husband respond to all the new, social, {F uh, } changes?	39
I know,	36
Yeah	15
Yeah.	15
it is just really so sad because you can't enjoy anything any more.	9
[ we +  ((   ))  they ]  called us at five	24
-- {C so, } {F uh, } {C but } [ I, + I ] just like the Giants.	24
{C And } I do, {F uh, } about sixty,  {F uh, } bicycle, [ type, + {F uh, } leg thrust type ] things.	24
Got to see Pike's Peak.	18
{C and, } [ They, +  they ] get their names [ in the, +    in the ] paper	24
{C and } you really don't want the garbage in your house,	24
{C and }  it's about one by one and a half foot wide and long.	24
{C but } there is an Arlington,	24
Certainly,	11
{D Well, } I don't know <laughter>.	19
[ I'm, + I'm  ] up here for a year on an internship.	24
Yeah,	15
I think [ that's, + that's ]  a real important aspect	9
and I moved.	24
these kids are just in a day care center all day -- -- and, {F uh, } with [ no, +  any ] type of emotional, {D you know, } [ getting love, + getting care, ]	24
one thing that's wrong with schools is that we're not teaching to the children's modalities,	9
Right?	23
# {C And } [ I, + #  maybe we'll ] meet up again.	38
Yeah,	36
Right.	11
{C and } they say you've overextended [ your, + your ] conversation.	24
Linda Lee.	24
# {C So, }  yeah.	15
[ I, + if I  ] have a minute that's what [ I, + I ] do.	24
{C So } the, -	26
{E I mean } that's a hell of a lot time to be  sitting in front of the tube.	9
something else was made out of old tires,	17
{C And, }  {F um, } {D you know } he, {F um, } got a green  card [ is, +  and is ] in good standing in America and China, but only because he was always ((   ))  nice to the Chinese government, and all that,	24
{D Well, } I think the ones now with all of the, {F uh, } fancy gold lettering -- -- and all, {D you know, } I think they're very pretty.	9
Uh-huh.	15
# {C And } that, # -	26
smell the continuous, -	26
<lipsmack> if [ it was real-, + it looked really ] dangerous then I would wear boots	24
Okay,	13
[ # {C and } + # {C so }  ] something, -	26
# Uh-huh. #	15
# That's # -- -- one thing they don't do [ is, + is ] drug testing  while you're on the job.	24
the youngest is three.	24
[  It seemed re-, + it seemed real, ]	9
Uh-huh.	15
I do too.	36
{C but, } {F uh, } [ most of it, + most of it's ] in pretty good shape.	24
{C And, } -	26
{F uh, } [ {C and, } + {C and } ] my kids were there,	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
{F Oh } really.	15
Let's see,	17
# {C but } you # figure you got some drug guy out  there that's got an Uzi machine gun,  {F uh, } a thirty-eight, {F uh, }	9
<Laughter>.	20
doesn't that sound stupid.	8
Yeah,	15
{C and, }  {F uh, } I applied for one set of jobs with a company here in Dallas that they had two hundred openings	24
I really like the city Wausau in Wisconsin.	24
Do you work at T I?	7
{C And } the only reason why I may know a little bit about this, is that I'm planning on having a barbecue pretty soon.	24
{C and } here you are living ...	9
# {C but } at the # -- -- time, I worked there because my hours and days were the same as theirs --	24
I use H O M A.	24
{C And } they do,	24
{C and } it's only a little bit,	9
when I was getting robbed down in Florida, I was really considering electrifying doors -- -- # <Noise> {F um, } # things like that # like # --	24
[ I, + I ] think there's a lot of people that don't vote because they don't really think [ their, + their, ] {F uh, } opinion is going to be heard	9
{D You know, } neglect to cleanup.	24
{C So, } that gives you, {D you know, } lots of exercise.	9
{F Oh, } yes.	36
How many times have you called, by the way?	7
You can sit in the sun all day around the pool,	24
{C and, }  {F oh, } it was just disgusting	9
Yeah.	4
{C and } she picked up the phone	24
{C Because } [ I think, + I think ] we're just getting taxed way too much.	9
It's, {F uh, } -	26
# {F Oh } gosh. #	21
{D Well, } hopefully [ once they have, + {F uh, } {D you know, } once they've ] checked them off the list -	26
Yep,	4
{F Uh, } how do you feel about it?	31
{C And } we had a really wonderful arrangement, {F uh, }	24
{C and, } {F uh, } it had thunder and lightning,	24
[ This, + it ] would be nice if more communities could get really involved in recycling <breathing>.	9
{C so } [ there's, + there's ]  an established lawn and whatnot, flower beds, things like that,	24
Yeah.	15
[ I went to school at, + {F uh, } {D well } I went to school at ] West Virginia University,	38
I don't think, don't rent to them <laughter>.	9
That empty nest syndrome is going to set in, I guess.	9
<Laughter>.	20
{F Um, } me either.	24
{D You know, } I'm always afraid [ of + <laughter> <breathing> I'm ] going to need some and where will it be.	24
I guess there are  people that do that.	24
{C And } yet men have been dying from prostate cancer for years.	24
Nice talking to you.	38
Is it on, {F uh, } one of the lakes?	7
Gosh,	21
Yeah. <breathing> {D Well } I can underst- -	15
Uh-huh.	15
our favorite is something called  (( white half runner green beans )) ,	24
{F Uh, } {C but } maybe standardizing [ on, + on ] [ a, + a ] four year term for Congress -- -- Senate  and [ the, + the ] Presidency and then, {F uh, } staggering them so that you don't, -	9
{C But } I try to get one that's nice and  clean	24
Yeah,	15
Yeah.	15
I  remember that,	24
{C and } I know this only because from personal experience that I'm speaking of this,	24
{C and } I saw my stomach going down well.	24
[ E-, +  even ] if it is,  {D you know, } a company policy of, {F uh, } immediate termination or whatever, they still have to replace them.	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
Yes.	15
{F uh, } {F uh, } not quite,	24
Yeah,	13
{F Um, } I was working with an organization that does Bible translation.	24
{F Uh, } <inhaling> [ that's been, +  I've been ] pretty successful with that.	24
I listen to some country and western	24
I think it's pretty exciting that they can, {F uh, } -	9
{C But, }  if you can find a centrally located place where everybody would have to come about the same distance,	24
{C And } presently we have quite a few frequent flyer miles --	24
{F Huh. }	15
{E I mean } my mother does not work	24
Huh-uh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C so } we are going to be starting a regular payroll deduction -- -- in the fall	24
Just, -	26
-- {C so } he wasn't bad.	9
{C and } I think if we can get away from that, or if we can keep that out of our minds, <sneezing> {F oh, } -	9
can you tell much difference between the local radio, T V stations?	7
{D well, } we need to have another one.	24
{C but } I said -- -- maybe we might have to get us  an economy car to pull along -- -- when we went somewhere.	24
[ It's, + it's, ] -	26
thank you <laughter>.	13
I would assume that <laughter> {D you know, } whatever doctors are willing to do the paperwork and send it in.	9
What, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
Really?	12
I could not believe he did that,	24
I think that's a little bit   [ [ mor-, + more ] east, + further east,  ]  [ and + and ] maybe south, if I am remembering where that is.	9
<Sniffing>.	20
Stuff that I like,	17
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] in North C-, -	26
-- yeah,	36
{C And } we are going to consider ourselves against, in war, against these people as well.	25
So do we.	24
# {D Well, } do you know, # -	7
{C and, } {F uh, } she sends him to the principal's office,	24
Sure.	15
Uh-huh.	15
A thousand  dollars for this, {F uh, } {F oh, } magnetic, {F uh, } resonance imaging type thing.	24
-- {C so } I have to disguise it,	24
-- {C and } our son and daughter are both married	24
{C but } there was [ [ a, + a, ] + a ] big push with the local T V stations to have little hot lines with counselors -- -- [ to, + to ] help parents learn how to talk about their war with their children.	24
{C And } I thought that, {D you know, }  that's [ pretty si-, +  a pretty significantly ] small number.	9
yeah.	15
No.	33
Uh-huh.	15
{C Because }  {D you know } there's just, -	26
You probably, {F uh, } more up on this subject than I am,	9
Right.	15
yeah,	26
yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } we just had the tour championship here in Pine Hurst.	24
[ I s-, +  I saw ]  one of those episodes on P B S.	24
Okay.	29
{C but } it just became such a pain.	24
Mitzi.	30
Uh-huh.	15
the sentence of life without possibility of parole, {F uh, } has become a common one, and  is [ being, + being  ] used much more.	9
{D so. } -	26
{C and } they are not  too happy about that now, <<very faint>> I guess,	9
{F Um, } [ I would never, +  I would never ]  have a problem with anyone testing me,	24
it seems like that,	9
Right.	15
{D Well, } I was just wondering if you had had any experience with, {F um, } the care of the elderly.	8
uh-huh.	15
{C but } I only just put them out this week	24
we have part siding -- -- [ on, + on ] the two story part and then -- -- on the back,	24
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] they had to bite the bullet for that.	9
She loved them like they were hers	24
{D you know. }  I don't have any, {D you know, } love lost for people who are on the public dole just because they're too lazy to get a job or that kind of stuff.	24
{F Uh, } we usually take family type vacations.	24
By the way when you # say most people think it is,	24
-- is it one you're renting or buying?	7
{F Uh, } {C and } I find ways [ to, + to ]  turn some of that back [ to, + to ] others.	24
it was nice talking to you, also.	38
I like to quilt,	24
{C so } we're pretty far away.	24
Right.	15
one  time, we wanted to buy [ a truck, +  a used truck, ]	24
yeah.	36
{C So } that's nice, so you always get two days  at Christmas.	24
When I do, {F um, } crochet, it's usually the lacy Victorian type -- -- things like that,	24
{F Oh, } really?	12
Uh-huh.	15
I don't know what it's, {F uh, } by you.	8
{F Um. }	15
# Yeah. #	15
{D Well } {D see, } [ that, + that ] is the spirit of the sixties.	9
{C and } I have traveled most of my life	24
Nobody can get along peacefully <laughter>.	9
It's hard to say though.	19
<Noise>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
You do,	36
Yeah,	4
{C And } [  it was, + it was ] kind of, -	26
{F Oh, } yeah,	36
That I started when I was a little girl,	24
{C But } I always enjoyed watching them,	24
he wouldn't go howl,	24
that's a thought,	21
-- {C and, } {F uh, } he told me that there're a [ lot of, + {F uh, } lot of ] counts against the Canadian system, which is basically the one people are talking about for here.	24
[ Doesn't this, + doesn't this ] encourage, # {F Uh, } # # More  ((   )) . #	7
{D Well, } I guess we'll get pretty good news coverage  in a couple of years when you host the, {F uh, } summer olympics <laughter>.	8
{C but } Hebert Laws   a flute player,	24
{F Uh, } {D you know, } [ they're a, + they're a  ] department store.	24
I enjoyed talking to you.	38
They won't put up with that.	9
I don't know what I'd really do if it did.	24
in fact, [ I've, +  I've ]  played golf [ on, +  on, ] {F uh, } New Year's Day one year.	24
See!	13
I can go out and do it again and, {D you know } -- -- have the same thing happen.	25
I'm at home.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I'm sure, # -	26
{C and } if they didn't have a way [ to, + {F uh, } to ] fight back <laughter> they would have been in big trouble.	9
<Laughter>.	20
[ [ {C And, } + {C and, } ] + {F um, } {C but } ] some of the people that make a great deal of money and everything  [ I wish that they would, + {A I guess, because I'm not one of them <laughter>, } I wish that they would, ] {D you know, } realize that [ they, + they ] couldn't make this kind of money,	9
{F Oh, } that's neat.	21
In defense of myself, defense of my family or defense of my friends I can blow somebody a way in a heart beat. [  Even, + even ] more so when it comes to [ my, +  my ] wife and son.	24
{C and } [ the, + probably the  ] [ bigge-, + biggest  ] problem down there is  [ that's where the, + that's  ] the drug entry points,	9
{C so. } # -	26
I think [ we need, + we definitely need ]  more of it, definitely.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{E I mean } lunch today was eighteen dollars.	24
I'm not sure,	19
I don't know.	19
yeah.	36
I read about two or three novels a week, in addition to all the technical stuff.	24
{C but } you have a nineteen, -	26
{C And } you, sir,	38
Uh-huh.	15
-- {C and } I had four brothers and never messed with any type of guns --	24
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C but } ] it was just, -	26
Yeah.	15
okay,	38
you got any hobbies that you want to talk about?	7
# You can actually, # -	26
{C But } the T I rec center has an aerobics program [ for, + for, ]  {F um, } prenatal and  postnatal aerobic type thing.	24
[ speaking of Bush, +  {A we're going to get a little off topic  but } speaking of Bush, ]   [ they +  that ] had a story where he went to visit some little, {F uh, } elementary  school students, and stuff.	24
Uh-huh.	15
uh-huh.	15
That's probably true.	40
Yeah,	15
I kept hanging up on them for days, until my husband told me what it was <laughter>.	24
Uh-huh.	15
heavy involvement from the public.	24
the subject [ is, + is ] big city crime, which is something that I don't have any first hand experiences about,	24
they're more of a football team than they are basketball team.	9
# {C but } # I took a drive up through there, as a matter of fact, last September, just took the drive through to see what was there.	24
{C But, } -	26
Is that what you're saying?	7
{C so. } -	26
{C because, } {D you know, }  as I say, I'm sitting there fussing and fussing,	24
{C but } you won't find me dealing in drugs,	9
{C And, } that, -	26
{C and } <laughter> we just have a hoot playing hide  and seek when it's dark -- -- in our house,	24
{C But } [ we're, +  we're ] kind of looking around and wanting to move into a bigger home -- -- {F uh, } hoping to be able to do that within a year or so --	24
<<Very faint>> {F Oh, } <sniffing> all right <sniffing>.	29
<Static> <Children> {D So, }  how do you feel about capital punishment?	31
there's supposed to be something more healthy about it <laughter>.	24
{C and } we've done really well with them.	24
{E I mean, } pretty much a lot of people  would know about it, {D you know, }  [ and, +  and ] know some of the different things about it	24
{F Oh } no,	33
Yeah.	26
Yeah.	15
I talked to one,	24
[ {C but, } +  {F uh, } {C but } ] [ it, + it's ] worked out [ for, + for ] my family, to have my cake and eat it too, kind of thing.	24
{C and } no-, -	26
just if you've got a broadcast spreader -- -- I think it comes in a forty-pound bag,	24
{C and } I've got a pretty small porch,	24
# Yeah. #	15
not at all.	24
that's Nevada to # California # -- -- I guess.	24
Uh-huh.	15
True.	36
It's just hard to make yourself go.	9
there's  six, seven, eight different kind of plastics	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C But } it's, {F uh } -- -	26
It's, -	26
{C and } [ that, + that ] was all well and good.	9
{F Uh, } mixed Purina, {F uh, }	24
-- {C because } [ she, + they ] get less alert,	9
I had [ pol-, + {D you know, } the required political  ] science class -- -- a couple of years ago.	24
Let's see,	17
# {D So, } # my husband and I love to go to the musicals when they come into town -- -- into Dallas.	24
{F Uh, } this is true.	36
You know, # the people have a right to know except about what it, about what concerns them.	9
{F Uh, } {D well } {D like, } one week she'll work  three days and I'll work two	24
{C and then, } she would  go to these, {F uh, } arts and crafts shows and sell her needlework.	24
{C but, } {F uh. } -	26
my  own feelings about, {F uh, } capital punishment  is I think it should be mandatory upon a third conviction felony.	9
-- {C so } it's like completely opposed.	24
{C but } further down the coast in Massachusetts they got hit pretty bad.	24
[ Do you, + do you ] think that should  be changed?	7
Tell me how yours works.	18
Now is your other, -	7
Yeah.	15
{C So } that's good.	24
# Right. #	15
{F uh, } <throat_clearing> I've changed my views [ over, + ] {F uh, } [ e-, + even ] within the last few years, {F uh, } to be honest.	24
I don't see [  the, +  the ] Panama Canal that hasn't had a whole lot of usefulness to us recently since it's [ not, + not ] really big enough to, {F uh, } accommodate [ the, + the ] shipping that it once did	9
they ruin, <laughter>, -	24
{C but } we support our schools here with property taxes.	24
Ron, we'll see you later.	38
Yeah.	15
{C and } you are just kind of going   Ugh.	9
I don't, -	36
I think I did know that,  I just forgot.	24
Yeah.	15
in fact, I'm taking my L S A T -s, {F um, }	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } I think, {F uh, }  a lot of it is selfishness.	9
{C And } she was in a nursing home for four or five years before she died.	24
I have friends that work in other companies that are just now adopting the policy, # [ and, + # and ] stuff,	24
# Oh. #	38
# That would be pretty good. #	9
Uh-huh.	15
[ [ Did, +  {F uh, } did, ] +   {D like, } did ] you go to Disneyland?	7
Exactly.	36
{F Oh, } absolutely	36
the most recent ones that I've seen are those two, GHOST and, {F uh, } DANCES WITH WOLVES,	24
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
it's just that, I didn't, -	24
We like to get out and walk,	24
{C and } there are a few in some of the more,  like in -	26
{C and } [ I could # -- + -- then I would ] be able to dress more business-like and things like that,	24
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } {F uh, } I guess [ what I,  +  what I ] saw most recently and luckily I saw it only a week ago <laughter> so I'd [ remember -- + -- remember ] it well was, {F uh, }  sort of light by comparison.	24
No.	33
{C And } these are not the brightest.	24
Right.	15
thanks,	38
{C or, } -	26
I still haven't figured out what the zero through six days which day is which yet	24
<Laughter>  Right,	15
{F Oh, } that's sad.	21
it doesn't sound real necessary in Texas.	22
I haven't been to many.	24
what are you going to do?	16
Yeah.	15
{C So, } {C but } I do not know that I have seen any of the, {F uh, } sequels to that.	24
[ [ it, + it ] makes   the, + {F uh, } it makes, {F uh, } a ] whip topping out of milk if you get the milk cold enough.	24
{D See, } I, -	26
-- {C and } it really, {F uh, } -	26
That snake used to watch our cat walk around.	24
Yeah,	36
My wife when she talked about the Middle East	24
{C and } [ I, + I'll ] use those if I need to run in and buy a dozen pair hose right quick -- -- or something like that,	24
Uh-huh,	15
Excuse me.	18
{C And } it seems to me <baby>  that [ it's, + it's ] not a totally bad idea,	9
[ we, + we ]  screwed up one time like that too.	24
{D well. } -	26
Yeah	15
# Uh-huh.  #	15
{C and } the other half are {D like } really not.	24
I know <<Voice in background>>.	36
Yeah,	15
We could still have a frost.	24
-- {C but, } once you get that  job with the university, you've got ten years of probation.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{E I mean, } I would never buy it	24
# {D Well, } [ [ I, + # I, ] + I ] think one of the big problems, -	9
Oh.	15
{C So, } [ in, + ] as to those types of interpretations, {F uh, } really made a difference in how one might interpret the Bible now, and what it's at.	9
{C and } we've had this many inches,	24
you just didn't have a car,	24
Okay,	29
{C And, } {F uh, } I've seen what it has done in other countries	24
same here.	38
Walk around.	2
it makes you wonder, what they need it for # all of a sudden here. {F Um, } #	9
Only give the scores.	24
I used to, {D you know. }	24
Uh-huh.	36
Breakfast and run.	24
Yeah.	15
with teaching, {F um, } -	24
{C and } I think it's good that they're trying to start some programs down in the elementary schools.	24
Right?	23
Right.	15
Oh.	15
That would be good because we have two trash pick ups a week --	24
{C or, } -	26
Yeah.	36
{C so } I don't really know what the cost of living is even {D like } in Dallas anymore.	24
{F Um, } {C so, } {F um, } {D well } do you think Atlanta's as bad as most other cities?	7
No,	26
Yeah,	4
Madonna -- -- she's pretty trashy.	9
{D Well }  [ there's, + there, ]  {F uh, } -	26
{D You know, } I want to feel like I at least tried.	24
<Laughter>.	20
Everybody feels like we should be able to beat them	9
Yeah.	15
[ I don't have any, + {F um, } <lipsmack> [ I don't, + {D you know, } I don't ] use an ] awful lot of city services.	24
[ It's + it's ] not a problem either way.	9
Uh-huh.	15
[ I haven't, + I have + ] seen it, I think, maybe once.	24
When [ you, + {E I mean, } you've ]  heard [ the, + the ] slogan,  {F um, } if you outlaw guns then only out laws will have guns.	8
Uh-huh.	15
{F Um, } was it, -	7
{D So } what was the verdict,	39
uh-huh.	36
They [ ga-, +  add ] it [ on +  on ]  to tires and gasoline, cigarettes, liquor.	24
Bye-bye.	38
{D Well, } very good,	21
<Laughter>.	20
{C But, }   {E I mean, } I never felt any safer there than I did in any other city -- -- I have been in, {D you know. }	24
I know that day will come,	24
Yeah,	15
{C And } you know they do Ted Kennedy.	24
{D You know, } [ we, + we've ] got folks running around here [ who get, + who get ] degrees in basket weaving and -- -- {D you know, } underwater psychology, # or # [ some, + some ] ridiculous stuff # like that. #	9
-- {D you know, } {C and } if I want to drool or if I want to see how the other half is living -- -- {D you know, } then [ I can, + I  ] look through them --	24
Right,	15
Uh-huh.	15
{F oh, } boy,	21
{C And then } they had a child	24
no,	32
<Laughter>.	20
my son's in a performance tonight,	24
It is.	36
# I think Magic does a, # -	9
you're lucky.	21
I've had one idea that I think [ [ is, + is, ] + is ] completely undoable,	9
Are the-, -	26
I think, {F uh, } [ m-, + <<pause>> in my ]  situation, -	24
{C and } the one that's accused was the one that actually did it.	24
# Yeah.	4
# {F Oh, } is that true? #	7
{C and }  it's going to be a difficult transition.	9
I'm not sure it was that great for my children,	24
{C But, } I was more  in the late seven-, -	24
Right,	15
Uh-huh <<very faint>>.	15
[ in, + {F uh } -- -- in ] Snowbird and Solitude [ and -- + -- and ] Brighton and {D yes, } all those areas.	24
enjoyed it Bob.	38
Yeah,	36
-- {C and } it would be very hard for me because [ I wouldn't have, + I wouldn't have ] any idea how much money I was spending # in one month. #	24
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } yeah?	12
{F um, } it doesn't really have to matter,	9
-- {D you know, } {C and } it's two big cities that I think of as somewhat comparable.	24
{C And } I think they've been sort of hard nosed about the entire thing.	9
Right.	15
{C because } I was an only child too.	24
{C And } I think that's wrong,	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C but, } -	26
<Noise> {F Huh. }  Uh-huh.	15
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] someone, could come to their house.	24
# {D Well, } {F uh, } {F uh, } smoking and # all that stuff?	7
{C and } now they've messed that up to where it really is a financial burden to have to pay it.	9
It's just a matter of passing the law,	9
<Throat_clearing>.	20
<Laughter>  Did that help you understand a lot what was going on  [ your, + your ] prior experience with the military did,	7
I wouldn't, -	26
gosh.	21
{D like } we had some job offers in the New York area,	24
{E I mean, } I think they like to have healthy stuff too,	9
I think it maybe has [ to do  with a lo-, + a lot to do with  ] education	9
-- {F uh. }	26
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] [ I, + I ] [ mo-, + was ] very fortunate in starting,	24
Yeah,	15
Would be interesting wouldn't it?	7
I always have my head with a magazine somewhere as we -- -- drive or wherever we, -	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C So } it has the ability to do just  about any type of sewing you want to do.	22
it almost makes me feel, in a way, like making drugs legalized just to get all the money out of it and not have, {D you know, } -	24
{C but } we've gone, overboard to, {F uh, } protect persons from  [ being, + having ] their civil rights, violated to the point where the person that is damaged, is not protected.	9
{C Or } I returned it #	24
Thank you.	38
{C And } when you've got candidates as you do. -	9
{C And } I said, {D well, } I mailed you a check	24
# Yeah. #	15
[ {C so, } + {C so, } ] [ I, + {F uh, } {F uh, } we ] have thought very seriously of trying to, {F uh, } incorporate travel into and writing a book about, {F uh, } some portion of travel, {F uh, }	24
{C so } of course I'm a real Seahawks fan --	24
Uh-huh.	15
What?	14
Uh-huh.	15
I've noticed that too,	24
{D you know, } {D you know } you don't, -	26
{C because } there's everything in it.	24
Who knows,	16
[ I, + I ] have never lived here,	24
I got into all kinds of trouble doing that <laughter>.	24
Yeah.	15
the kids brought him over and said he was injured	24
{E I mean, } it's part of the Great Plains.	24
the court systems are too lenient.	9
[ That's, + that's ] great.	21
{C and } she was a lot more comfortable,	24
One of the frustrating things about that is that you really are limited --	9
[ I, + I ] have [ a, + a ] couple.	24
{C and } I need to go see it.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } I have to agree with that.	36
That's right.	36
{C But, } {F uh, } I think it's fantastic.	9
{F Um. } That's true	26
Absolutely.	36
AIDS has more money than, {F uh, } breast cancer <breathing> <whistling>.	24
{F Um. }	26
Yeah,	15
{C and } I watch so little T V, I did not even know what the deal was with this, {F uh, } {F oh, } -	24
Yeah	36
[ I, + I ] sometimes think that it's almost frantic effort on the part of the people in the city.	9
Yeah <laughter>.	15
I've seen quite a few of the older ones.	24
{C or } which, -	26
If uprisings [ hap-, + happen ] in their sectors, [ it is, + it's ] going to be a total blood bath.	9
{C and } -- -- they talk about it [ [ as a, + {D you know, } as, ] + as ] better for the country and  better for the working conditions.	24
in fact my mom's out there in Texas right now, in Dallas, spending a month with her cousins, on their ranch,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	29
{F Uh, } bye.	38
Uh-huh,	15
{D Well, } actually I do have quite a few more credit cards than you have <laughter>.	24
{D you know, } [ in the, + in the back, ] -	26
{C So } I stayed home with them	24
-- {C but. } -	26
<Laughter>.	20
{C but } when we were looking we were looking for something that had enough seat belts, of course,	24
{F Oh, } wow.	21
Yeah.	4
I do not know what they wanted honestly <laughter>.	24
Yeah.	4
but they would usually give me like five dollars more #at the end of the night.#	24
-- instead of a scholar you get a T A --	24
I know it,	9
Yeah,	36
{F Oh, } I know,	36
{C So } I don't know who's the victim there.	24
No,	26
and, in a way, -	26
Als-, -	26
good job.	21
Yeah.	15
the police, [ I think, + I don't think ] [ can do it, + can do it ] alone,  {D you know. }	9
{F Oh, } this is kind of tough.	17
Are you listening to him?	7
I'm not sure.	24
it's just, -	26
the same thing.	24
no,	36
{C and } [ he, + they ]  said that he was twelve years old,	24
It's just a shame that's the way it has to be.	9
Yeah,	15
Oh.	15
Says he, -	24
Yeah.	15
{C so } # you can just, {F oh, } -	26
{D Now } I understand that, {F um, } [ the, +  the ]  real estate market out there has really gone crazy, up and down, up and down.	8
# Uh-huh. #	15
{E I mean, } you hear these horror stories of people, homeless people going to the hospital [ and, + # and # being thrown out because they have no insurance, # and # having to go to someplace else.	9
-- {C and } I buy [ in, + in ] Austin, Texas, -	24
Right.	15
{C and, } if you want to send {D like, } {D you know, } fifty cents a day, or something like that -	24
{F Uh } Gene He-, -	26
[ {C and } + {C and } ] it's very handy doing it on the computer.	24
You don't feel as though you have much of a choice,	9
I think here [ if they, + {F uh, } instead of just, {D you know, } requiring that you [ put, + put ] out the trash and stuff, if they ] could get some kind of rebate, those people who do put the stuff out, {F uh, } {D you know, } and separate it, have lower collection fee or something # may # -- -- encourage -- -- people to separate.	9
{C and } I also play a little bit of saxophone, flute and piano -- -- when I get the opportunity, which isn't very often.	24
{F Uh, } {F uh, } however, [ [ I, + I do, ] + I do ] like a lot of different forms of music	24
if you're doing that sort of thing it's really useful,	9
The guy said it'd been on the lot about thirty minutes.	24
{E I mean, } {F uh, } -	26
a friend of mine makes it where she goes ahead and seasons up [ the, +  with the ] soup and the wine --	24
I don't know that that would be a good  environment to work in.	9
{F Uh, } it says a lot about,    {F uh, } {F uh, } {D you know, } -	9
I  know.	15
Oh. Uh-huh,	15
{C And, } {F um, } {C so } mostly, {D you know, }  we're not even to the point where we're getting into flowers, and flower beds or even gardens,  that, we're just saying, let's get some grass <laughter>.	24
{C so. } -	26
I'm so disgusted with the Democratic party,	24
Huh.	15
yeah,	36
Yeah.	36
They always appear to hold well.	9
<TV> [ Do you all, + do you ]  get together with family reunions	7
{D well } [ I could, + I could ] see if a kid doesn't have any encouragement if, [ t-, + they're, ] {D you know, } come from a broken home  and they're parents are more concerned about trying to work   *[[sp:their]]	9
{C and } you have parents that are really interested in the children,	9
{C and } that's  working rather well.	9
{C So, } {F uh, } {D you know, }  I got my degree and got the better paying job,	24
{D well, } I've never  been in the situation of itemizing anyhow.	24
Uh-huh.	15
the other two cats I have are outdoor cats.	24
{F Uh, } I had had an A F S student from Germany live with us our senior year --	24
did you not press one?	7
{D Well, } I'm  a nurse here	24
{C and } [ they're +  <breathing>, they're ] just like, {D you know, } someone  from the country lost in the big city,	9
I enjoyed having a lawn service	24
I feel that a company that can provide good health benefits such as health care, dental and vision -- -- as well as good long-term and short-term disability plans, {F uh, } goes a long way toward satisfying my needs.	9
It, -	26
{C or } they really made it hard to hunt them.	24
it is.	36
{C And so, } [ we, + we,  ] take it seriously.	24
uh-huh	15
I'm sure she is.	9
sounds too good.	21
# {C but } I # iron our clothes as we go along,	24
{C And, }  {F uh, } my oldest one just wasn't impressed at all with the idea of a small school.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yes.	15
Uh-huh.	15
[ {C So, } + {C and } ] I really do wish I knew about quotas and really wish I -	24
{F Oh, } {F uh, } I was tested, {F uh, } within my company.	24
# {C And } it's # twice a week?	8
{C So, } -	26
What club do you follow?	39
{C So. } -	26
{C so } we like seafood, too.	24
{C but } it's still nice.	24
<laughter> <<pause>>,	20
A C D C <laughter>.	30
{C And, } {D you know, } in those those kinds of situations, {F uh, } room rent which is outrageous. -	9
right.	15
I'm Bill from Raleigh.	24
{C cause } I do [ al-, + almost ] all my own maintenance # and, {F uh } # -- -- those types of things.	24
I always wait for the movie.	24
-- {C so, } [  I don't, + we don't ] go there that much.	24
all right <laughter>.  #	29
made it all the way through four years of college playing ball,	24
{C but, } {F uh, } they're getting too thick,	24
<laughter>.  Also I lived in Georgia for about four years,	24
{C so } -- -- I guess we'll, <inhaling> -	26
The last time I went, {F uh, } bass fishing,	24
yeah,	36
We seem to start dinner around six and finish it up.	24
{F Oh, } okay.	29
My wife, {F uh, } on the other hand is home most of the day	24
{D Well } it's been nice talking to you.	38
The older ones it's not,	9
[ I didn't, +  I didn't ] have much knowledge.	24
Oh.	15
our policies and procedures manual, {F uh, } the furthest it goes about drugs is in [ the, + kind of the ] miscellaneous section, or -- -- it's reasons for immediate dismissal,	24
Um.	15
Yeah.	15
The sanitary landfill, I think, {F uh, } is, {D you know, } running out.	24
{C so } [ I, + I ] just keep running the thing.   Don't want to sell it or  get rid of it until it quits,	24
{C So } you'll be cool all year around,	9
right.	15
we had this, uh, sixty-five Oldsmobile	24
{D Well, } that's good.	21
Oh.	15
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Exactly <<pause>>	36
{C so } I know what they've said.	24
{D see } [ the, + the ] thing is, {D like } here [ they just, + they just ] give you {D like } local news, okay.	24
sure.	15
I guess that is your standard knitting, isn't it?	7
yeah.	36
[ {C and, } + {F um, } {C but } ] to me five wasn't even a lot, because I was just so used to twelve.	24
<Laughter> Yeah,	15
I only live about a mile from where I go to school and work,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
That's cheaper than we pay.	24
{C but } there has been, -	26
{C and so } [ the, + the ] beaches here just get really beat up <<pause>>	24
That'd be just as dangerous.	9
{C And } I think that's a shame.	9
{F Uh, } [ I, + I ] would cheerfully live there.	24
{D You know, } [ we've got, + {F uh, } we've got ] quite a few domestic problems [ that, + {F uh, } that ] I feel we ought to be concentrating more on.	9
Uh-huh,	15
{C so, } yeah,	26
{C But }  [ [ that's, + {F uh, } the-, ] + they're, ] so close,	9
No.	36
<Noise>.	20
[ I <clicking> do it, + {D you know, } I can't do it ] at work.	24
My husband is really good,	24
{C And } the people that are really doing their job are paying for everybody else. {D You know, }	24
Huh-uh.	15
{C but } for me it was wonderful <laughter>.	24
Yeah.	15
Have you ever been there?	7
[ I think, + I think ] a lot of society is suffering.	24
that's  (( how these things sort ))  of make it for one person as an experiment	24
{F Oh, } we haven't seen that one yet.	24
they do.	36
{C but } now it's mainly evenings.	24
they'd say, all right, what did you see on WHAT'S NEW,	24
cars become very simple # all # -- -- of a sudden too.	9
Do you?	7
Improve it if we can, if we ever get a chance.	9
Do you watch L A LAW?	7
We have about four concerts per year indoors -- -- and two or three that we play outside.	24
perhaps they never had children	9
Yeah.	15
-- {C but, } {D you know, } people have picked up on it.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, }  nursing homes to me, -	26
If you know what to look for.	13
[ I've, + I've ] heard that,	24
there's little, {F uh, } nets you can use to catch fish to use as feeder fish and things like that. Minnow nets or something.	24
# {C And, } # {F uh, } my grandmother, [ his, + his ] wife -- -- {F uh, } we also put her in a rest home.	24
Right.	15
# Uh-huh. #	15
{F Uh, } you take a hospital, {F uh, }  the physical plant itself,	9
{C But } that's a huge difference just between --	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C so, } {F uh, } {F uh, } [ the, + ] ten years ago I was working in the medical center,  {F uh, } publishing a journal and  writing about medical topics <laughter>.	24
Those are nice.	9
Yeah.	15
[ I like, + I like ] the Garth Brooks album a lot.	24
Uh-huh,	15
Uh-huh.	15
It must be the, {F uh, } -	24
# She loves # lots of windows.	24
you have a southern accent,	9
[ {C and, } + {C but } ] now we've seen, {D you know, } <breathing> {F uh, } black people have a lot more civil rights in that area and I guess all over than they did, {D you know, } twenty years ago.	24
He loves to cook it	24
The what?	14
That kind of builds some -- -- character a little bit.	9
I was just thinking about one the other day.	24
Right.	15
Uh-huh,	15
I haven't seen them on much  T V that much at all,	24
{F Oh, } they do.	36
Uh-huh.	15
Right.	15
I can't really watch television if the pattern is very intricate.	24
{C because } he's always had a garden out in the country.	24
[ [  I, + I, ] + I ] hope that we, {F uh, } {F uh, } get a chance to, {F uh, } promote peace out there, {F uh, } because I think without peace we're not going to get stable oil prices,	9
I -- -- really like it <<very faint>>.	24
I don't know,	19
Yeah,	15
{F oh, } yeah.	15
{C and } they were thrown forward, into the front seat,	24
Go ahead.	18
it's like sticking, {F uh, } an electrode  into their pleasure center	9
I can't remember the name of the county	24
{F Oh, } right, <laughter>,	11
Th-, -	26
# Bye. #	38
I don't think women look good with muscles.	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
that was limited  to five or six different places	24
they'll even take things that are bound.	24
{D Well, } that's good.	21
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
# Okay.	38
Course [ I have, +  I have ] a dog also.	24
{D You know, } as far as boarding planes and driving cars and calling on customers.	24
{C And } now the Red Lobster I found is very nice at lunchtime.	9
Yeah.	36
{F Oh, } uh-huh.	15
I guess, -	26
# {C and } # I, -	26
{C But } we do spend time driving in the  mountains,	24
I guess [ our, + we're ] in the process of a home repair right at this point	24
[ They've, + {F uh, } they've ] had longer hunting seasons than that even to get rid of more of them, because they were, {F uh, } increasing so much.	24
# [ So-, + sounds  ] sort of like the incredible journey. #	24
# <Laughter>. #	20
Right.	36
{C and } [ there, + there, ] they, -	26
They go what's that?  This track which it's going around  the world	24
Is that right?	7
# {D You # know } you, # turn # on the T V, turn on the radio. -	24
Don't watch really very many horror films at all.	24
Yeah.	15
[ I, + I ] think that's about all I can, -	38
Right.	15
Okay.	29
Uh-huh,	15
{C And, }  {F uh, } I [ have, + particularly enjoy ] the English comedies, and the English mysteries.	24
is that for T I	7
I think my wife is much better than I am at that walking into a place and getting a feeling for <throat_clearing> whether it is a loving and caring place or not	24
{C and } I used to live in Colorado, {F oh, } sometime ago for a couple of years,	24
You feel like you're in the minority?	7
you probably don't know po-, -	9
Yeah.	15
[ It's not, + it's probably not ] the best <child_talking>	24
{F Um, } I'm in college,	24
That's where I kind of get into, -	9
Yeah,	36
Right.	15
<Laughter> Yeah,	36
I just got real good and toned.	24
A woman was raped in Richardson,  I read in the paper {F oh, } about a two weeks ago now.	24
{D So, }  <lipsmack> {D well, } shall we wrap it up?	7
<lipsmack> I'd be -	26
{F Oh, } sweet <laughter>.	21
Uh, you know, whatever -	24
{C so, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
-- {C and, } {D you know, } we shouldn't, -	26
There's always a few of those people that [ are, + ] {D you know, } lost their head or  whatever.	9
{D Boy, } it sounds like you're really into it.	22
I'm not too great at it	24
{C or } # did you do that yourself? #	35
{C and } it's like,  {D well, } {D you know, } I use to feel like, -	24
I'm not from here,	24
Uh-huh.	15
To have them, {F uh, } -	26
I said,  but you're only going to put the cast on for a couple of weeks.	24
{F Um. }  If they did, they'd still have  to pay his contract <laughter>.	24
{C and } he drags me out every now and then	24
# Yeah. #	15
uh-huh.	15
{C but } I saw [ a, + a ] presentation [ on, + on ] that	24
our whole house is baseball fans --	24
She said that,	24
{C and } yeah.	15
Right,	36
No,	33
{C and } I know that the S A T scores for our admitting freshmen are higher than [ a lot of the public sch-, + a lot of the private schools. ]	24
{C and } they don't care,	9
We rarely go in there, except for to play chess.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	4
It's frozen -- -- in the first -- -- place, right?	7
-- {C but } you have to have a very good sense of saving, [ and + or ] -- -- common sense [ not, + not ] to -- -- get yourself in trouble.	9
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah.	15
<Noise>.	20
Okay.	13
# I # think they underestimate [ how much, + how much ] value the satisfaction -	9
It was really nice that they had, {F um, } that -	24
{F Oh, } my gosh.	21
It was -- -- in home child care.	24
{C and, } that's a bad word <laughter>.	9
{C and so, } {D you know, } I'm,  hear [ the, +  the ] rock music, not the hard rock, but the, {D you know, } Michael Bolton type stuff.	24
it's real challenging,	24
you just told me that you're going to get one of those guns anyway.	9
{C and } the parking brake is a piston deal.	24
is that not true?	7
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } they just really believe in Allah, or God, or whatever.	24
{D actually } [ I, + I ] grew up water skiing.	24
{D Well, } it depends on what rank you are, #  of course <barking>. #	3
-- {D you know? }  I'm not saying innocent person,	24
{C because, } -	26
{F Oh, } yeah,	15
{F Oh, } good.	21
I think that maybe [ [ if, + if, ] + if ] some of those people had gotten exposed to the community, gotten exposed to working with other people that some of the things that they did they would not have done	9
{C so, } {F uh, } I lived in Kansas  City for a couple years	24
uh, like I said, most of the people at, at this company don't wear suits.	24
do you have children?	7
{C So, } [ I, + I ] hope it helps.	24
you got Four Oh One K plans.	9
Pretty scary.	9
{C and, }  {F um, } it's not the biggest either.	24
{E I mean, } {D you know, } they're not even having to serve out what they should be serving.	9
Ve-, -	26
{C And } it'd be refreshing once in  a while to hear some good news.	9
[ {C and, } + {C and } ]  you'll find that that's the other big thing that has changed in terms of, # {F um, } # women don't feel like they need to  get married anymore.	24
# Exactly. #	36
{D Well, } {D you know, } [ you, + you ] back the winners	9
That I didn't ever understand.	24
Sure.	15
<laughter>, everybody was getting stuck in the mud.	24
Yeah,	15
If you agree that, {F uh, } -	24
{F Uh, } that's true,	21
Uh-huh.	15
He'd come out to the kitchen, just kind of look at me until I went and  got him something out of the refrigerator.	24
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh,	15
Sure,	36
#  {D Well, }  even if you did, that's okay actually.	24
it is true, {F uh, } {D you know, }	9
he did this,	25
Yeah.	15
{C but } there's awful lot of money in time and  effort spent in preparing for trial only to  then finally get scared enough by going to the court	9
Yeah.	38
{C and } traveling from, {D like, } Dallas to Austin to San Antonio it's the same thing as far as the pollution created by the automobiles [ in the, + in the ]  stalled traffic and the busy highways, [ [ you, + you, ] + you're ] at your best	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ My, + {F uh, }  <lipsmack> my  ] sister, -	26
Yeah.	15
That's a good seafood place.	24
{D well, } let us see.	17
{C But } I think, {D you know, } that there is a lot in the society where things have changed,	9
that's fun.	21
{D Well, } good luck.	38
a couple of weeks ago we were cooler than normal,	9
seems like you could set the score at a hundred -- -- and then give them five minutes to play,	9
yeah,	15
That's right.	36
That's the way it goes, I guess.	21
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh,	15
{C and } I brought her to a different vet this time	24
{C and, }  {F uh, } we've got about, -	26
Yeah,	36
{C because } on one hand you have, {D you know, } that [ the, + {D you know, } the, ] Soviet Government, of course, mistreating a lot of the, {F uh, } Slovak countries  and  then, on the other hand, you have, {D well, } -	9
{F Oh, } I didn't realize that.	24
I'm not a member of the N R A although my, father is.	24
-- {C and } [ Mike, and, they had been, + my two sons had been  ] a passenger in a car about a year and a half before that, which was hit by another car.	24
I thought, -	26
-- [ {C and, } + {C and ] } they just don't understand that you still have to be able to make the payments.	24
I said, Then mine counts, because you could cancel mine too.	24
Yeah,	15
Yeah.	36
{C And } I do think, {F um, } the schools, -	9
Yes.	36
[ I, + I  ] really hear that, {D you know, }	24
{F Uh, } Virginia.	24
I think it would.	11
{C And } they got us in trouble,	24
I'll have to keep that in mind <laughter>.	37
Who knows,	16
That is what I did with my plants.	24
well, you know, -	26
Yeah,	4
{C And then } when you get one of those tornado type -- -- systems through or severe hail or thunderstorms -	26
But see, by that, I think sometimes it's a little late.	9
Yeah.	15
It was really good.	24
Yes,	4
{D Well, } I know that when you're in a  smaller community, -	9
Look at this  (( they ))  sent me this money, {D you know. }	25
I feel a little more worldly now <laughter>.	24
he will.	36
# {F Um. }  #	26
Uh-huh.	15
Have you rented any movies lately?	7
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh } really.	12
{C but, } {F uh, } [ I, + I, ] couldn't [ eve-, + even ] -	26
{D Well, } it is probably not going to be done  because I have not heard from them.	24
It seems like, {F uh, } there's, -	26
{C and } in your,  ((   ))  the luck of keeping them alive, through those first, {D you know, } few # days. # -	9
Also I said we mostly did ours before we started a family.	24
He got locked in the school	24
<laughter> We don't really [ have, + {F uh, } {D you know, } entertain ] too much.	24
I couldn't even think of what you call them.	24
{C But } they're real, -	26
{D Well, } isn't that neat.	21
{C so. } No big deal.	24
{D Probab-, } <sigh> I'd say five or six.	24
# It is, # -	26
{E I mean, } {D you know, } why only, -	26
it's terrible.	9
<Laughter> My community,	15
{C But, } {F uh, } this last one had a fair  sized root	24
{C so } [ [ I'm, + {D well } I'm, ] +  I'm ] still learning how,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
(( {D well } )) , that's me too.	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ It's, + {F uh, } I ] would hate to have to wrestle with that problem.	24
Yeah.	15
Has it gotten better?	7
Uh-huh.	15
{D you know, } there's camping and fishing and hiking and wildlife watching	24
And cover his ears.	22
Yeah,	36
we went to,  (( I've forgotten )) , one of the paint stores	24
{C and } I know they're dying everyday,	9
{C so. } -	26
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C So } where have you been?	39
{F Huh. }	15
{C and } that's one thing that impressed me so much is no matter what size yard somebody had, they had a beautiful garden in it.	24
right.	15
{C and } I never really, -	26
Soda,	2
{C but, } -	26
# {C And } [ people who, + people who ] have them and are responsible with them [ are, + are, ] are being punished	9
{F Um. }	26
{C and so } since he had this friend up from Houston, {F uh, } and his friend had already seen so many and I thought they decided on this and I thought {D well, } I want to see this one, too.	24
Make it difficult enough.	2
{F Um. }	15
{C And, }  {F uh, } it kind of makes  me listen a little closer [ to, +  to ] the piano when I hear it at other places, or when I, {D you know, }  [ see some, +  see and hear ] someone playing.	24
{D Well, } -	15
{D you know, } it's, -	26
<laughter>,	20
{C and, } that's something my stepfather never could teach me, {D you know, } just to relax and hit the ball,	24
-- {C but } the other side of it, to me, -	26
<Sniffing>.	20
{F Uh, } {F uh, }	15
Yeah.	4
{C so } [ you go, + [ if you're, if you're ] not doing any kind of sport thing you go ] to one of your sisters' or brothers' -- -- sporting events. And sort of {D like } be there with them.	7
{D like } they live up in Sherman.	24
{C and then } I went out two weeks ago with the guys here.	24
{D well, } I've always  had big dogs before.   Never had a little dog before.	24
{C And then } there's other ones that, {F uh, } deal with, {F uh, } in a funny manner, {F uh, } socially relevant things.	9
no,	33
-- {C and, } {F uh, } -	26
Curly hair	24
{C And } I just quit too <laughter>.	24
Oh!	15
That's true.	36
# [ I'm not, + I don't ] # eat enchiladas.	24
I finally get to the green	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } if your door comes open, {D you know, } it's not going to do you any good.	9
{C or } you come down to the end of the year	9
Do you have anybody that you, {F uh, } are close to that decision on, or  anything,	7
Exactly.	36
{F Um } I  guess my initial view is our tax burden hasn't gone down in recent years [ despite, our total tax burden, + despite tax cuts  ] --	9
{C and } that's why jury selection is often very difficult.  # {F Uh. } #	9
<Laughter>.	20
{D Well, } {F uh, } that's about  all I can think to talk about right now.	24
Okay <laughter>.	29
were they close?	7
Yes.	36
{C and } [ it, + of course, it  ] scared the women to death, {D you know, }	24
Uh-huh.	15
# Right. #	15
He's admissions director.	24
Okay.	36
{C but, } -	26
Yeah.	15
no,	33
{C But, } {F uh, } I might start to go crazy with it too.	24
{C And } there's some that, {D like } the different colors denotes [ how much they, + how much the tension ] I guess they are and how easy they are to move.	24
Why did you do it that way <laughter>.	16
I don't know,	19
{F Oh, } it's not bad at all.	27
{C and so } she has a lot of school programs and things like that.	24
{C But, }  {F uh, } {D well } I got my thirty day notice yesterday.	24
Right,	36
Uh-huh.	15
We all went to high school together	24
all that stuff, {F huh. }	23
Yeah,	36
{D well, } when I bought my car, it was right  out of college	24
{F Uh, } {F oh } yeah,	4
Oh.	15
He used to play for the New York Giants.	24
{F oh } I have a dog,	24
{C and, } {D you know, } they're just real shallow people.	9
Yeah,	36
{F Oh, } definitely.	21
no,	33
I imagine if I go and sharpen them myself, {F uh, } they won't last <throat_clearing>.	9
{C and } [ one, +  one ] of the kindest people I've  ever met in my whole life, {F um, } is from that area of the country	24
<Laughter>  {D Well, } -	26
The  judges do the questioning	24
{C So } we thought maybe we  could get them to move a little closer here.	24
no,	33
we come up here in the summer,	24
{C And } [ it, + {F uh, } it's ] pretty good.	24
{F Oh, } my.	21
What type of home do you have in Dallas?	39
{F Oh, } what are their names?	39
My wife will write  a check for groceries	24
[ The Gramm, + # the Gramm ] Rudman Act.	24
almost every day was cloudy	24
no,	33
# That's right. #	36
<Laughter>.	20
{D so, }    *[[slash error]] Yeah,	26
# You don't get # any newspapers?	7
We've had no major problems with it.	24
{C and, } -	26
{E I mean, } I couldn't believe that she couldn't think of any place.	24
it is.	36
Yeah,	36
Where you from?	39
Yeah.	15
{C so. } That's pretty weird.	9
the next morning you want to take them out,	24
I don't know what I said to him	24
[ {C and, } + {C and } ]  a lot of my boys, {F uh, } my older boys' junior high friends will come over.	24
[ I can, + I can ] understand that.	21
Sometimes they put a source light	24
{C and } they did not endorse, -	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
# <Laughter>.  #	20
[ I, + I ] was called once,	24
[ That, + I have that, ] too.	24
Are you calling from Texas, by the way?	7
I, I'd learned on an automatic transmission. And so, so I'd go out on dates where they would teach me how to drive this car.	24
{C and } you take the stuff out of your trunk,	24
{C but } we're only going to stay two weeks.	24
it's good to see them #  doing some things there anyway.	9
If you can get someone that you trust to buy one from <noise> -	9
Right,	15
They been trying these people now for twenty-two years, ever since I was a child.	24
Yeah.	15
<Laughter>  {D Well, } Taco Bueno's good <laughter>.	9
yeah.	36
{E I mean, } [ I, + I ] definitely think that it's the drug problem that needs to be addressed,	9
{C And, } {F uh, } the only problem was, when I opened the can, it just flew all over the place.	24
[ My, + {F uh, } our  ] cable doesn't,	24
[ she was, + she is ] always prepared,	24
It's nice to not have a drip through from the roof, isn't it <laughter>.	7
I guess also the fact that they say it's not a deterrent, -	9
I'm sure, I will do,	24
Yeah.	15
the library has a paper.	24
My [ does, mot-, + ] mother will be [ th-, + ] ninety this year	24
what did I read recently	1
{C And } the only thing I miss about  a Cadillac is, -	24
{E I mean, } I don't know whether I'd stay in prison or not	9
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } {F um, } there aren't men's gardening clubs in this area that I know of,	24
You use [ your, +  your ] company's?	8
{C and, } -	26
I understand, -	26
Oh!	15
We've gotten to the point where,  {D you know, } [ [ if, +  if, ] +  {D well, } if ] the racial make up of the group was such and such, {D you know, }  they'd have to do that percentage of work and what is perceived to be that part  of town and, {D you know, } That kind of thing.	9
Right.	15
Yeah.	36
Yeah,	15
<Laughter>.	20
after your children are grown.	24
(( It was )) , {F Oh, } twelve times, of the year.	24
{C and } our neighborhood is pretty much working class people, though I'm in graduate school, {F uh, }	24
{C and so } I try to take,  {D you know, } weekend papers,	24
do you know anything about Ruben Sierra's, # {F uh, } #	7
{C and } it's interesting.	24
Make sure it's a lot safer because a couple of people are going to be discriminated against unfairly or whatever.	9
Yeah,	15
{E I mean, } [ you, + you ] must back up and play some of the music twice.	8
Yeah.	15
{C and } the Cavaliers were playing somebody.	24
I <laughter> don't know.	19
<Laughter>.	20
{C And } I know, {F um, } our youth group goes over	24
{F Uh, } what, white wine?	7
This one was only forty-five dollars.	24
we do.	24
She played the clarinet	24
No.	33
I do.	24
I worked in, {F uh, } Missouri for a while	24
It could be, if [ they are af-, + they are not ]  sure of themselves.	9
Yeah,	15
# [ {C And, } + {C and ] } # most of the time they're looking to place blame.  # {F Uh } # -- -- and stuff.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh,	15
Right.	15
I think [ [ you, + you,  ] + you  ] balance the foods, {F uh, } {D you know, }	9
Yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } if you get two weeks off, you get two weeks off -- -- and you're not allowed two weeks and one day.	9
exactly, exactly	36
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
# {F Oh, } sure. #	36
<Laughter>  That's like World War Three every minute <laughter>.	9
{F Um, } I know, -	17
{C and } I'm sure you think of your children,	9
[ It's, + that's ]  really convenient to be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back	24
{C but, } {F uh } you don't eat it at all, {D you know. }	24
with the eastern half that's the Dominican Republic.	24
{D So, } sounds like you like to read.	22
He just get one more  ((   )) .	26
{F Oh, } I know.	21
{E I mean } it just # -- -- blew me away.	24
[ that was, +  it's ]  a really nice area,	24
{C And } I guess that's diversion.	24
{D Well, } that's, -	26
Sure,	36
-- {C and } that's about it,	24
I see. {F Uh } <throat_clearing>,	29
Yeah.	15
it seems like most people like spaghetti.	24
{C And, } {F um, } [ I have, + {F uh, } I sort of have  ] a sort {D like } -	24
[ {C and } + -- -- {D you know, } {C but } ] I guess if they, -	24
right,	36
<noise> you have to really have your car winterized and stuff, {F huh? }	7
{C and, } [ [ you, + you, ] + you ] don't feel like you're a half hour away if [ she + ] -- -- something happened. And, you're less preoccupied with it, I think.	9
I think eventually they're going to have to do it --	9
Oh.	15
{C So, } I've had this dog now [ for, + for ] sixteen years	24
I don't know, {F uh, }	19
Oh.	15
You never see them [ on  a, + on ] nationally basketball.	24
# Yeah. #	15
# Uh-huh <baby>.  #	15
They're nice I think.	9
{F oh, } I'm sure it is.	9
Yeah.	15
{C But, } {F um, } th-, -	26
{D Well, } -	3
--  {C and } it's kind of boring standing there, putting on makeup,  so I'll turn the radio on	24
Yeah.	15
{C and, } that, -	26
{C so. } -	26
I mean the do teachers get, -	26
It definitely -- -- has changed.	9
[ {C and, } + {C and } ]  the cost between them [ is very, +  is very ] little.	24
yeah	15
# Yeah.	15
{C And, } {F uh, } it's been in two, maybe three times.	24
I think we've covered our time.	9
it was, -	9
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
We usu-, -	26
If we paid them more, it would attract more [ the, + the ] higher educated people [ to, + to ] {C either } move into that field {C or } to continue in that field.	24
# Right. #	15
{C and } it was late at night and # scary {C and, } {D you know } <laughter>.	24
{C And } [ I, + I ] think one thing I don't like  about aerobics is that after I'm finished it's kind of late at night,	24
{C And } because of the defense cutbacks and all that kind of stuff.  And all the nuclear and stuff which is [ what he, + what he ] was working on.  He's getting cut back #	24
I don't have very many dress clothes	24
{F Oh, } yes.	36
Yeah	15
it always would, {F uh, } {F uh, } be more than what you paid for it	24
{C And, } {F uh, } because  [ [ [ they're, + {F uh, } they're, ] + they're, ] + {D you know, } they're ] documentaries and they're. -	24
{C But } it's just kind of like get on the  telephone	18
I'm not real sure about   th-, -	24
{C and } we knew what was going on, to, {F uh, } {D you know, } go downstairs or go into the [ bedro-, + bathroom ] and, {F uh, } take cover.	24
Yeah.	15
I'll tell you that.	17
Uh-huh.	4
[ {C And, } + {C but } ] that was just when I was a kid	24
That's true.	36
{C and } your defense attorney presents their evidence	24
{F Uh, } one parent.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
{C And } how'd that go?	31
That's absolutely right,	36
Do you?	12
{C And } they're going to Washington, D. C. next December <lipsmack>.  {F Uh, } to sing for President Bush at the White House at Christmas time.	24
{D Well, } there's a, -	26
{D well } they make mistakes too, I guess.	9
{C So } if I'm in a mall or something I can't get cash out without paying extra money	24
{F Oh, } I haven't heard anything about it.	5
{C and, }   we just do all kinds of fun things like that	24
{C So, } I was just wandering if that was what it was or something.	24
{C But } {D anyway, } {F um, } [ I really, + I ] don't work outside of school.	24
<Throat_clearing> Yeah,	15
{E I mean, } it's free parking	24
Yeah.	15
{C but } if he's a space cadet and doesn't watch the children, and be aware of what the safety hazards are, -	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } [ the other one, + {D well, } the other one, ] I don't know what her age is,	24
Yeah.	15
{C but } I know there are some fields where it's really not necessary.	24
that would be the intent of it.	9
That's great.	21
those are over a million.	9
{D well, } we live in [ north Tex-, + north Dallas ] which is [ like a suburb, + near a suburb ]  called Plano.	24
Yeah.	15
Yeltsin's in tight with the old guard.	9
I use, {F uh, } {F uh, } the black iron  skillet to cook mine.	24
yeah,	15
{C and } they come out	24
# I don't, you know.#	19
It fluffs up,	24
{C and } I think it was {D like } on one of  [ the, +  the ] documentary T V shows where they ask for [ the, +  the ] verdict by the jury --	9
{C and, } {F uh, } you have teachers that want to teach,	9
Yeah.	15
{C And } one things that they're saying, now, -	24
I said <<pause>> didn't <laughter>.	24
we were at a beach site, too.	24
{C And } I was thinking, {D you know, } cruise I am thinking.	24
{C so. } -	26
the, -	26
Okay.	29
{D Well, } I like the food,	24
Is there anybody who doesn't?	7
# He does somewhat. #	34
Right,	36
It was really interesting.	9
That's the only reason I work there, is that my children now have [ graduated, + [ and + ] graduated ] from college	24
I have done a little bit of that,	24
{C But, } {F um, } <lipsmack> mostly I read, -	24
it has.	24
[ [ {C and } I've, +  {C and } I've, ] +  I've ] lived in [ that, +  that ] environment for quite a few years  when I was doing construction work.	24
{C but, } {F uh, } yeah.	26
Yeah,	36
Right,	15
{C and } that's it.	24
Right.	15
Oh.	15
I've had this for a couple weeks	24
I have a real thing about being hot [ in the, + in the ] summertime.	24
yeah,	36
It does have to be really hot, {D you know, } when you  put it in.	24
We used to camp a lot with our -	24
She makes things for the kids for Christmas and  nephews and nieces	24
{C And } that's what's really paying for my time unemployed or  whatever. Because [ the graduate assistantship really doesn't cover, + the ten thousand dollars in tuition, really doesn't cover ] living expenses.  {F Um, }	24
I # -- -- didn't think that was any good #	24
{C And, }  {F uh, } I'm sure you have a lot of students there, {F uh, }  and a lot of researchers	9
{F Oh, } okay,	29
<Laughter> That's right,	36
# Yeah. #	15
it kind of gets -- -- it off their chest.	2
{C but } we didn't know it,	9
four hundred hours,	24
{C But } it does remind us that we have family and roots.	24
[  We, + we ] had the same type of situation.	24
{C But, }  {F um, }  [ those  law-, + those lawns ] look nice during the winter,	24
-- {C and } the parking brake failed.	24
it is	36
{C So, }  did people come {D like } from out of town to the reunion	8
With all that smoke and, -	24
Uh-huh,	15
Then they have a blue one the same size for the paper goods.	24
{C and } [ they, +  they ] live there	24
{F Uh, } particularly when you try to, -	26
he would, {D you know, } laugh with the kids and play with the kids	24
you never know.	9
Uh-huh.	15
What kinds of, {F uh, } sweat shirts and T shirts do you make?	39
That's right.	36
{F Uh, } I haven't gotten through <laughter> it yet.	5
{D Well, } what kind of music do you like?	31
# <Laughter> # That's true.	36
of course it does.	25
{C but } it really hasn't rained <laughter>.	2
-- every year.	24
#  No,	26
{C and, } {F um, } up here [ we have, +  {F uh, }  we have ] quite a few mosquitoes at nighttime.	24
yeah,	15
Yeah,	4
<Laughter> Yeah,	36
{C and then } we went to Disney.	24
Yeah,	15
{C and } # I've # -- -- been doing a lot of bike riding outside with the nice weather we've been having	24
Uh-huh.	15
# yeah	26
{F Oh, } I've seen, {F uh, } <lipsmack> previews for them <laughter> on T V,	24
<Laughter> Yeah,	15
{F Oh, } yeah,	21
That's great,	21
{F Um. }	15
I think maybe last year was the first time in like eighteen years or  something like that, that [ anyone + -- -- anyone ] from Pennsylvania had gotten it.	9
[ {C and } then, +  {C and } ] changing gears at stop lights and stuff is really getting on my nerves now.	24
I don't know how to explain it,	17
{C But, } {F uh, } the expenses right now for health care, {F um, } are just unreal.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
the kids are so wonderful <laughter>.	24
{C But } so many times you  get, {D well, } {F uh, } this is my opinion of what he meant by that,	24
I really have to be in the mood.	24
Goodness.	21
{D Well, } we have this philosophy,  we use it when we go off somewhere	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh <<very faint>>.	15
#<laughter>.#	20
[Children] Well, what do you think, <noise> {water running}	39
basically, [ I just, + {D you know, } I wear ] slacks year round except [ every, + ] about once a week I try to wear a skirt.	24
# they are great. #	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } [ it, + it ] looks good,	9
{D Well, } [ it, + it ] got all screwed up because I had a high deductible on the health insurance, no fault here,	24
I like the Boston Red Sox myself.	24
# The kids # keep those <laughter>.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } how it serves us given the extraordinarily large sum of money the government  has to operate with.	9
that's -- -- interesting.	21
[ {F Oh, }  that's, + # {F oh, } that's  ] important.	21
They're kind of rare.	24
-- {C but } [ {D like, } + {D like } ] when I'm down at home --	26
<breathing>	20
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
[ Ye-, + yeah, ]	36
# Really.  #	36
because when I was in Los Angeles for a time, it's all, you know, from Los Angeles to San Diego it's like all city.	9
are you on an exercise program now	7
[ I have, + I have ] a son that just turned sixteen,	24
it is a problem.	9
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
# That's right.  #	21
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } that sounds good.	21
{D Well, } I still, -	26
Okay,	29
{C but, }  {F uh, } [ this, + this ] was actually inner city --	24
{D You know. } -	7
that's interesting [ the, +  the ] [ way, +  term ]  you used continentals, which I'm sure is the proper term.	9
{C but } [ it just, +  it ] was a tremendous amount of cooking <throat_clearing>.	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C And } you would have because they do all kinds of, {F uh, } gardening and not just flowers like women do.	24
[ I've, + we've ]  seen that two or three times.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah	15
that's true.	36
[ It's, + it's ] just like any of the other national parks.	24
no,	33
Uh-huh.	15
All done by yourself, {F huh? }	7
I know, {D well, } new cars aren't cheap  anyway, <laughter>	9
{C and } the one time that we went, we got one,	24
{C And then } we go back for four years.	24
{D Well, } [ that's, + that's ] good.	21
{C and, } {D you know, } you get all prepared	24
Maybe a people are a little [ o-, + ]  more open-minded than maybe they used to be.	9
<noise> {F Huh. }	26
{C So } if the person  is not in the right mind, {E I mean } they had to, {F uh, } <lipsmack> put her away.	24
Yeah,	15
{C And } maybe they should be a little more,  {F uh, } {F uh, } concerned with paying the right people to teach [ and, + and ]  be, {F uh, } satisfied with maybe a little older school.	9
{C So, } I don't know,	19
they have everything from lawn work, lawyers, news, {F uh, } veterinarians, all kinds of items, {F uh,  }	24
Yeah.	15
{D So, } have you eaten crawfish yet?	7
Right.	15
I'm on it,	24
<Talking>.   *[[slash error]] # Uh-huh. #   *[[slash error should be 'b']]	20
<Laughter>.	20
I bought a tape,	24
{C But, }  I do, {F uh, } quite a bit of wreath making	24
# Yeah. #	15
-- {F uh, } I don't always succeed at that.	24
{C and } I kind of made the pattern up.	24
we had  ((   ))  summer lasting  long	24
{D Well, } # -	26
I think they'll always represent a threat [ wheth-, + whether ] or not there's an active cold war or not.  {F Uh, }	9
You probably could get really good feedback from a lot of other working mothers -- -- {D you know, } that have done this over and over again.	9
-- {C or, } you can both enjoy the same sport and participate in separate circles.	9
{D See, } {D well } I screwed myself up also,	24
{C because, } {F um, } we've had enough industry here, that, I guess it, -	9
my goodness, Diane, get down from there.	10
Uh-huh.	15
Is this better?	7
{C but } when you do that then it becomes almost, {F uh, } a  ((   )) , -	9
Yeah,	15
What brand is it?	39
Our lot in life is to make her life miserable	25
Uh-huh.	15
[ It is, + it is ] very, very nice.	24
{F Um, } I've got [ a, + a, ] {F uh, } small company on the side [ that I, + that I ] do things with,	24
It just seems so sad to have to only rely on, {D you know, } college football.	9
the whole family, then, was -- -- in on this?	7
I'm not near that age <laughter>.	24
Okay,	26
Yeah,	36
Sure.	15
Yeah.	15
our interest there is, {D you know, } what profit we could make off of any kind of relationship with them,	9
[ {C and, } + {C And } ] [ I've bought, + {D you know, } I've bought ] greeting cards that are made out of recycled paper,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } no,	32
<Cough>.	20
{C or } they sell their catalog list of people, # to # different companies and everything.	24
<Noise> <<it sounds as if speaker B is washing dishes>>.  {D Well } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] can spot a kid [ who really, + {D you know, } whose parents ] spend every, quality time with them, {D you know, } outside of the work day.	24
{D Well, } {F uh, } the hobbies that I pursue in my spare time, are crafts	24
{C and } I don't think there's a big advantage in going to the metric system.	9
Right,	15
{F Oh, } really?	12
{D Well } they say that walking is just as good if not better then jogging.	9
# Right.  #	15
motor homes can be a lot of fun.	9
{C because } my brother was supposed  to go to the opening game,	24
{C so. } # -	26
If you're ever interested in going the route, I dealt with this woman,	24
Yeah,	15
[ I never, + it was never ] my own car --	24
Yeah.	15
# No,	36
# Yes,	4
{C So } if you're out {D like } in a department store and there's a sale, you're just real careful not to let your urges get hold of you?	8
<Laughter>.	20
right.	36
that would cause  you think a little while, wouldn't it.	16
That's right.	36
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	4
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	15
They said, [ the, + apparently the ] crime, is, just, {F uh, } -	24
It really was,	24
Running water --	30
Huh-uh.	33
Uh-huh,	15
{D Well, } {D see } [ I, + I ] am debating whether or  not I want to go see the movie (( after having ))  read the book.	24
Yeah,	15
{C And } [ it's k-, + it's kind ] of scares me, not that I don't want them here and not that I don't appreciate the fact [ that, + {D you know, } that ] they have rights too.	9
{D Well } that sounds adventuresome # <laughter>. #	21
Something.	2
{D well } I don't either,	24
[ I, + I ] guess I am disappointed with Dallas in that, {F uh, } the fourteen one, it, -	24
right.	36
{C But } [ [ [ [ it's, + my, ] + my, ] + my ] wife  has a real job	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C But } [ in, + even in ]  our region there's an employment problem.	24
{F Uh, } quite a bit,	11
} my mama I remember her being home -- -- {F uh, } # {D you know, } # she made breakfast in the morning for us.	24
((   ))  the next morning they would  have them strung up across the (( getties ))  --	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and then } we use, {F uh, } different chemicals and things,	24
{C and, } -	26
{C and } they get away with it,	9
Okay.	38
{C And } he goes, human nature <laughter>.	24
{C But, } {F um, } we met in Paris.	24
{C and } when I got up there the car, -	38
really.	36
{D Well, } we like Arby's. As far as, fast food goes.	11
I really don't come from here <laughter> --	24
Oh <<faint>>.	29
{C but, } {F uh, } [ I still, + {F uh, } I ] am sort of a catfish man at heart.	24
Yeah,	15
{C and } there is, -	26
{C And } they had their little bags -- -- way back then,  and fill it up.	24
I think it's, {F uh, } a good idea.	9
{F Ooh, } this is a beneficial call.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Alright,	11
{F Uh, } near, {F uh, } Philadelphia.	24
He'd buy all the sound tracts he could get his hands on --    *[[typo tracks]] -- if he had the money to.	24
{D well } let's see,	17
I'm back on.	24
I wouldn't have to worry about it breaking down all the time <laughter>.	24
there you go,	21
{F Uh, } [ I, + I ] would almost just say that because, {D you know, } down here in the south -- -- {D you know, } a woman's role is, # a # woman's role, # sort # of thing,	24
{C and then } we actually held them back in fourth grade.	24
We have got about eight or twelve books for him, just little Bible stories.	24
{D Well, } [ I'm, + I'm ] glad I'm not the one [ that's, + that's ] in charge [ of, + of ] making those decisions.	24
Three or four times,	36
Huh?	14
not really.	5
Uh-huh.	15
[ That, + that ] is certainly true	36
Yeah.	15
{C and } their S A T scores are very low,	24
they made jokes about him {D like } on the CARSON SHOW and all of that,	24
{C and } that's when the movie was filmed,	24
we were made differently, # however you # come to that conclusion,	24
Set.	13
Oh.	15
I've participated probably in about maybe, I don't know, seven calls --	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C But, } {F uh, } yeah,	15
right.	15
{D Well } what are some of the other  features on this machine?	39
{D Well, } [ I think, +  thinking back, I think ]  the only style I hope doesn't come back is bell bottoms.	24
you must pay all attention to what you're doing.	9
I do, {F uh, } quite a bit of sailing.	24
{C And } you know how much you're going to drive every week?	7
I beat it {D like } every minute  for about ten seconds	24
{D Gee, } it's just so versatile,	24
{C But } she is scared to death of thunder storms.	24
<Laughter>.	20
They were fifty miles away	24
{F Uh, } let me see <laughter>.	17
<Laughter>.	20
doesn't it?	23
# That's right. #	21
no,	36
[ [ [ I'm + {F uh, } I, ] + I work for, ] + I'm ] an electronic technician.	24
{C And, }  {F um, } -	26
# You're expected to, -	36
It's, {D you know, } -	26
{C So } for instance, in, {F um, } the last presidential election, I'm sure a lot of people thought, {F Oh, } Bush is going to win either way,	24
It's going to have to be both.	9
{C and } I just -- -- # like it there. #	24
Yeah.	15
{F Uh, } last year when they passed the tax laws for the, {F uh, } nineteen ninety, ninety-one, whatever, nineteen ninety-one -- -- {F uh, } I added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and -- -- everything else,	24
Maybe I've, {F uh, } changed [ win-, + wiper ]  blades or something	24
{C and -- -- then } they would just send me a check for what was ever over that, {D you know. }	24
It's good to get use out of one.	9
{C So } for about [ twenty min-, + twenty, thirty minutes  ] a day we got a baby-sitter comes in.	24
{C but } when they sit down and look at what it costs to live -- -	9
I'm not a James Caan fan,	24
{F Oh, } okay.	29
I guess that could happen.	40
Yes,	15
{C and then, } {D you know, } it just kind of feeds itself.	9
Bye.	38
Uh-huh.	4
Yeah.	15
Okay.	30
{D Well, } we must get in the neighborhood  of anywhere from three to six calls about that time of night.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{E I mean, } [ goll-, +  how humiliating ] for a man to do that, any man.	9
{C and } you put your bottles in it and paper and,  {F uh, } {D you know, } all those things [ that wh-, + ]	24
{C So, } when we can go to a cabin as long as we've got running water -- -- I'm a little bit better off.	24
{D Well, } that's very true <laughter>.	36
-- {F uh, } (( )) somebody was knocking on my door here.	24
-- {C and } it's an eighty-five,	24
I, -	26
{C and } <swallowing> -- -- # maybe # that's [ why, + one of the reasons why ] crime has gone up, because it's not so scary anymore.	9
Yeah.	15
You know.	17
Okay.	38
He didn't die,	24
{D Well, } like I told you before,  ((   )) . -	24
Yeah.	15
{F Uh, } I know the institutions don't work that well,	24
Uh-huh.	15
No,	36
You know what it's like and how much work it takes to keep the house running smoothly,  and to take care of the kids.	9
How big is your band?	39
{C and } they said they looked down and there went -- -- Bud's boots	24
<Laughter> Right.	15
Not too # bad. {F Uh. } #	24
it's like if you have to do any statistical data it can be easily  represented [ on a, + on a ] P C.	24
[ m-, + ] yeah, <laughter>.	36
{E I mean, } -	26
# <Laughter>. #	20
debates would come up up there in Massachusetts and, you know, in that area over, uh, air pollution	24
{C And } I'll tell you what.	17
Supply and demand.	9
Yes,	15
{C So, } I'm just hoping [ that, + {D you know, } that ] we can get some cut out and  painted, {D you know, } before summer starts -- -- because we don't want to have garage sales or anything like that -- -- in the winter time, {D you know. }	24
You'd think it would carry mostly religious	9
That's right,	11
{D Well, } my wife's Toyota is soon to be four years old,	24
{C so, } {D you know, } [ I, + every once in a while I'll  ] put the cassette in and go with it.	24
There,  {D yeah, } -	26
((   )) , {F um, } pasta salad first,	24
{C so } that the silver will be predominate in the kittens.	24
-- {C but } they've got  a st-, -	26
from West Virginia	24
{C but } baseball is still -- -	24
Yeah.	15
# Sure does.	36
I do not think he was in combat,	9
{C and } I think, maybe, as you get outside the Dallas area,	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
{D Well } [ that, + that's  ] what ended up being the real problem on this, was [ [ the, + {F uh, } [ i-, + ] the,  ] +  the  ] pipe wasn't busted,	24
I do too.	36
{C but } it, {F uh, } -	26
what do you do?	16
{D Well, } I don't know, {F uh, }	19
# Uh-huh.  #	15
Like STAR TREK, they thought that was much too violent for small children.	24
{C but } <laughter>, -	26
Right.	15
Where do you live?	39
Oh.	15
<baby_crying> {C but } you get a lot of junk mail about them.	24
The news,	30
Yeah,  {F huh. }	15
# No. #	36
I didn't.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
What's that?	39
{C and, } {F uh, } we really didn't have things like that going on -- -- that we, {D you know, } {F uh, } ran into.	24
Yeah,	15
Now we have a eighteen year old that's fixing to get out of high school and go to college.	24
Yeah.	15
[ Wh-, + what's ] the old country music like?	39
Yeah.	15
{C but, } {F uh, } they're certainly not up to a standard of a K O A where it's, {D you know, } a little bit cleaner.	24
{F Oh } my gosh.	21
That's right <laughter>.	36
[ I, + I ] think so.	36
I haven't had anything,	24
#  ((   ))  push paper around. #	2
# Uh-huh. #	15
Yeah.	15
<Breathing>  {D Well, } the housing here in Maryland is just atrocious.  And  [ in, + in ] the entire D C area.	24
{C and } just seem like we were getting a lot of rain in March,	24
<Laughter> {D Well, } my degree was in fourth through seventh grade	24
Yeah	15
You still want to eat,	9
yes.	15
{C And, {F uh, } <swallowing> so } they cancelled that one and, {F uh, } are looking next year bringing it back closer,	24
{D well } at least you've got some <laughter>.	9
I see.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Exactly,	36
((   )) .	20
{D Well, } {F uh, } we're kind of lucky.	24
Uh-huh.	15
# Yeah,	15
I, {F uh, } consider myself a hacker.	24
Yeah,	15
{C and }  you could go for your lunch hour down and visit with your child, [ or, + ] {D you know, } and take your breaks with your  children, or something.	9
[ that's a, + that's a ] Pillsbury plant	24
I can see that it will be a very long time, probably, before I subscribe to any magazines at home.	24
Uh-huh.	15
I was trying to think, {F uh, } -	17
Uh-huh.	15
{F Um. }	15
Uh-huh,	15
Uh-huh.	15
Hondas have great resale value.	24
No,	33
Oh.	29
while they're east coast, {E I mean, } I don't  know anything about their football,	24
yeah.	15
{C But, } {F uh, } [ they, + they ] have done some testing around our office, mostly after lunch, looking for people [ drinking, + {F uh, } drinking ] beer and stuff at lunch time,	24
Uh-huh <child_talking>.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Absolutely.	36
If they could get away with it <laughter>.	2
I'm a trust officer --	24
{D well, } who is this,	39
Yeah.	4
Yeah.  {F Uh,	15
{C And } as I look back  now, now we're paying that back.	24
{C But } I did one wedding last year	24
Did you take kids along?	7
[ we, + we, ] consistently, -	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and then } it changed  hands and doubled the prices	24
[ It's kind of, + it's kind of ] been a drought out  there hasn't it, {F uh, }	7
That's true.	36
That's true.	9
Right.	15
they don't have a very deep, {F um, } o-, -	24
{D You know, } I was real embarrassed,	24
no	33
{C and } I [ swear, + swear ]  that game off for another year,	24
{C and } [ that, + that ] is a little troublesome. {F Uh, } because the pressures on them [ are, + are, ] [ rather, + rather ] formidable.	9
Kind of radical, I know	9
Yeah.	36
-- {C and } we have so many people in the United States that we spend, -	9
{F Uh, } my daughter talked to a student.	24
[ {C and } that's, + {C and } that's ]  great [ if they're con-, + if they're sentenced ] to death,	9
<Laughter>.   *[[slash error]] Yeah.   *[[slash error, should be 'b']]	20
{F Oh, } that's what I was curious about,	29
Yeah <<faint>>.	15
My [ a-, + accounting ] department will at the end of the month.	24
Yeah,	36
<<Faint>> I don't know.	19
Not one dime is deducted from his check.	24
I have two grandmothers still alive,	24
Right.	15
{C and } that's not just the driver and the passenger	24
Okay,	15
{E I mean, } I think everybody just lives under an umbrella, the uncertainty with housing -- -- and everything,	9
# I # don't follow actors.  <laughter>	24
{C And } one of them, they, were able to get running, {F uh, } kind of oiling it and playing with it	24
Yeah.	15
{C but, } {F uh, } went fishing with him on Friday and took, -	24
I was working at the Dallas site.	24
# I know a lot of # -- -	24
me being one person with a above the median income, for New York state, {D you know, } -	24
Right.	15
{C and } [ I, + I ] really like the system of house arrest where [ [ a, + a, ] + ] [ someone's wear, + someone wears ]  a bracelet -- -- like a ankle bracelet that's a monitor,	24
{F Uh, } that was the one with Mickey Rooney	24
{C and } [ we had the, + {F uh, } we both enjoy ]  mushroom soup	24
Uh?	14
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } having that mother there, that base, I think, was a big part [ of, + of ] family, a big part [ of, + of ] what, {D you know, } [ your, + your, ] {F uh, } youngsters thought about, what they did, {D you know. }	9
[ {C and, } +  {C and } ] I'm not sure  but what some of the insurance claims aren't due to, {F uh, } illnesses brought on by drug abuse or alcohol abuse.	9
It's also designed to line the pockets of lawyers.	9
{C and, } {F uh, } -	26
-- {C so, } {F uh, } [ [ we, + we ] kind of, + we kind of ] [ got, + got ] the ball rolling ourselves versus a bunch of top secret silly [ organi-, + {F uh, } {F um, } {F oh, } operations ] and then the [ full scale, + {D you know, } full scale ] troops, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.	24
I can't remember what she called it,	24
[ {C and } -- + -- {C and } ] we pay the same amount that someone over there that has four children has, {E I mean, } <laughter>	24
yeah,	26
[ {C and, } +  {C and  then } ] you see that their education is below the norm  throughout of all fifty states.	24
Yeah,	26
{F Uh, } {D you know, } it barely made it.	9
-- {C but } even then you didn't see them wearing slacks too much.	24
I never pay to see one more than once. {D You know. }	24
Right,	36
{C So } it's, involves a lot of spreadsheet use.	24
Bye-bye.	38
it just, -	26
{C and } I don't even know where I even put that paper <laughter>.	24
so does my husband,	24
{C And, }   {F um, } we just moved here two years ago	24
{F Oh, } okay,	29
which fortunately they replaced under warranty, because it was about a three hundred or three hundred and fifty dollar part --	24
Really,	15
{C But } they like to tell us that it's going to be important <laughter>.	9
Most of this area was developed, -	24
{E I mean, } I know how to fix a running toilet --	24
[ {C And } the first d-, + {C and } the first ] and only election he won was, {F uh, } the presidency <laughter>.	24
he says call this friend of mine at Will's Point.	24
{C and } I know the places,	24
{C but } [ I, + I ] don't think he really knew it was going to be as big as it was.	9
yeah.	15
You bet.	36
[ {C and, } +  {C and } ] [ he's just, +  he's ] wonderful.	9
Really.	12
Hi Norma.	6
Uh-huh.	15
{F Um. }	15
# Right <throat_clearing>. #	15
{F Uh, } [ I don't, + I don't ] know because the cats  pretty much, {F um, } -	9
{F uh, } # that is true. #	36
Yes --	36
Okay, {D well. }	13
Did you find you wore, {F uh, } slacks when you were working full time	7
{F Oh, } was it?	7
# {E I mean, } it's, -	26
{F Uh, }  {C and so } let me take the lead, {F uh, } Angela.	37
{C And } the baby was in his crib with the door shut just screaming his heart out,	24
[ Di-, + did ] we tend to, {F um, } change their [ attitu-, + attitudes ]	7
Haven't had any parakeets for quite a while,	24
Now I do work full-time.	24
<Laughter> {D Well, } I guess they will shortly.	9
Yeah,	15
uh, yeah.	4
{C but } he decided he was  going to go to [ the, + {F um } -- -- the ] smaller now, and then graduate school later.	24
# Hail and thunder and, # -	21
{F Oh, } I've never itemized yet.	24
{D Well, } I guess then, I will go,	18
{C and then } on weekends they go out and sell it	24
Right.	36
{D like } if we do watch T V at night, they just {D like } enjoy just, {D like } laying on top of me or something.	24
<Laughter>	20
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	36
Oh.	15
And possums, and, {F uh, } raccoons.	24
That was good.	9
[ {C And, } + {C and, then } ]  what happened was that Phil Collins said, hey I can make money, a lot of money doing this,	24
Okay.	13
Yeah.	15
-- {F uh, } [ I, + I ] like things that, {F uh, } [ are, + are ] wholesome, I guess.	24
And, uh, we were real happy with them,	24
Big jump there.	9
{C Cause } I know that skiing in Utah  [ is, + is ] suppose to be <static> great.	24
# {C And } I, -	26
that's true.	36
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	15
it was a change, {D you know, } from your traditional, normal, {D you know, } stuff,   [ and + ] since it was Christmas time [ and, +   and, ] {F uh, } we had the church decorated  with Christmas hollies and poinsettias and, {D you know, } stuff like that	24
I was just so surprised and amazed with the statement that they say only registered voters can be picked for jury selection.	24
Yeah.	15
yeah,	15
They want you to buy their car.	9
{F Uh, }   I don't know [ maybe, +  maybe ] if I went back and took a sociology class now they'd say it is a deterrent.	19
I don't know,	19
Uh-huh.	15
I haven't,	24
{C but, } {F um, } no,	15
I like MURPHY BROWN and DESIGNING WOMEN, too.	24
{F Oh, } terrible	21
{C but } {F uh, } she's, -	26
{C and } I probably get more exercise than your average person.	9
Uh-huh.	15
yeah. #	15
Uh-huh.	15
Did you really?	12
Really?	12
-- {F uh, } I know in my case, [ I, +  my wife and daughter ] were kidnapped, during a house robbery back in eighty-five --	24
Uh, you know, of course then when, when you're not recycling, you've got these incendiary plants and stuff, that can give you some pretty disgusting stuff going up in the atmosphere.	9
Yeah.	15
{C and } the other side was the patio and the backyard,	24
think he was in Virginia,	24
# Yeah. #	15
Uh-huh.	15
They've done a couple of little seed projects,	24
{C and } -- -- {C so, } {D yeah, }  I  (( would ))	24
{C but, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } you've got to deal with, {F uh, } taking care of them [ and, + and ]  feeding them and everything like that.	9
{F Uh,} {D you know,} when you were talking about maybe what kind of guns that would be hard to decide,	9
here in Plano we've got, {F uh, } quite a few.	24
we have burlap sacks,	24
{C and } I thought, I don't think I'd find that exciting <dishes>.	9
That's okay.	27
{D Well } any, {D you know, } TIME  magazine and even the news that, -	24
he [ ran her out, + was running ] [ to hi-, + ] in a wheelchair to hide her,	24
[ I, + I ] think that if they really tried,  they wouldn't have to. #	9
# Yeah. #	15
# Uh-huh. #	15
Huh-uh,	15
I run the whole show.	24
[ Port-, + is that # Portland? ] #	7
Right.	15
like you, -	26
{C but } [ you, + you ]  have to use it in combination with a sewing machine.	24
# I just got married.  #	24
bye-bye.	38
-- {C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } they had absolutely no regulations, no controls whatsoever,	24
I don't, -	24
{C But } all of a sudden, [ [ in, + in, ] + {F uh, } in ] [ [ October, + {F uh, } September, ] + October ] it got real hot and dry and just stayed that way for a long time.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	36
{D So } the only thing I would hate is if I were to go and, {F uh, } -	24
{C And } they were all more or less hospitalized type -- -- {D you know, } really, really sick.	24
{C but, } [ it, +  it ]  keeps us supported temporarily, # until # I can get a real salary and then get taxed more.	24
Wouldn't take it apart after that.	22
I'm around my kids	24
She said, You should have done pansies.	24
Yeah	15
{E I mean } -- -- as you're walking through that little tour in, {F uh, } Munich, it's kind of <laughter>, they're trying to brainwash you, too <laughter>.	24
[ [ I, + I, ] + {F uh, } I ] don't know,	19
{C But } anyhow, I, -	26
It's, -	26
Right.	15
I know,	9
{C or } do you think that,	35
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
Like you said I think society as a whole, {F uh, } you can't expect, {F uh, } -	9
<Laughter>  {F Uh, } maybe,	34
{C and } I haven't really seen much.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
{C and } they hold it  up to the sun God,	24
I think that's great.	9
{C But, }  {F uh, } {D well, } what was that show, {F um, } <barking>  [ Gar-, + {F uh, } Garf-, ] -	28
{F Oh, } I hate to hear that.	21
two family house where [ [ the, +  the, ] +   {F um, } the ] downstairs and the second floor they had, -	24
{C or, } # {D you know. } # -	26
Uh-huh.	15
Okay,	15
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah	15
I don't know about the judge making the decision, if that's, -	9
{D Well, } {F uh, } [ I usually, + I usually ] play at home.	24
that's true.	36
<Laughter> {C And } if it's cold, we say, okay, out you go.	24
thanks for that, {F uh, } reference.	42
[ It's like, + {A God, } [ it, + it ] seems like ] it's easier just to go out and buy it already # made <laughter>. #	9
{F Oh, } boy.	21
exactly.	36
{C and } yet it ended up not being anything particularly memorable,  because [ the, +  the ] story was stupid,  [ and, + and ] then  things like that,	9
He, lot, -	26
Fast food, {D well, } I can understand that.    *[[two utts]]	21
You can't find a trace of them because God totally destroyed  them for how wicked they were.	9
I heard about that.	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ there are a lot, + there are so many ] different songs,	24
Yes,	6
Right.	11
{C and } if I were to get married and have a family that would have to have something to do with it.	24
Tha-, -	26
{F Uh, } it said the seasons,	24
of course, we like to occasionally go out and get down and dirty with barbecue or  hamburgers <laughter> -- -- or something like that, too.	24
what [ he +  his ] concerns were -	24
{C but } just like with housing, {E I mean, } they're not doing anything about pollution,	9
{C so, } {D you know, } they're liable to be right.    That [ generals, + generals ] in the service, -	9
{C and, } -	26
It's nothing but woods [ up here, + # down here. ] #	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I've seen some of these elderly people on T V {D you know, } the ones from Florida that just run into people	24
Yes,	36
{D Well } the first time we did it, we just took some arbitrary amount  that we estimated it would be,	24
[ We, + we, ]  {D you know, } put, -	24
{C And } I see kids already that are going to be criminals -- -- in spite of everything we can do	24
Huh-uh.	15
{C but } also,  {F uh, } [ that, + that ] long term benefit of a little bit of tone in your muscles.	24
Right.	11
{C and } I think my parents always, {D you know, } did without  or saved up to, {D you know, } buy things	9
probably not,	5
{C and } [ the +  -- -- the ] ice maker [ was, + {F uh, } had ] to have a new pump,	24
One other benefit that you mentioned is the flexible work hours	24
{C but } I keep putting off learning.	24
But that, that will cut pollution too.	9
<Lipsmack> {C And so, } I'm not, -	26
{C and } she's going to buy her house,	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
<Laughter>.	20
I don't know.	34
{C And then } one of the things that we talked about with her was, {D you know, } the need to save for our son's education.	24
Yeah,	15
{D Well, } how about when you were in Colorado?	31
Uh-huh.	15
{C and, } {F uh, } I was on crutches,	24
It's probably costing you a fortune.	9
Yeah.	15
that's because [ it, + it ] can't tolerate a  freeze this early.	9
I think that's when [ you, + you ] start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have.	9
{D Well, } that's been a  (( con-, )) -	26
<Throat_clearing> {C But, } it's something that's really <inhaling> hard to deal with, the way that our justice system is right  now, <sigh> is basically set up in lawyers	9
I've talked to many, {F uh, } owners of places and say that nobody even, -	24
Yeah,	15
but, of course, uh, Richardson is in the Dallas area.	24
Exactly,	36
{C So } that's not too bad.	9
No,	15
Uh-huh.	15
# {E I mean, } prohibition certainly didn't last. #	24
He said I needed to pull every leave off the tree,	24
Yeah,	15
{C and so, } {D you know, } my oldest, he was,	24
{C but } it makes the room look smaller [ which is, + {F uh } -- -- {F uh, } which is,  ] -	24
{C And } {E I mean, }  that is one big thing down here.	24
I do.	24
{C and } I think another thing that was really nice was that our neighbors on the other side of us bought the lot right next to us.	24
{C and } their cats, {D you know, } their so used to the attention,   that if they don't get it, they get really upset,	24
[ {C So, } + {C so } ] you just sew everything up, huh?	7
# Exactly. #	36
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } {D you know, } that's exactly, {E I mean, } [ I'm, + I'm ] not saying [ I, + I ] think [ capital murder + {E or } capital punishment ] is the perfect solution in every case, {D you know, } especially because there are some cases when you just don't know	9
I agree,	36
{C But } if they were, {F uh, } playing the people that they're going to play, then that might be pretty good indication,	24
Thirty or younger, Is that what you said?	14
Okay.	36
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	36
<Laughter> {E I mean } you'd really want to <noise>,  really be liking your golf.	9
Right.	11
Yes,	4
{C but } here in Dallas [ it's, + ]  I think they all were planted by the classical Johnny Appleseed,  and Johnny Pecanseed, whatever you would call it, {D you know, }	9
I love Nolan Ryan.	24
Uh-huh.	15
I like to read stuff like that.	24
{D You know, } {C and } it's really   interesting to see how that affects people because essentially more and more people  in this country are not likely to revolt in the way that people used to think  [ of, + of ] the voter revolting.	9
Right.	15
Usually just get dumped out with the trash.	24
{C and, }  {F uh, } we need the one extra room.	24
{F Uh, } {D well, } then [ [ you, + you, ] + you ] know why they make them then <laughter>, that way.	9
we went last summer, actually.	24
Yeah.	15
{C So } [ if, + {D you know, } if ] we want to drive, we pay our own insurance,	24
I never did see the full story,	24
-- I teach in a school about eight  thousand,	24
<Breathing> <laughter> Oh.	15
apparently they've been so [ in, + ] {D well } I don't know inbred, or what,	24
Uh-huh,	15
{D Well } what is this going to do the insurance  companies who are supporting this work now and hopefully are doing, {F uh, } a good job?	39
{C and } that was, {F um, } # {F uh, } [ scallops, + # {F uh, } scallop, ] {F um, } -	24
I thought it was kind of maybe for kids more, than ad-, -	24
Right,	36
{C so } you ought to be saving up some every month to make up for all what they should be taking out.	9
great.	21
# {D You know } # -- -- that's something I miss quite a bit.	24
It's maybe the size of two or three, {F um, } grocery bags.	24
{C So } it's really, -	26
she came back that, {F uh, } -	24
Back when I was going to school <throat_clearing> {F uh, } you just didn't get away with the things these kids get away with now.	24
# Yeah. #	15
Do I consider them a threat?	7
{C but, }  {F uh, } # [ I'm # a big, + I'm a big ] baseball fan	24
{C But, }  they had, -	26
{C but }  they got motivated in college	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
{C and } when  we came up, here, {F uh, } to California, {F uh, } we're in the Monterrey area,	24
{C And, } {F uh, } <lipsmack> there's this one kind of cheese that you can put on the end of a hook	24
-- {C and, } {F uh, } {C so } [ that's, + that's ]  one thing that's good.	24
{D You know, } {C so } you really have no choice that way [ if you, + {D you know, } if you're ] not rich [ or s-, + ] {D you know. }	9
{C and } -- -- every day that she's not at school, {F uh, } she thinks we need to have someone over and play --	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
That's the only thing I've ever done also, #is baby-sit.#	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } my husband's working at Bell Labs,	24
I don't think I'd want to change it.	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C And } I actually did, -	24
there's a lot to be gained from a relationship  with an animal,	9
{F Um. }	26
{C and then } when they come out with the new things, you are like, {D well } why didn't you think of that before.	24
<Laughter> Yeah <laughter>.	15
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
{E I mean, } [ when did it, +  when did they ]  ((   )) , -	39
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	38
{C and } I needed to get that continent  (( since ))  I <laughter>, hadn't been there yet.	24
If you are a contract employee here -- -- # they test # you too.	24
that's the hard part because when we sit down to make it, we try to make it real spartan and real narrow so we can put a certain amount in savings every week	9
{C but } I think they are smart enough, to see there's nothing holy about it.	9
Right,	15
{D Well, } yeah,	36
{C and, } {F uh, } I used to live down in Dallas, there was just so many stories about, {F uh, } rest homes where the people are being abused, where the people are being kept in filthy conditions.	24
Yeah,	26
I know,	36
carpet cleaning <laughter>. -	24
{C but } they repeat all the old ones.	24
I really do think that's part of it.	9
No,	32
Yeah,	15
the only thing that sticks, [ in, +  inside  ] the engine compartment on this are the two, {F uh, } hose fittings.	24
it's just unreal.	9
[ that's, + that's ] where the speech program is.  {F Uh, }	24
By all means, go get that piece of paper,  {D you know. }	25
{F Uh, } just, -	26
# Uh-huh.  #	15
Yeah.	15
{C and, } {F uh, } {F uh, } that's [ [ the, + the, ] + the, ] {F uh, } -	26
{D Well, } it won't be too much longer  because my husband and I are both going to [ re-, +  retire. ]	24
My husband liked that --	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } they don't really see past next week much less next year.	9
Yeah,	36
# Uh-huh. #	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } it was still scary? {F Oh, } no.	2
Uh-huh.	15
# Yeah,	15
{C So, } I lay out there in the living room floor and do my exercises, {D you know. }	24
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh. } -	26
{F Uh, } you're very fortunate.	21
{F Uh, } in competitions -	24
{F Uh, } {C and } I think as far as if  it's, for put it into standards of, {F uh, } what other homes are around  here, it would be just about fitting right into the middle part of where the homes are.	24
{F Uh, } I don't remember, to tell you the truth.	34
I like # the, # -- -- idea.	24
It sure is.	36
That's true.#	36
it wasn't, {D you know, } {D like } a commercial project or something.	24
yeah.	36
<Child_crying> <child_talking> I would hate to be that person because you would be, {F uh, } {D you know, } bombarded by all the other eleven jurors -- -- to, {D you know, } just say he's guilty so we can get out of here and go	24
and that was all it, all it lasted for.	24
{C And, }  {F um, } they'd go after them saying, {F uh, } jeez what you really need is a defensive end.	24
All right <laughter>.	29
{C and } they were just really coming down on him because of [ some of the things he was, + just some of the things ] that he believed in, some of his morals.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Right.	36
Uh-huh.	15
<Music>  I, -	26
[ The, +  the ] extended loan payment for your car.	2
{C or, } God knows what.	16
# I just # have one child.	24
[  My, {F uh, } + I ] had four brothers	24
Yeah.	15
We'll start listening to children's music <laughter>.	24
{C and } we went all, <inhaling> -	24
You pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into [ your, + your ] -- -- tank.	24
-- {C and } I feel very strongly about, {F uh, } children, and, {F uh, } developed very strong feelings about this during our measles epidemic -- -- last year. Where we certainly proved that we're not doing a very good job with preventive health care among children and particularly the children who need it most.	24
I drive to work every day by myself, {F uh, } without [ even, + even ] any thought of car pooling.	24
{C And then } other times we jump in and do things	24
{C and then } I just have the rest of my house with lot of hand painting in it.	24
{C So } we all get to go to our own little  thing and drive through and get our own thing,	24
That may be the problem.	24
-- {E I mean, } [ in the, + in those ] places where, {F uh, } {D like } the economy is really bad, they might, {D you know, } be more tempted [ to, + to ] quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the, {D you know, } money to put food on the table and stuff like that.  More than they would <sigh>, {D you know, } in areas where they <sniffing> -	9
{C But, } what I was going to tell you, these Perry Homes back there, -	24
{C and } there's just so many other ways  ((   )) live down there.	9
The state actually did some [ good, + good ] work [ on that, + in that ] a couple of years ago.	9
I'm not sure that would be a terrifically good idea.	9
even [ if, +  if ] you take any car [ and, +  and ]   you care for it well enough, {F uh, } you are going to get some good life out of it.	9
Uh-huh.	15
You get the car that's in the accident	9
{C and } [ that's, + that's ] a real good thing, I guess.	9
Right.	15
I am married	24
{C And, } {F uh, } that's my job right now.	24
Right.	15
-- {C and, } {F um, } I find great disgust  in them, [ in their, + in  [ their, +  {F um, } <laughter> their ] ] self-centeredness -- -- and their inability to understand, {F um, }  multicultural or multiracial situation --	24
it was a book before it came out in a movie,	24
<Cough> We have cold.	34
# Yeah,	36
Yeah.	15
-- {C and } when we did, {F uh, } -	24
It's on [ schedule, +  {F um, } Schedule A ] under, {F uh, } -	24
Yeah,	15
I know,	36
I think given that people are pretty conscientious about it, -	9
I usually have them when [ I, + ] <sigh> there is a special event in our lives	24
{C but } where I am, [ the, + ] just {D like } all the hospitals, # they're # getting day care.	24
{D Well, } {D actually, } # that's # what I was thinking too.	36
Yeah.	15
Probably,	40
wouldn't I, {D you know, } -	16
We just sort of invest the money and go on vacations and always never seem to have any money problems which I guess is a comfortable thing.	24
{C but } he uses it. When he sees it to his advantage.	9
{D Well, } June, # is medium # sized.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but, } -	26
Sure,	36
{D So } how do you, {F uh, } -	39
{C and }  [ I, +  {D you know, } I ] say all power to her because she's an example to  me of someone who really does have the choice.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Are you serious?	7
it makes things very convenient.	9
{C and } I sure would like one ever those, {F uh, } {F uh, } within the next five years, or so.	24
That's interesting.	21
{C and then } I know people [ th-, + then ]   have visited nursing homes and, {F uh, } have had great, grandparents in the nursing  homes	24
{F Oh, } I know.	36
They got the forms in personnel	18
It just turned two, I believe.	24
{C so, } <laughter> -	26
{C and } they were real good about taking it back.	24
[ Some people, + some people ] can adjust and have both, do both well,	9
Uh-huh.	15
[ that's, + that's  ] kind of an interesting situation there.	9
[ they're, + they're ] terrified of them	9
No,	15
they know what they want	9
they've tried passing the  hat,	24
yeah.	15
{F Oh, } shoot it's only about ten bucks a month.	24
Oh yeah,	4
I don't think.	19
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } I, -	26
# Yep. #	15
I worked with an agency in West Texas [ that they, + it's where they ] really started this concept of Meals On Wheels --	24
they've gotten a lot with, {F uh, } -	26
yeah.	15
That is, {F uh, } probably enough to see <laughter>.	9
{C and } [ the-, +  they ]  had black forest cherry cake and all those things.	24
Right.	15
Right,	36
somewhere down  the line  they went standardized,	24
<Laughter>.	20
{F Um, } there are many reasons for it,	9
It's -	26
It really is	9
Capital punishment,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And, } {F uh } -- -- # I'm, {F uh, } # [ in, + in ] a government position that I'm in the news a lot	24
{C And so } for, -	26
{F Uh, } they've tried to lock me up and, {F uh, } things like that.	24
{C And } that's what I was using it for.	24
{C and, } -	26
# I didn't think much. #	11
# {F Oh, } uh-huh <laughter>. #	15
The Restaurant Ha-, -	30
<Noise>  <<piano in background>> Okay.	13
{C But, } {D you know, } the instant thing  [ [ may be, + may, ] + may be ]  the way of the future [ to, + {D you know, } to ] replace checks and every other thing.	9
{C but } then you can make your popcorn and {D you know, } be comfortable.	24
# {C so, } # [ i-, + {D you know, } I ]  think we [ were d-, + {D you know, } got a ] good deal on it.	24
Most of them would say, {D you know, } those people should be removed from the school system.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } {E I mean } just [ this, + this ]  little town here is basically a college town.	24
and I fly into Montana a lot	24
I know.	36
Really <laughter>.	15
Yes,	10
{C But } {E I mean, } you don't have to spend the big money, as far as I'm concerned [ to, +   {F uh, } to ] win.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Spoons and, -	2
No,	33
yeah.	15
{D So. }  {F Uh, } it's, I don't know, an urban area, I guess	9
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } {C or } we'll suddenly be in the dark  and say, {F Oh, } my goodness, now we don't have the ability to go on to some new technology.	9
{C And, }  {F uh, } it's just human  nature to walk through an open door.	9
Yeah	15
I tell you what,	13
# Uh-huh. #	15
Uh-huh.	15
{D You know, } [ {C because, } + {D you know, } {C because, } ]  {F uh, } the country's going to wind up paying for the treatment of patients.	9
{F Uh, } I think it was one night a week -- -- for {D like } six weeks,	24
we-, -	26
{F Uh, } there is an area beyond Thousand Oaks, north of Los Angeles that is really an eerie, strange looking area -- -- with boulders,	24
{C but } I don't know,  [ if, + if ] the next time I'm going to try  [ to, + to ] stay with buying something American or if I'm going to go for a little more,  what I would consider to be a long-term investment <laughter>.	24
I know,	36
{C And } you can, probably spend, <breathing> {F uh, } a lot of time, {F uh, } or maybe eventually, <breathing> {F uh, } just waiting it out,	9
some of them are pretty rough.	24
{C But, } -	26
Right on,	38
Yeah.	15
{C And } just like you say, we go to, {F uh, } a community area where they have it set up	24
Oh.	15
-- {C and } I think he has gone over the limit.	9
{F Um, } [ I, + I ] don't know if you [ he-, + [ re-, + ] heard ] about the, {F uh, } recent legislation in, {F uh, } Colorado, {F uh, } against a power company, {F uh, } that's actually on Indian land, I believe,	24
There's, -	26
[ I, + I ] won't really be interested [ in going to, + in going ] there. Because, I feel like [ I'm, + I'm ] paying, {D you know, } five dollars for the food probably and five dollars for something that I could get along quite well without <laughter>.	24
It, -	26
{C and } it was really interesting to see <throat_clearing> just what you do spend	24
{C But } I do try to build in a little  extra money each month [ to, +  to ] be able to do that type of thing #	24
Yeah.	15
# I. # -	26
{C and } now I have one or  two of them,	24
{E I mean, } [ it's, + it's ] like a bullet going by.	9
{C and so } I got over there,	24
{C but, }  {F um, } <lipsmack> the problem is we are all really scattered, around.	24
# Yeah. #	15
# Uh-huh.  #	15
WONDER YEARS?	7
Yeah,	15
{E I mean, } {F um, } they can deal with that -- -- scale.	24
{C and } I let it pretty much,	24
I think  Dallas is pretty scattered.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } I need to see it.	24
there's more that don't have it	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
How do you like it?	39
[ I, + I ] do some things.	24
I think it was -- -- closer to downtown.	24
Right.	15
# [ I think in, + # I think in ] the city they  do	24
you have to concentrate on it, it seems.	22
No,	33
[ {C Or, } + {C or }  ] {D like } evidently people go in there and they're not satisfied that they'd been given enough and they complain	9
I feel strongly about this topic.	24
they grow up too fast,	9
{C But } -- -- the kids were, -	24
I really enjoy, -	24
and, and they carry quite a bit about the U S on the other hand.	9
Yeah.	15
Yes.	36
{C So, }  [ [ I, + I don't, ] + [ I, + I ] guess ] we'll have to see another generation  to see what differences a child being brought up, {D you know, } in [ a, +  {F uh, } kind of a, ] {F uh, } community, rather than a home.	9
{C So, }  I'm # pretty happy. #	24
# Uh-huh.  #	15
{F Oh, } that's great.	21
Yeah.	15
I imagine.	9
{C and } if you are, not only will they not give you, {F uh, } a policy,	9
yeah.	36
{C but } I do think that, {F um, } Congress has backed down much too much on some of the air pollution standards.	9
{C But, } {F uh, } nevertheless, I think people are just getting fed up and saying, {D you know, } you can't arrest all of us,	24
{D well, } I don-, -	26
I haven't watched, {F um } -- -	24
Uh-huh.	15
I think it's great, that {D you know, } freedom of speech in this country and  everything, -	9
-- {C but, } [ I'm not, + I'm not ] naive, to think that my children are not going to not do it.	24
Yeah.	15
[ [ # {C And } # -- + -- {C and so } ] I, +  {C but } [ I, + I ] ] suspect a number of them.	24
{C and } we need to have different punishments {D you know. }	9
we have done a little bit of camping.	24
the boys --	24
Right.	15
{C so } I got him to take the alternator off and take it  and, {F uh, } {D you know, } get a replacement part.	24
{F Uh, } {C so, } you have children I take it?	8
Bye-bye.	38
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
Let's see,	17
{D like } last night was a band concert --	24
I went and saw, {F uh, } I think it was, {F uh, } SUGAR BABIES,	24
{F Oh, } wow.	21
[ we, +  we ] have done that.	24
-- what we learned. -	26
Have you taken it?	7
Uh-huh.	29
{C So } I've had to deal a lot with child care	24
Yes.	36
Yeah. #	26
{C but } it's so cheap they don't have a problem here.	24
{C and, } {D like } [ I've said, + I've ] made four calls,	24
Right.	36
Yes,	4
{C And, }  {F uh, } -	26
{F Oh, } it's an excellent movie.	24
We do eat, {F uh, } eggs [ and, + and  ] milk products.	24
They just lay them off.	24
{C But } not for petty theft?	8
<breathing>	20
<Laughter> Boys <laughter>.	2
I guess [ that's, + that's ] what, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } [ how, + how ] old are you?	39
<Laughter> That's right,	36
{F Uh, } [ that, + ] {D you know, } we've done that too.	24
Yeah.	15
[ do you, + [ ha-, + can ] you ] recall.	7
{C But, } {F uh, } that Jimmy Johnson came in, too, though,	24
it's the type that if you go to a certain doctor then, {F uh, } you just pay ten dollars	24
Don't do [ any, + {F uh, } any ] gardening in the sense of, {F uh, }  vegetable gardening	24
Yes	36
Yeah.	15
if you look at the region [ in, + in, ] {F uh, } -	24
<ringing> {C but } I like that where they run tense.	24
{C But, } {F uh, } you pay a premium	24
Two hours where?	14
<clicking> The only experience I have, -	24
{C And } I think, {D you  know, } {D again } -	26
I don't.	24
-- {C but, } {F uh, } -	26
{C And } also they value learning.	24
Yeah.	15
Right,	15
{C And } you can look at [ the, + {F uh, } the ]  track record on, a car over the year,	24
{C So, } you can, {F uh, } -	26
yeah.	36
What is it?	39
{F Oh, } my gosh.	21
{C and } [ I, + I ] think that drugs, -	24
definitely.	36
{C But, } at least on things like stock options and things like that, they don't tax me.	24
in fact, I don't run.	24
if something like, {F uh, } -	26
# {C and } you # ... -	26
Yeah,	30
{C and } that was about it, {D you know. }	24
{C but, }  {E I mean, } we were going to the doctor once a week,	24
[ Doesn't this, + {D yeah, }  {E I mean, } doesn't this ] encourage murder, in order to wipe out the -- -- the witnesses?	7
I didn't know there were such things.	24
Yes,	4
{F Uh, } there were a few things different than the old series,	24
# Yeah. #	15
# Exactly.  #	21
{C but } I think the appeal process is really getting in the way.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah	15
{C and then } it's solid rock from then on  down,	24
{C So, } -	26
Yeah.	15
Yeah	15
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and then, } ] {F uh. } -	26
[ {C but, } + {C and then } ] after that [ it was, + it  ] got better,	24
we both have older cars	24
Is that right?	12
It, {F uh, } <laughter>, -	26
I'm on the phone <child_talking>.	10
[ I've, + {F uh, } {D you know, } I've ]  helped out extremely, {F uh, } -	24
Yep <laughter>.	15
[ they're, + they ] make some plastic edging stuff that comes in {D like } three foot lengths.	24
after a while I'll start watching it --	24
yes,	36
{C and then } you have thirty minutes of aerobic activity starting,  {D you know, } slowly and then working up to, {F uh, } {D you know, } a high  heart rate	24
I'm glad that Mister Johnson's changed  his tune on, {F uh, } safe sex to abstinence,	24
uh-huh.	15
[ he just, + he ] couldn't get up,	24
{F Um, } -kay. -	15
Right.	15
I actually get most of my news coverage off {F uh, } computer networks.	24
# Yeah,	15
I never watched KNOTS LANDING,	24
that, and semigloss for trim work,  and usually flat for walls.	2
I guess, {F uh, } the only rule, {F uh, } I can think of is that I like to look for places with, {F uh, } good respectable, nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that.	24
Yes.	15
# Yeah. #	36
Uh-huh,	15
perky is a good word for it -- -- when you exercise.	9
are you familiar with that, from your histories lessons or whatever.	7
Right,	15
{C and } interesting enough, this time we're changing the color which makes it an addition.	24
[ She gr-, + she went ] through college and graduated very high up in her class and had, {F uh, } gotten a job [ as, + as ] an instructor	24
<Throat_clearing>.	20
{C and } they say, {D well, } why should I even vote.	9
{C and so }  pretty much now, {F uh, } we don't use them  too much.	24
Right.	36
[ par-, + parents ] aren't encouraging their kids to do things like that.	9
[ I was, + I was ] discussing with someone before, {F um, } -	24
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
my family moved to Connecticut,	24
{C and, } {E I mean, } it just, seems like, {F uh, } a lot of those ideas generate out of California.	9
# Yeah. #	15
{C and so, } [ [ we, + we, ] + in our minds we're ] thinking what's the big deal.	24
Isn't it Mexican?	7
{C and } that's it,  and some hard-boiled eggs.	24
<Laughter>  {F Oh, } I don't know,	19
{D Well, } no,	32
{C But, } {F um, } [ it, + it  ] is a problem,	9
All right.	38
{F Uh, }	17
yes,	36
# Wonderful. #	21
Yeah.	36
{C And, }  I'm going {D well, } {D you know, } [ there's more to life, + {D you know, } there's life ] in there that's, -	24
Yeah,	36
Right.	15
# {C and } # they've never been afraid.	24
I don't, -	26
{C and } kids nowadays are just given so much that they really don't have to work,	9
aside from the American Express, I do use my Sears card.	24
{C and } we saw it during the war just now, is that we got all the information within minutes, {D you know. }	24
{C And, }  {F uh, } he was showing it to me	24
[ I'm, + I'm ] one of these people who's actually a die hard Mets fan, and an avid Yankee hater.	24
{C and } the kids and I like to go out and camp in the tent.	24
{C But } [ [ it, + it, ] + {D you know, } we ]  looked at a lot of houses that [ were, + had ] more square footage,	24
Uh-huh.	15
What, {F uh, } department do you work in?	39
{C So, } {F uh, } {D you know, }  you need to go to a school that handles whatever it is you want to do.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } I have seen a big change,  I think, in high school kids that my relatives <<rattling paper>>, and friends, that, {F um, } I know when I was in  high school I had an idea of what I really wanted to do with -- -- [ what my, + what I ]  was going to study	24
{D Well, } {C so } it was a completely  new experience for you.	22
{C and } when you're gone from some place [ like it + for about ] six years as we were, you really begin to see, {F uh, } just how problematic just living is, # even # suburban, no matter where you are,	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C and, } {F uh, } -	26
{C but } it's recent material.	24
-- yeah,	15
(( believe me ))  it's just so much better.	9
{C And then } you can do it whenever you want I guess.	9
# [ I, + # I ] can see, -	24
{C and } they bring their drugs home	9
{C And, } {F uh, } she got to the point she didn't want to alone anymore.	24
yeah.	26
sure did.	24
[ [ they, + in fact they   just, ] + it was just ] a big thing recently	24
{C But } I did not know that these hyacinths, -	24
{D well, } there's two.	24
{C and }  I'm sure they'll go on to graduate school,	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C and, }  {F uh, } -	26
{F Oh, } I'll bet they did.	36
{E I mean, } were they glad?	7
They've had some serious problems in the past couple of years.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
The DALLAS MORNING NEWS is a good paper.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I was down in the water [ and, +   and ] set to go	24
{D Well, } {C and } I know I love them,	24
I don't know,	19
{C and } it is a smaller  size	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
You're supposed to, {D you know, } go in [ if you have, + {D you know, } {D like } if you've ] never heard of the people before or anything,	9
<Laughter>.	20
[ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] it was new  carpeting	24
{D see. }  # -	26
{C but } after you get into them, they're really good.	9
Yeah,	15
[ {C Or, } + {C or }  ] they want the right to make the same mistakes themselves to bootstrap them up to [ the way, + ] where we -- -- got to.	24
{C and } it is just excellent.	24
That is a shame.	9
{C And } [ they have all really got, + {F uh, } they have all really got ] really good jobs.	24
I guess it's too early.	9
Wow.	21
{D Well } <throat_clearing>, I love to work outside,  really,	24
And that's what I think they're saying too.	9
{D Well, } {F uh, } I used to a long time ago	24
{C And } those are excellent.	24
{C and } they keep  everyone else away from you.	24
{C and } the skunk. -	30
Garth Brooks is outselling Guns and Roses	24
yeah.	26
I don't know why.	24
{C And } Warren Moon, # [ is, + is ] # proving himself quite well right now.	9
{C and } it includes, {D you know, } salad and rolls and,  {F oh, } some other stuff,	24
{D like, } I don't think one test positive should, {F uh, } be, {F uh, } <<pause>> the end of it, {D you know. }	24
I had one call [ f-, +  actually  from ] Charlotte, North Carolina,  and Virginia, and,  {F um, } -	24
[ [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] + {C and } ] [ th-, + there ] needs to be a line drawn somewhere [ at, + ] [ rea-, + reasonable ] and proper.	9
-- {C and, } {F uh, } that's another  big thing I think people get out of college is the appreciation for [ different point, +  differing points ] of view, {D you know, } or different opinions.	9
{C and } we'll <laughter> say, wait a minute.	24
{F Oh, } you do know Lotus, {F huh? }	16
it's always ran just fine, the clock and stuff.	24
<<Person in the background replies>>  (( Where at? )) .	10
{C but } I think it would be a great idea.	9
# (BONFIRE OF THE VANITY )) , #	2
<Sniffing>.	20
# {C So. } # -	26
{C but } [ I can't, + {D you know, } I remember ] these stories	24
{C And } usually once a week I will bake something,	24
[ [ {C or } + {C but } ] [ I, + <whistling> I ] +  {C and } I'm ] don't, rarely listen to the, {F uh, } radio	24
Huh-uh. #	15
{C and } I spent every minute I could to be with her and, {F uh, } cooking foods for her, {D you know, } just to make [ her, + her ] life as though she were on vacation.	24
{C so } we don't have to keep talking about nothing anymore <laughter>.	24
<Laughter> Yes,	15
-- {F um, } {F uh, } [ it was the, +   it's one of the ] best movies I've seen in a long time.	24
{F Uh, } a [ little bit, + little bit, ]	11
{F Uh, } {D well, } no,	32
Yeah,	4
Yeah,	15
it's not a late movie.	24
We never  ((   ))  any more.	24
{C So } it's fairly picturesque.	9
[ It's not, + it's not ] quite the bargain that #  ((   )) . #	36
Yeah.	15
{C And } it's the men that make the rules <laughter>.	9
# Yeah,	15
{C Because } [ it, + {D you know, } {F uh, } {D like, } there ] was an incident several years ago where an Amtrak engineer (( )) {D you know } -- -	24
Yeah.	30
Good night.	38
{C but, } {F uh. } Yeah,	13
Sure would.	36
I know,	36
(( Right ))  <<faint>>.	15
{C so. }   {F Oh, } {D well. }  I guess we bought a lot of, -	24
We're {D like, } -	24
{C and } I read in this article, {A I couldn't believe it, } where, {D you know, } {D like, } one cow [ produces, + {D like, } a day, produces ] like a hundred or so pounds of manure.	24
What do you do?	31
I don't know, {F uh, }	19
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	26
No.	15
[ {C But, } + {C but } ] the problem [ is, + is ] that [ we, + we ] only have but so much room	9
{C But, } that has changed a lot.	9
{C So, } [ I, + what I ]  said that I wasn't being real facetious about that.	24
Right.	15
{F Uh, } I think [ the, + my ] greatest complaint about news programs is programs like SIXTY MINUTES.	24
{C and } it wasn't trained quite fully either --	24
{C and } they're going to rebuild	25
[ Buy a, +  [ wha-,  ar-, you, + ] buy a ] used car?	14
They, {D you know, } usually let her,	24
my current project is a walkway which I'm building around the house and out to the backyard [ to, + ] {F uh, } {D you know, } digging it out and laying sand and  putting, {F uh, } pavers on top of that	24
{F Uh, } I don't know,	24
{C and } I really don't see an advantage of Windows at all.	9
{C although, } {F uh, } I will personally tell you, I used to work at a bank,	24
don't ever let age, -	24
if we had a quarterback this year we would have went to the Super Bowl.	9
-- right	15
If someone's having personal problems for some reason that's causing them to [ h-, + ] behave differently --	9
{C and } [ [ it's, + it, ] + it's ] something you can all, -	9
some, # girls # were there in the morning	13
{F Uh, } excellent warranty, {E I mean, } just, unbelievable warranty.	24
(( your right )) ,  ((   )) .	36
No.	36
{D well, } they didn't, -	26
I will have to stop in there.	24
{C And } I wanted something that I could  maybe walk through and get to them	24
{D Well, } it's hard to talk about something,	9
Yeah	15
{F Um, } they had some flooding in Houston the other day, real, real bad -- -- [ over, + I think it was over ] the weekend.	24
{C And } they don't have to go get one, {D you know. }	9
Yeah,	15
# Uh-huh.  #	15
Yeah.	15
{C and } they had, {F uh, } ag,	24
I keep hoping for.	24
{C So } (( we've ))  done. -	26
{D you know, } when they're trying to get rid of those cars at the end of the year like  that, they really come down on their prices	24
# Sure it is. #	36
{F Oh, } {D well, } [ we made, + I made ] guacamole that I would take to a pool party across the street the other day,	24
{C and } they come, with a new car warranty,	24
{C and } I need to have more information about people.	24
{C and } they're all competing with each.	24
farm report and oil reports.	24
[ {C And, } + {C and then } ] I saw that other movie about, {F uh, } [ MOTHER, DAUGHT-, + MOTHER, WIFE, ] MURDERER.	24
{C but, } [ I, + I ]  don't get to see that as much as I want	24
# {F Uh. }  #	26
Okay,	15
[ I, + I ] do that,	24
Right.	15
{C and } it's paid for.	24
Might be a good idea, because you're  going to get, what, [ a, +  a ] check, -	9
That's right.	11
-- {C and, } {F uh, } I'm letting their mother read on the grandchildren <laughter>.	24
you can  buy them in kits	24
Yeah.	15
I'm satisfied with the vacation.	24
[ Do you have, + {F uh, } do you have ] a family?	7
-- {C and, }  {F uh, } they all can build up.	9
they don't really pay a whole lot of attention to buffers.	24
{C and } ... {F Oh, } okay.	13
{C But } [ it, +   that ] was really, really fabulous	24
Which do you work in, {E excuse me? }	39
I, -	26
that's where I was.	24
{C and } the atmosphere there is really, really nice.	24
{C And } every once in a  while I will be digging through the closet,	24
what else?	39
You can't put it in pictures.	9
[ I'm kind of, + I'm kind of ] bad about it.	24
{D well, } [ what the computer, +  what the C E T ] program seems to be so far is just a broad based specialized from, -	24
It doesn't seem fair to me.	24
I almost lost our electricity here )) .	24
{C And } I had a great time doing that.	24
Uh-huh.	15
we have a dog, a little white Lhasa.	24
{C because, } -	26
{F Uh, } the nanny type.	22
right,	15
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
I think you would really like PRETTY WOMAN,	9
uh-huh.	15
Your camping experience is probably, -	9
{C And } it helps you feel a strong sense of belonging.	9
{D Well, } [ I, + I  ] do like recipes and crafts.	24
# {D So } <laughter>. # -	26
Yes.	15
{C and } it doesn't really,	24
# Okay,	29
{D Now } I also, -	24
Public relations,	30
{F Oh, } okay.	29
Yeah.	30
{F Um. }	26
{C so } it's probably out in that direction,	24
[ [ it was really, + it was really, ] + {F oh, } {D well, } it was all ] full with, {F uh, } shelves everywhere	24
I guess I got a good example from my mother,	24
Okay.	38
She told me about five thirty one afternoon, it was a Friday, that she wasn't keeping kids anymore as of Monday morning.	24
{F Huh. }  That is interesting though.	21
{C And } also I'm interested in writing some programs that will kind of  {D like } remind me of things  like remind me that Wednesdays is trash day and the like.	24
I had wondered sometimes,	24
{C And } since our kids aren't little anymore, I'm not buying a lot of  those little things # <laughter> that can get broken. #	24
<Laughter>.	20
get them out there,	9
if they don't make a criminal check, why do you have to be fingerprinted.	16
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] in the winter, {D you know, } I [ just add a, + ] maybe wear longer sleeve shirts than I do in the summer.  And add a heavier jacket or,  {D you know, } wear jackets more in the winter than I do in the summer.	24
I don't have time to read the book.	24
[ [ it's, + {F uh, } it's, ] + {F uh, } it's, ] {F uh, } -	26
{F Uh, } deliberate childbirth by surrogate mother.	24
{C So } there's a whole big effect on our kids	9
{C and } if you have children, if you go to McDonald's, [ you co-, + they have ] coupons, or did have.	24
{C And } people are looking for alternate ways of,  {F uh, } -	24
he said since being there  {A and I guess he's been there about six months, }	24
-- {C because } [ I, + I ] didn't,	24
Yeah.	15
[ tha-, +  that's ] enough.	2
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I just hadn't gotten around to doing it,	24
<Laughter>.	20
When we finally out that liters was about  a quart, there's about four liters in a gallon	24
I understand that.	21
[ Mine, + mine, ] -	26
Uh-huh,	15
keys and things are something to me that remain a mystery no matter how many times I bang on them.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
Right.	15
{F Oh, } there one guy brags about his piece of equipment he's using and the drop cloths and all that kind crap	24
<Thumping>.	20
I don't just read everything about it,	24
{C but. } -	26
{F Uh, } {D well, } the values, more or less at home and the T V, just a general, -	9
{D so, } -	26
<Laughter>  Yeah.	15
{F Um, } basically Mexican food.	24
You think it might [ b-, + get better, ] huh?	7
In my household, we have a little bit, of, uh, a fight for whose boss.	24
{C but } you've got to hit enough speed and the right angle that [ it's, + it's, ] {D you know, } -	24
-- {D you know, } we were going up to a larger one,	24
{C so, } -	26
{C And } the tanks came in  and, {D you know, } pretty much took care of that.	24
Yeah.	15
# Okay. #	15
{F Oh, } thank you.	42
{C And } amazingly enough, the very next day they had an opening,	24
It was on the news every night.	24
Yeah,	36
{C And, so } my husband and I loaded bricks in his, # pickup truck for # days.	24
They probably give you a chance to explain yourself -- -- and then maybe give you another chance to go through it.	24
Yeah,	36
[ {C and } + {C or } ] do we kind of say, well you can be drug tested	35
Right.	15
{F Oh, } I don't know.	34
okay.	29
True.	21
<Laughter>.	20
{C And } while I was there I visited my aunt and uncle who were,  {F uh, } staying for their vacation in France in Nantes, which is on the west coast, {D like } right across from England.	24
{F Oh } the worst kind,	2
He's replaced almost as many clubs as he has balls.	24
that's not a broad enough topic <laughter>.	24
{F Um, } usually, {F uh, } word processing something, {F um, } <lipsmack> such as, {F oh, } forms for things, {F uh, } -	24
Yeah.	15
{F Um, } [ I, + I'm  ] in college right now,	24
{C So } it's, -	26
[ {C But, } + {C but, } ] once I suppose [ you, + you ] prove yourself by paying this off next year -- -- you'll be in very good shape.	9
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
I never had the desire,	24
{F um, } they don't really  buy the first quality,	24
We're going through that,	24
Or there?	35
I don't think it's going to be that easy to come up with --	9
{C and, }  # -	26
<Laughter>.	20
I was from Illinois,	24
Were they teenagers	7
{D Well, } that sounds fun.	21
Yeah.	15
{F Um. }	26
{C And } [ he don't, + {D you know, } he don't ] gain it like I do.	24
this is just something on the side	24
{C So } it's very much the same kind of place # [ and, + ] {F uh } # -- -- the technical institution.	9
[ {C and, } + {C and }  ] <breathing> we shared one, the three of us	24
it's been a pleasure talking to you.	38
that's pretty much the south end of the state,  or the southern quarter of the state, anyway? <noise>.	7
Uh-huh.	15
No,	33
{F Uh. }	26
Not much at all <laughter>.	24
<Laughter>.	20
I like things that, {D you know, } two people can do,	24
{C and } they seem to be really good cars for it.	24
{C and } the judge called and had it all canceled so he could get his money back	24
several times in the last couple of weeks it has looked rainy that day -- -- and [ not, + not ] done anything.	24
Uh-huh,	15
That's one part of gardening I haven't tried yet,	24
Disc brakes don't seem to give me too much problem	24
{C So } it's really great.	24
{F Oh, } SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN comes to our house,  too, I forgot,	24
Yeah.	15
{C but } [ the, + the  ] humidity has hung around all of June.	24
{D Well, } I think that, {F uh, } we need to spend more family time together [ with, + with ] children today.	9
-- {C and } the larger they are,  the more room they need to exercise.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I also listen to, {F uh, } these twenty-four hour news stations, when I'm driving.	24
-- {C and } they've done well <noise>.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
{D well } the bedroom would probably be the easier of the two because it would be just plain painting.	9
{C and } you can request whatever maintenance records exist on cars	24
{C but, } {F um, } [ I think when you push, + {D you know, } maybe I think when ] that was first trying come about with, {D you know, } what we know as the women's lib movement --	9
[ Every, + everybody ] makes the obligatory trip to Stonehenge.	9
{C And } we # don't know. #	24
{C but } I'm my best customer.	24
{C But   then } [ they, + they ]  tell me Hell is much better than west Texas.	24
That's good.	21
[ [ I'm, + I am, ] + {F uh, } I ] go to the Church of Christ.	24
[  It's, + it ] must just take a hundred percent concentration, I guess, because they know they're going to get hit,	9
[ I, +  I ] told them I'd be available during this time,	24
Uh-huh.	15
# {C and } # what happened was her  husband was, {F uh, } involved in a motorcycle accident where a drunk driver ran the stoplight	24
{F Oh, } if you had a thousand dollars, that means there's another hundred dollar deduction I've given you.	24
{C but, } {F uh, } -	26
we'll see how that goes.	24
Yeah.	15
I wouldn't know,	19
<Lipsmack>  Oh.	21
{C and } everybody hates it,	24
{F Oh, } that sounds like a [ fun, + fun ] field.	9
I do believe that's in.	24
{C and, } {F uh, } part of that <cough> {E excuse me, } was, as a new hire, that I had to take a drug test,	24
[ he, + {F uh, }   {D well } {D actually } right now # he ] lives in Rhode Island,	24
{C but, } Yeah.	13
Yeah.	15
Do they charge a lot of interest on that card?	7
{C and } he's out of the house.	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ {C and } +  -- -- {C and so } ] I've haven't seemed to have gotten out as much,	24
Yeah <laughter>.	15
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] that has a lot to do with his strength and his, just pitching in [ and, + and ] his being able to, {D you know, } all, all ego aside, do a lot of things -- -- that really, -	24
My husband wants to go into medical school and be a neurosurgeon	24
# <Throat_clearing> Uh-huh. #	15
[ Have, +  has ] anything in particular  changed that you have noticed? During your time there.	7
it's what they call [ pecan, + pecan ] pie up there in the East.	24
[ We, + I ] was the only one who did not catch, a single fish --	24
right,	36
{F Uh, } Rick, {F uh, } Bogarts played -- -- <Dishes> too	24
I find [ I, + I ] read very little,	24
I don't know,	19
Yeah.	15
Okay.	13
{F Um. } Yeah,	36
Okay,	13
Bye-bye.	38
{D Well, } {D see, } we've got a little  bit of it, but not much.	24
Yeah.	15
{F Oh } my gosh.	21
# {F Uh, } #	26
some are starting to have, is day care --	24
{C and, } {D you know, } I would get hung up by my boot straps [ if I ra-, + if I ever mentioned ] the Ford product in my family.	24
Right,	36
I don't know.	19
{C and } if you're up to the point where if he still qualifies for capital punishment, <noise> then you can look at mitigating circumstances.	24
The minimum they want you to do is three times a week.	24
Is that what you're, -	7
# Uh-huh. #	15
{F Oh, } gosh.	21
the i-, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
-- {F oh, } boy,	21
{D Well. }	26
{C And } also the evenings are going to be getting, {F uh, } darker sooner -- -- [ becau-, + as ] it gets cooler.	24
yeah,	4
{D Well, } I never gave it any thought myself <laughter>.	24
{C because, } <throat_clearing> {D you know, } if we don't want that to happen all we have to do is just call the phone company and say, look, {D you know, } I want my name unlisted or want # my, {D you know, } # -	24
<Laughter>.	20
You have to do that.	24
{F Um, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
# Yeah. #	15
Uh-huh,	15
we have it usually [ at this, + {F uh, } at this ]  one park because there is a pavilion there, in case -- -- it rains.	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } I'm working on a carnival that's going to be in a couple of weeks for our school	24
I know.	36
Yeah.	15
it's just a cut [ in the withhold, + in the amount withheld,  ] {D you know. }	9
#Right,	15
{C And } I like that idea if they can handle it themselves.	24
{C But, } then again <throat_clearing> I originally was  from California	24
It's just a small one, {D you know, }	24
it's funny.	9
they do have sports cars --	24
The Chinese type.	30
-- {C and so } I've just requested that they send us two of our coach tickets	24
{D Well, } that's, -	26
She isn't recovered <laughter>.	9
{C And, } {F uh, } without the Lord, they can't do it.	9
my, {F uh, } grandmother, {F um, }  made us a couple of quilts for the baby,	24
You too.	38
It's [ the, {F uh, }   an-, +  from an animal ] shelter.	24
Yes.	15
{C but } I do not think it's a chain.	24
[ I just, +  I just, ] -	26
{C but} there are a few guns that, {F uh,} just are not, {F uh,} sport,	9
It's just great.	24
Hate to put it that way.	24
Right.	15
It's kind of funny because people are just petrified, at least some are, at the thought of nuclear.	24
We tried to start that in my husband's  family.	24
{F Uh, } the one nice thing about the bicycle is you just sit.	9
[ I can, + I can ] [ se-, + tell ] you, {F oh, } so much about that movie, just because [ it, + it ] really [ rang, + {F uh, } rang ] a lot of [ my, + {F uh, } my ] personal background.	24
I don't, -	26
-- {C and } it's still tied up in the legal channels.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } [ we, + we  ] just feel [ they should, + they should  ] offer industry some incentives to do more reducing of their waste products and reusing,	24
They'd all be pretty similar to one another within  [ a, + a ] couple miles.	24
{D well. } [ My, + my ] mother has one that's, {F uh, } -	24
#Yeah.#	15
it's,  {F uh, } I think once or twice a week.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } I know,	36
[ Did they, + did they ]  make it to the play-offs at all?	7
I'm from Wisconsin,	24
His house is more like a farm house.	24
{F Oh } really <laughter>.	15
{F Um, } <lipsmack> {F uh, }  let's see,	17
{D You know, } after a while you make  some stuff,	24
I'm sure, that the Peace Corps  [ pays, it + ] doesn't pay well,	9
[ He, + he ] does that quite a bit.	24
{C and, } {D you know, } (( )) presidents have always avoided that -- -- as a country.	24
Well	15
I think is a [ good, + good  ] example, {D you know, } that even, industry is willing to do it.	24
Yeah,	36
<Child_crying> Right.	15
<Laughter>.	20
Do you, {F uh, } -	26
{C and } he let her out,	24
{C so } she goes out riding as much <bird_squawk> as she can.	24
My wife works part-time.	24
{D Well, } we've got, {F um, } -	26
{C and } they housed them and stuff.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } do they have such a thing now as a six man jury?	7
Really?	12
My name is Jean.	6
Sometimes it's really nice to be able to go out and eat with just my husband	24
{D Well, } I'm glad to know that there's somebody else out there that doesn't get to go to the movie theater <laughter>.	24
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] I guess right now the one in my mind is health insurance	24
[  I, + I ] noticed at the library or someplace this past, {F uh, } month, month and a half ago, they were having a speaker, {F um, } talk about doing lawn work and, [ h-, + how ] important it is [ to, + to ] cut your lawn without a bag.  Just to kind of mulch it, # rather # than bag it up, because of [ a-, + all ] [ the + the  ] grass that's being bagged and being hauled away by the garbage trucks and stuff,	24
{C and } during the week they go back and do some more.	24
I wish I could <laughter>.	24
{C But, } {F uh, } -	26
they're all real young,	24
it has been, Becky,	38
At my office, we have two big cardboard boxes in the library where  everybody goes to pick up their mail,	24
{C and } the only thing, [ they, + they ] would think of would be tuition, {D you know, }	9
{C so } they, have to absorb it somewhere else.	9
Uh-huh,	15
{C and, } {D you know, } there's such a small voice and such a huge number of people in the United States	9
{F Um, } he's a real sports kind of person,	24
Yeah,	15
# Uh-huh.  #	15
Oh.	29
{C or } if their children, {D you know, } passed away before they did -- -- they can be in some places [ that are, + {D you know, } [ that, + that ] are ] not good.	9
[ in a lot of, + {D well, } especially in things, ] you pick up the paper,	24
{C because } the other teams [ are, + ] I'm sure practice a lot more,	9
[ I, + [ a, + ] {F uh, } I ] grew up in South Dakota,	24
Too many people have [ too many, + too much ] access.	9
Yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
isn't it too large for normal town driving, finding parking places -- -- # and getting in and out the doors? #	7
Yeah.	15
whittling or <laughter>, -	24
{D So } Ken, how do you do your family budget?	16
For your -- -- <Throat_clearing> tole painting.	8
Yeah.	4
{C and } before that we had all Dachshunds,	24
I can buy the cookies in a larger quantity than they can,	24
{D you know, } {D like } AIDS and all that stuff? {D You know, } with [ se-, + {D you know, } your sex,  ]  (( {D you know } )) . -	8
they could send all the people over to, {F uh, } {D you know, } one particular  part of town or one particular project, that somebody had paid somebody to, {D you know, }  get supported,	9
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } -- -- {F uh, } we came back with sweets.	24
{C And } I didn't realize, when I moved here, that it was a separate town from Dallas <laughter>.	24
yeah.	15
I haven't had my oldest one quite nine years,	24
{C and so } if it's an overcast day then the weather is pretty blah <laughter>. Because I really have to catch some sunshine or else I feel like I live in a cave all the time,	24
{C and } that doesn't mean  that you leave it in tact.  *[[in tact -> intact]]	9
Uh-huh.	36
That is for sure.	21
[ [ I, + I  gues-, ] + I guess ] to answer the question directly, I'm still just [ a, + a ] little bit, {D you know, } leery of the whole thing.	9
in fact, a big gubernatorial issue is [ the + -- -- the ] turnover rates of, {F uh, } [ r-, + {F uh, } repeat ] offenders being let out and  # doing it again. #	24
[ I, + I'm ] more of a fiction and nonfiction reader [ [ [ that, + n-, ] + n-, ] + not ] of that nature though.	24
{C So } I asked  him if I could play the bass clarinet,	24
{F Oh. }  {F Oh, } {D well } that's real nice because I can remember two years ago that in about February the hundred degree weather started in San Antonio and just continued.	24
was it good.	7
-- it doesn't matter who it is	24
I know,	9
-- {C and, } {F um, } they say that the average English student nowadays does at least fifty percent less reading and writing than they did twenty years ago,	24
Do you watch sports much on T V?	7
What, -	26
[ {C And, } + {C And } ] it makes an awful lot  of difference, doesn't it?	7
{D Well, } <noise>  {F uh, } quite a few	24
I'm, -	26
{C And, } {F uh, } this guy was going nuts,	24
[ {C but } -- + -- {C but } ] it really, -	26
she has four sons and  two daughters,	24
{C and } it started raining really heavy	24
I thought it was a pretty good show.	24
{C and } there's a lot of things we need that we just can't afford.	24
I'm doing fine.	6
{F Oh, } I'm not surprised.	21
I was shocked.	24
that's great for parents to be involved.	21
The glossy paper that says, buy this, and send off for that and -- -- you have won and all that.	24
I would suspect your nights would be pretty quiet for the most part.	24
I only get the newspaper on the weekends	24
Yeah.	15
absolutely.	36
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	38
(( {F Oh, } uh-huh	15
{C And } that really made it a very interesting, {F uh, } show to where you never really knew [ which, + which ] one was going to show up.  {D You know, } whether it was going to, where they're going to be real close or whether they're just going to be partners, {D you know } --	9
in fact I'm  doing that right now with their afternoons, when they get home before I do.  {D You know, }	24
{C But } I like SIXTY MINUTES, PRIME TIME LIVE.	24
{D Now } I'll go along with that. {D You know, }	36
{D So, } {F um, } -	26
{D like } I talk to a lot of my friends at school that are more specialized,	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
Uh-huh.	15
{D well, } that's probably influenced  maybe  (( a little bit )) .	9
Uh-huh.	15
are you still there?	7
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	4
{C but } I don't know.	19
Yeah,	15
Anyway that's what we have,	24
{C And, } {F uh, } we were never much of, -	26
{C And, } {F uh, } I was appalled at [ what, + how ] they were paying them.	24
If they want to put a seven day waiting period, fine, again.	24
{F Oh, } okay.	29
[ [ {C And, } + {C and } what, ] + {C but } ] the thing is then you've got to with screws	9
Uh-huh.	15
Course [ it's + it's ] kind of an inside joke, {D you know. }	9
Right.	15
{C and, } -	26
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
Um.	15
# Uh-huh. #	15
{C But, } -	26
I just didn't find that one to be real,	9
Uh-huh.	15
Do you?	7
Uh-huh.	15
{C so } I can board up their rooms, and <laughter> look forward to retirement maybe.	24
{C and, } no,	33
Since, it is a one story,	24
{D well, } I've used the Nautilus equipment. And the bikes, and stair climbers, and stuff like  that mostly.	24
-- {C but } they've come out with some different ones -- -- this past week,	24
I don't know,	19
[ It is, + it is ] drier in Dallas than it is in Houston or San Antonio -- -- or even Austin, which is further south.	24
{C But, } {F uh, } I don't think -	26
{D Well, } that's all fine and good,	9
Yeah,	36
Yeah.	15
I guess you have to push one, though.	18
{F Um, } I've been lucky,	24
<Laughter> {F Uh, } the only work I do outside the home is I am an Avon representative.	24
Yeah.	15
{C So } how about you,	31
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
uh-huh.	26
{C And } how old are your girls?  <Beep>.	39
Some that may decide not to.	2
{F Um. } Yeah.	36
I've never thought of that.	24
{C And } I am like no <<louder>>.	24
Uh-huh.	15
# {F Uh, } {D well, } # [ We're, + we're  ] going to pay for [ that, + that  ] whether we pay industry or, # pay, -	9
{C and so, } -	26
I do, I try and vote in every single election.   *[[slash error; two utts]]	24
{D well, } I'm not real sure why I got this topic,  because I don't think I checked it off on the list -- -- because I know very little about the current immigration    laws.	24
{C And } you can figure up exactly  when like the eighteenth month of a loan, if you make like a four hundred dollar payment  over and above your house payment -- -- it'll make, {F uh, } -	24
No.	33
Gumbo.	8
It beats memberships at some of these clubs.	21
That's good.	9
Uh-huh.	15
<Laughter>.	20
{C And } really [ from all I can indica-, +   from all indications ] the Iraqi beliefs, if you will, are more similar to our own.	9
Bye.	38
{F Oh, } uh-huh.	15
{D like } the press would get down on Landry,	24
{D now }  I grew up on a farm,	24
<Laughter> Yes.	15
[  Dogs, + to me, dogs ] need a yard, even little dogs.	9
It would be nice if you had full insurance coverage if you  were doing job sharing.	9
[ {C and, } + {C and } ]  they ended up, -	24
Yeah,	15
He likes it <laughter>.	24
{F oh, } {C so } they probably went through the, -	8
{D So } for quite  a period of time, I just flat didn't spend any money.	24
yeah,	15
{C But } they'd treat him bad	9
The only problem is it's not large enough.	9
# {F Oh, } that's neat. #	21
{C and } I made her one.	24
{C so, } {F uh, } I'm very polite [	24
# {C And, }  # {F uh, } you go around	24
It's a Christian  treatment organization --	24
Have you?	7
{D Well } that's plenty # though. #	9
{C And } whenever the cultural revolution of nineteen forty-nine occurred and most churches were either  banned or [ their, + all the ] clergy and so forth were killed [ or, +  or ]  imprisoned [ or, +  and ] the property confiscated, she was safe because she had,  {D you know, } not officially joined [ the, +  the ] Christian movement.	24
my dad would kind of bank up the snow in the backyard and turn the hose on, {D you know, } make a pond in the backyard for us.	24
[ {C and, } + {C but }  ] once I get started, I can't put it down.	24
[ I don't, + I don't ] know that you could require everyone [ to, do that for, +  {D yeah, } to do it for ] a whole year, or two years or something like that,	24
{D You know, } there have, -	26
we recycle, {F uh, } newspapers.	24
{F Oh, } {D boy, } [ it, + I think it's ] {D like } one or the other, isn't it.  {E I mean, }	7
I'm Sandy.	6
[ that's just, + that's one ] thing [ I see, + I see ] a lot more, {D you know, } double income families and a lot more {D like } baby sitters raising the kids and things like that, I guess.	9
Yeah.	15
except for time in service.	24
Yeah.	30
yes.	4
Yeah,	4
lawn,	30
{E I mean, } in other words if the government [ denies you driving, + denies you a drivers license, ] people get very upset.	24
Yeah	36
{F Huh. }	26
{C And } this is money that she's borrowed to form her college education?	8
it was like,  hey, maybe you're still allergic to the dog.	24
Not like she will later on.	24
in Germany or [ in, + in ] England in some cases people in my income level, at least, allege that they pay up to [ six-, + fifty-five ] percent of their gross income in taxes.	24
Yeah.	15
I like to go watch the Giants  when they come to Houston some times.	24
{C but } the questions go a lot farther than having to do anything with smoking.	24
you get # the impression that, # -	26
I guess you would consider that a home repair.	9
Up by Napa.	24
I have a kind of a big family	24
{C and } [ [ I, + {F uh, } I, ] + I ]  have not found one yet that I would rather live in.	24
Yeah,	15
Another part of it was I'd pick one out that was different than what my husband was rooting for	24
I just recently quit.	24
{C and } I guess I had, {D you know, } not really counted on it quite at that point --	24
{C And so } -- -- I was a big Washington Redskins fan.	24
{C and, }  {F uh, } I manage the, -	24
I stayed <laughter> as far away from those as I could.	24
{C and } she came through [ a, + a ] spell kind of thing and ended up in a pig, {F um, } sty,	24
[ I, + I, ] -	26
however, {F uh, } every time an organization such as the P L O says {D well } we'll see if we can work with Israel, then, {F uh, } they get embarrassed [ some, + ] every few months by documents that reveal that their ultimate purpose is to totally eliminate them.	9
[ That's, + that's ] great.	21
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } they're not going to take me alive.	9
Yes.	36
{F Uh, } some of them.	11
{F Uh, } no.	33
Okay.	38
{D Well, } good to talk to you.	38
{C But, } {F uh, } {D you know, }  [ I, + I ] agree with that, because I see people that I know [ f-, +  again, from ] high school, that I still keep in touch with, that didn't go to college	24
I really don't <sniffing>.	24
[ They, + {F uh, } {F oh, } they'll ] dance -- -- on their hind legs each --	24
{C and } it's the wedding season, I guess.	9
One is, {F uh, } two	24
Yeah.	15
That one's red.	24
[ I, + I ] was [ aware, + vaguely aware ] of it,	24
in my family my brother's children, -	24
They seem to be trailing out quickly.	9
{C and } you pay more than just what you would pay for an empty garbage bag	24
he must have a definite profession in mind.	8
It's lovely, isn't it?	7
Yeah,	36
{C so } -- -	26
[ they're just, + they're ] starting off,	24
{C but } I thought it was pretty good.	24
{D Well, } I never, {D well, } -	24
Right.	36
The gorillas and stuff.	24
{F Uh. }	26
[ I'm, + I'm ]   real nervous every time [ I, + I ] open a new can.	24
do you know what he's doing?	7
<laughter> it'll teach a great lesson, because she ended -- -- up [ so, + in so ] -	9
I guess you own a car.	8
I'm sure, -	11
{C and } they don't miss having a basement to run up and down to, {D you know, }	9
I couldn't possibly, couldn't never see him in a nursing home.	24
[ [ [ It is. + It's, ] + {D you know, } it's, ] + it's ]  high canyon	24
{C and } how do you go about it?	39
you have the occasional person who may have been falsely accused,  but {E I mean, } {F uh, } so few and far between, {F uh, } {D you know, }	9
{C but } that's kind of, th-, th-, -	9
Yeah.	15
{C And } I don't, -	26
# Oh.  #	15
To be honest with you, [ I, + I  ] probably watch, {F uh, } college a little bit more than I do pro.	24
rather than having one where they would deliver the children to school in a van or something,	24
-- you're still going to be above, on top,	9
Yeah.	15
{F Uh, } we have two sons.	24
they didn't have this problem back then <laughter>.	24
Yeah.	15
I think it promotes good family values,	9
{C and, } -	26
{C But } I think it's {D like, }   about sixty dollars a week for two children -- -- if I'm not mistaken.	24
{F Oh } really.	15
# {C And } he's in school, # and everything else.	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ [ [ [ wh-, + wh-,  ] + wh-,  ] + wh-, ] + when ] we first got married we were in graduate school	24
Yeah.	15
That's the one thing.	9
Yeah.	15
{C But } -- -	26
{C and } I didn't get it done.	24
{E I mean } [ it, + it ] was really exciting, growing up [ when, + when ] the Cowboys were  really big.	24
Uh-huh.	15
I guess I'll have to take that door down and really get it good.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Like out of nowhere?	22
Yeah.	15
{F uh, } {F uh, } your time will come.	9
{C and, } {F uh, } our recovery, {F uh, } economically has not been like it used to be.	9
{D You know, } [ [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] + {C and } ] they'll clean your fish on a tip basis for you if you want.	24
# That's right. #	21
{C and, } {F uh, } what else do I want <breathing>.	1
I'm in Plano, <<pause>> Texas.	6
Uh-huh.	15
She was the only indian to have her hair done at all times.	24
That's right.	36
We've both been wanting to see it.	24
I'm still here.	24
Uh-huh.	15
They just, -	26
[ I'm, + I'm  ] hoping that this, {F uh, } solo flex will, {F uh, } {F uh, } change things a little bit,	24
[ It just, + {F uh, } {D you know, } it just ] seems like [ they're, + somebody's ] always watching.	9
Okay.	15
I think probably two years is too long.	9
like you said,  [ if you really, + if you need ] that extra for charging tickets and stuff, it's more worth it.	9
[ Yo-, + you ] know what I mean?	7
Hi.	6
[ that, + that ] is sad. {F Uh, } not that we can, {F uh, } sell any great program we have with crime,	9
{C and } # it's dangerous. #	9
{C but, } {F uh, } she likes to watch [ all the, + ] how much red meat and things,	24
Ooh.	15
We've had several here lately	24
{C and } we just never watched  any of them,	24
I do it every day on a regular basis.	24
Uh-huh.	15
<Laughter>.	20
<Laughter>.	20
{C and } I left the whole thing	24
Yeah.	15
-- {C and } again, [ it's not, + it's not ] cheap to rent  the lodge up there -- -- or the meeting room down in the cabins and such,	24
What sort of benefits would you like to get from a big company.	39
right.	36
He said, {F Oh, } hi, Dana,	24
uh-huh.	15
I  saw on one of the talk shows  this woman judge, I believe from Florida,	24
[ one, + one ] of the biggest things now is {D like } paralegals and stuff.	24
Uh-huh,	15
# {C And } I was so mad. #	24
{C So. } That's an interesting issue though.	9
they were.	24
<Laughter> No,	36
There's no bridge area for students coming out of the E S O L, which is English for Speakers of Other Languages -- -- program.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C and so } she'll tell me some stuff	24
{C and } they're sick all the time	24
it windows out.	9
Yeah,	15
even, -	26
{C but } [ you have to be, + you have to be ] aware of [ what, + {F uh, } how ] messy they can get and are they going to put on [ a good, + a good ] two coats, and are they, going to caulk,	24
{F Oh, } yeah,	15
-- {C and, } {D you know, } I'm hoping, that as they, {D you know, } are, married a little bit longer and have children that they may be more inclined -- -- to want to go, {D you know, } to it,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	4
they go for [ the, + ] to play around	24
I like movies for entertainment.	24
-- {C but } we're in a thirty year old  house that would probably sell for forty-five thousand.	24
{C and } [ I went through [ a, + a ]  pretty, + I don't know, I went through a, standard ] drug testing thing before [ I, + I ] was brought on.	24
This is  ((   )) -	26
{E I mean } I don't know how many laws you would have to have.	24
{F Oh, }	26
{F oh, }  yeah.	15
I'll talk  about anything to anybody <laughter>.	24
That's pretty good.	21
and, uh, I always felt that I graduated high school	24
-- everything had to be documented,	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
{D Well, } {D actually, } [ I, + I ]  work for Texas Instruments,	24
Good night.	38
the teachers expect it,	9
good.	21
My mother, -	24
Right.	15
"I love watching these elderly people  come,  they will come and tell her. {D ""Well } I am going for my, tennis lessons."	24
{C because } that's just so much of the way that they make their money	9
I'm being facetious.	24
{C but } they recognize that Syria's not the place that one wants to visit -- -- right about now.	24
they don't know that I don't use drugs.	24
{C and } that's how they continue the thing.	24
{D well } [ if you, + if you ] liked BEETLEJUICE you'll probably like  EDWARD SCISSORHANDS,	9
# {F Uh, } they're # # really nice. #	9
it's so hot.	24
{C and, }  she's from there [ and -- + -- and,  ] {F uh, } didn't really have the money,	24
Oh.	29
{C and } we've got a calico now.	24
it's, -	26
{C So } they get a specific rate.	24
Right.	15
that's <laughter>  ((   )) . -	26
{C and } I thought, ooh,	24
-- {C so } I'm kind of out of it.	24
For right now.	11
Oh.	15
{C and } with his doctors and stuff,  they have, {F um, } a list of doctors that the employees can go to	24
Yeah.	15
[ [ what, +  what would you, ] +  what [ would, +  has ] your ] experience lead you to advise, {F uh, }  if my child were thinking of going to the Air Force Academy,	39
I just feel like a big burden was lifted <laughter>.	24
Yes,	15
<Laughter> Boy, speaking of Denver, on another subject, I've been up there {D like } five times in the last three, four weeks.	24
{F Um, } clarinet is my primary instrument,	24
{F Uh, } {D well } that's good.	21
<Breathing> {D Well, } {D you know, } [ it's, + it's ] one of those things,	19
{C but. } -	26
I don't think it would crush steel cans,	24
He's got what?	14
{C or, } -	26
# [ I don't + # , I don't ] care how easy it is for them,	24
Wow.	21
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
Yes,	15
{D Well, } ROGER was a composite one.	3
Yeah.	15
He doesn't understand why somebody would go to a seafood place and eat either chicken or steak, {D you know. }	24
# {E I mean } #  I'm not all for smoking  at all,	24
[ the-, +  then ]  they can have them play against each other.	9
{D Well, } <throat_clearing> my graduate work is in  speech pathology,	24
{C and } they weren't overly revealing.	24
# {C And } that, # -	26
I know a girl that, she's a nurse,	24
Do you think that in the case of the one that you've actually had some experience with, that the people who operate it seem to have, what you'd perceive of as genuine concern?	7
{C and } [ then, + then ] you really get socked to it, if you don't watch it.	9
I, -	26
{C and, } [ [ it, + it runs. ] +  It works ] just the same,	24
{C and, } {F um, } {D  so } I think one day one of our kids said, {D you know, } -	24
they're like black corduroy [ Ber-, + Bermuda ] shorts.	24
{C And } I also find [ that, + that ] you can send a kid to school,	24
{C but } [ I think, + I think ]  the Rangers need to go	9
What's the criterion for choosing to go there?	7
# You # must have come to Washington at least once.	8
{F Oh, } are you?	12
{D you know, } I know my friends who were {D you know, } druggies and, # friends # who weren't	24
I kind of try to judge from day to day.	24
Could you hold the phone for one second,	18
I like to read a lot of non fiction history when -- -- Civil War era  [ and, + and ] that kind of thing.	24
It's just good to recycle	9
-- {C and } you can just relax,  and -- -- stay as long as you want.	9
Uh-huh.	15
do you have children?	7
Yeah,	15
((   )) .	20
no.	36
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } that's what ours did, same thing.	24
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
They had a regular trial by jury for him,	24
{E I mean, } not a whole lot,	24
-- # {C or } you can't get a # deer license.	24
{F Oh, } {D well } people that call on the phone all the time to try to sell you something. {D You know, } [ that, + that ] try to sell you the [ s-, + newspaper, ] and, {F uh, } [ wha-, + carpet ] cleaning, and, {F uh, } {A what else, } roof repair <dishes>	9
<Breathing> {D Well, } you too,	38
{D Well, } {D you know, } {E I mean, } I actually lived in Beirut from sixty-eight to eighty-four <<voice is echoing to point of distortion>>.	24
{D Well, } [ I under-, + I understand ] -- -- I understand,	36
I didn't know it did that.	24
Uh-huh.	15
-- {C because } you're living on the other guy's money for a while.	24
{D Okay, } currently in our country, especially in some regions, there's an employment problem.	24
{C And, }  {F uh, } <lipsmack> I don't know,	19
We've lived in ours for about six years.	24
{C and, }  {F um, } -	26
{C and } I keep saying {F oh } jeez, I don't have that much time with her <laughter>.	24
I know that, {F uh, } this last winter was very hard on, {F uh, } several  areas [ in the, +  in [ the, +  the ] ] Ukraine, particularly the coal mining regions of Siberia,  {F uh, }	9
{C and } the mother doesn't stay home and cook the dinner -- -- take care of the children, {F um, }	9
Okay,	13
I'm working on my projects trying to graduate <laughter>.	24
{C But } my car is getting old.	24
{C So }  we're in the same, -	24
<Laughter> It is just terrific,	24
Where is he from in France?	39
{F Uh, } mine is a Honda Accord.	24
we [ p-, +  put ] it on the car	24
Uh-huh.	15
<Noise> {D You know, } I can barely hear you <noise>.	24
{F Um, } a little bit,	11
Uh-huh.	15
Yep.	15
{C But } when it comes to what kind of  sentence you're going to lay down, I think [ that, + {F uh, } that ] they should.	9
the credit cards company's responsibility. -	24
I just have one for my son	24
No,	32
Yes,	15
Yeah --	15
It's not good at all.	24
And yourself.	10
{C So } [ I, + I've ] got to agree with that.	36
Yeah,	15
Yeah.	15
[ They just, + {D you know, } they ] went in and took their courses that they were expected to take,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C And so } for us it was  educational <laughter> as well as exercise beneficial.	24
{C And } when they were trying to film that, the buffalo that they used for that scene was Neil Young's buffalo.	24
do you know who Chuck Mangione is?	24
{F um, } I don't know,	19
[ Those, + {C and }  those ]  were several, {F uh, } that we did consider.	24
I said if those boys want to be involved in that they will come  to me	24
{F Oh, } I see,	15
<Talking>  <<in background>> {D Well, }  I think health care is real important, and  dental coverage,	9
{C and } of course, {D you know, } they did <<phone being moved around and making sound>> specifically single them out when we started, {D you know, } that they were going to do all them first.	24
# {C And } T I # doesn't have anything like that.	24
[ and, + and ] the finances, how they started.  {D You know, } -	24
Right.	15
{C and } I play with the grandchildren <laughter>.	24
{E I mean, } I'm not big, {D you know, } or anything,	24
{C but } he just, to me, is not a very dynamic actor.	24
probably	38
Right.	15
yes.	36
{E I mean, } ye-,	26
# it's kind of hard. #	24
[ {C And } I, + {C and } [ I, +  I ] ] kind of see [ that, + that, ] {D you know, } perhaps, {D you know, } we may need  to {D like } get close to the family environment [ and + -- -- and ] get down to the values of, {D you know, } -	9
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } my goodness.	21
{C but } they can.	24
Yeah,	36
{F Uh, } what is it about the, {F uh, } the vinegar that, {F uh, } makes, the crust better.	7
-- {C and } I get paid very little	24
[ we're [ only just a few, + not a few minutes, ] + we're, {D you know, } forty five minutes to an hour ] away from the eastern shore here in Maryland --	24
Yeah,	36
it just, {D you know, } all the problems.	24
{C Because } a lot of people that are from that North Carolina region really like  it.	24
Uh-huh.	15
I don't believe that.	24
Bye-Bye.	38
{D You know, } {F uh, } there were points [ you could, + you would ] make	24
{F Uh, } about nineteen eighty-two I moved from Rapid City in the Black Hills,	24
uh-huh.	15
{D you know, } husband and wife, owners, {F um, } who had never done this before.	24
you think back,	24
There's some nice stuff over there to see.	9
every morning.	24
Really.  *[[ slash error ]] [ At, + at ] the same time, or, -   *[[slash error should be qy]]	13
((   ))  it was not gross,	24
Yeah,	4
Real scruffy looking,	9
{C So } there's always this feeling of, {D well, } golly gee, {D you know, }  you've got to be able to walk in the door,	24
The thing that [ I, + I ] don't really like, -	24
[ I've, + I've ]  noticed, {F uh, } another thing, {F um, } <smack> when I was younger my father was always working.	24
my wife, {F uh, } likes staying home.	24
It seems to be.	36
#  Yeah.	36
{E I mean } there's a lot of contributors,	9
{C But, } -	26
Yeah.	15
I don't know what they're called.	24
# That's # sad.	13
In criminal cases, I'd like to see the [ unani-, + unanimity ] remain,	9
right.	15
{C but, } [ that, + that ] lasts, {D you know, } for a few months <laughter>.	24
You can do that, but it is difficult if you, if you work or,  {D you know, } -	9
{D Well, } that was a subsequent case that we didn't know about. And those jurors don't know about.	24
the whole way <laughter>.	24
Yeah.	15
[ I, + I ] lived in Pittsburgh  before Baltimore,	24
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] they need that, {D you know, }  to be able to relate to other people besides -- -- the same person every day.	9
[ That -- + -- that ] sounds like a really good idea.	9
[  I, + I ] take, {F um, }  SKIING MAGAZINE,	24
Where are you from?	39
you have to watch it if you  go out to eat	24
{C and, }  {F uh, } <thumping> generally, everybody [ I've, + I've ] known has kind of gotten into it,	24
Yeah,	36
[ I, + I ] actually don't like the Dodgers,	24
They'll let us know <laughter>.	8
{F Oh, } okay,	15
Of course it took eighteen months for  [ the thing, + the trial ] to happen.	24
{C And } I do not, {D you know, }	26
{F Oh, } no.	21
[ They really, + {F uh, } they really ] gave [ some, + some ] really good years [ of, + {F uh, } {F uh, } of ] enjoyment and fun and  everything.	9
{D You know, } it's just, -	26
{C and } I tune in to C N N a lot.	24
Do you have smog like they do in California?	7
{C and } it doesn't dry too fast,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } [ I, +  I ] can do a pretty good pie,	24
that'll add one year to his education experience.	24
In fact, she charges us two dollars a session.	24
who?	14
{C And so, } [ when he, +  when he ] started working at T I, [ we, +   {F uh, } {D you know, } we ] really felt like God told us to buy a new car because he had an older  car that was going to need to be fixed and high gas.	24
I think our cabbages, and broccolis and that <talking> <<people in background>> we have more trouble with, that type of thing, with [ the, + the, ] -	24
Right.	15
{D So, } yeah,	36
{C but } it's different staying home <laughter> too, {D you know. }	9
[ Ye-, + ] [ if, + if ] he indeed receives -- -- the death penalty and [ it is, + it is ] executed.	9
{F um, } like soda bottles are [ one kin-, + one type ]  of plastic,	24
<Static> <<dots of static throughout paragraph>>  Don't you think that maybe that's why we had it this time?	7
Yeah.	15
{C but, } {D you know, } # it's like # -- -- [ only use + ] {D like } one person does the work	24
It was the same year that Buddy Ryan got fired.	24
{C and then } some of them are speaking in a foreign language that I don't even understand.	24
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
I've been wanting to take an, {F um, } oriental cooking class	24
Something like that,	11
{C but } [ you, + it ] won't go down.	24
<Talking> <<in background saying Stephen did you start the grill?>>	10
Yeah,	15
but it split, went down through, uh, northern Arizona and southern Utah	24
Uh-huh,	15
<laughter> no,	32
{C But } I, {D you know, } -	26
One point eight times as many -- -- points.	24
that's very true,	36
Right <laughter>.	15
it's getting better all the time,	24
He said, you see that school over there?	24
{E I mean, } -	26
No.	33
{F Oh, } yes.	36
Oh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
[ [ I, + I, ] + I ] have to admit, I was [ self-, + selfish ] as a child.	24
Same sort of problem that happens -- -- sometimes is [ these, + some of these, ] {F uh, } {D like } AIDS tests and such.	24
{C and } the belt separates the aluminum ones from the steel ones because it has a magnet on it.	24
{E I mean } [ that's, + that's ] the key right there.   Potential.	9
that's a good idea.	9
Yeah,	15
[ I do-, +  I do ] not know if you are Roman Catholic or, {D you know, } what you know about that.	8
# Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
I'm sold on Nissans.	24
{C So } it's <throat_clearing>, -	26
It's real good.	24
{D You know, } my wife works	24
# {C and } <pounding>, # -	26
#  [ He, + under # the law he ] would be stoned,	9
Yeah,	36
I mean it's embarrassing -- -- and all this other stuff	9
Uh-huh,	15
{C So, }  we're very fortunate -- -- {C but } <noise> I know in some areas, [ [ [ it's really, + it, ] + it really is ] bad.	24
{C And } a lot of times, those are the things I don't like to disclose to an employer because then they don't want to have anything # to do with you <laughter>. #	9
Yeah,	15
{C but }  ((   )) , {D you know } # -- -- in a sense, you see what I'm saying though.	8
<laughter>	20
-- {D now } [ what is your, + what's your ] child's favorite place to eat?	39
We kind of slowed down a little bit.	24
Oh?	12
{F Uh, } I guess not,	40
{C And } in civil law there, {D you know, } is such a thing as {D like, } let's say, {F uh, } <breathing> misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that.	24
Probably a good way to do it.	36
Yeah	15
Yes,	4
What other topics have you had?	39
I was pretty mad.	24
# He # says he'd rather pay the electrician to handle it.	24
you're not President Bush.	25
Every game?	2
They had one, {F uh, } on that  [ kind of, +  type of ] thing	24
[ I, + I ]  would have liked it [ if he, + if he ] would have, though,	24
[ [ I, + I,  ] + I  ] do it a lot.	24
I don't know.	19
in Kentucky it wasn't hard because everybody lives so close together.	24
before, -	26
Are they good to eat?	7
. [ I, + I ] would actually like it better if everything started at seven and  ended at ten.	9
there was a little girl picked up in Rowlett  [ from, + {F uh, } from ] her front yard	24
{C but } I think we have taken a big leap in the last, {D you know, } twenty, thirty years.	9
you note it's [ only, + only ] a small number of people have actually come back yet.	8
{C but } we talked, # a # lot about [ the, + the ] rituals,	24
I certainly did.	24
you don't throw the baby out with the bath water, and condemning nuclear use.	9
Uh-huh.	15
that's true.	36
{F Oh } wow.	21
{D You know, } it's American made too -- -- which is good.	24
{C And, } -	26
((Push)) my number.	18
{D Well, } there you fish mornings and evenings. And  nights.	24
{C and so }  it's supposed to have a lot of unflattering things in it.	9
I wo-, -	26
{C and } I do not know if that counts.	24
Yeah.	15
uh-huh.	36
{C And } the, {F uh, } software that does the taxes is  just incredible.	9
Yeah.	36
Yeah.	15
Okay.	15
Hello.	6
How about you?	31
I would assu-, -	26
[ This other guy, +  I got this guy ] from New York,	24
but, uh, this last ski trip they took, uh, she had in-, contracted chicken pox first	24
-- {C but } I've never tried any dandelions just to eat.	24
The peace and  calmness is really relaxing.	9
it was nice weather and stuff,	24
they had one with spots on it and something.	24
That's true.	36
{E I mean, } [ I, +  I ] think like half the amount that they cost in the first place.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C But } [ [ it's, + it's ] + {D actually, } # it's ]  kind of annoying cause I've got no reason to replace it <laughter>. #	24
{C and }  [ the boy, + one of the younger boys, ] when he was younger, about three years old, [ got a, + {F uh, } got a ]  nice marker and got up on the ceiling and decided to draw pictures <laughter>.	24
what did you normally do?	39
Yeah.	15
How about yourself?	31
that's strong,	9
{E I mean, } there are a lot of  people who would like  to do it,	24
No,	36
Yeah.	15
yeah.	36
Southern California.	24
{C But } a lot of people, I think, after they thought about it for awhile, {C and } {D you know, } weighed the pros and cons, decided, {D you know, } it's really not a bad idea unless you're doing drugs, of course.	9
{C but, } {F uh, } they would be things on {D like } how to be successful and sort of talking to yourself.   {D You know } [ ge-, + getting ] [ your, + yourself ] in gear to, {F uh, } sort of pull  yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really want to do. Convincing you that you need to get on with it.	24
{C and } they felt  like that would be their alternative to a nursing home.	24
I don't know what you drive now.	24
{C but, } [ if + ] it captures some of [ the, + the ] feeling I have from the people making business decisions that if they failed it's sort of {D well } no skin of my back	9
we had <lipsmack>, {D you know, } -	26
It really is.	36
{C and } that's one of the reasons that I did move.	24
{C And then } that way, we have not changed in, hundreds of years, # have we. #	7
Good for you.	21
It's about the same as Texas.	24
{C and, } {F um, } [ I, +   some of the songs I ] still find going over in my head over and over again because they were  really, {F um, } very memorable -- -- even though my children are now, -	24
-- {C and } I enter things in our little state fair,	24
{C And } I may do that sometime.	24
{C and } they might complain about the place all the time even though it's the best place in the whole world they could be, just because they want to make you feel guilty for putting them in there,	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } -- -- {F uh, } even the, -	26
{C So } it's a lot of fun.	24
[ I just don't, + I don't ]  think there's as many good things to watch as there used to be, really.	9
{C So } they ask you to declare  beforehand what prescription drugs you are taking?	7
I'd say, [ do-, + ] {D you know, }  have one with, {D you know } -- -- at least a thousand dollar credit limit or something.	9
Just like the communist government of, {F uh, } the # old U S S R. #	9
{C So } they didn't have to worry about that.	24
<Laughter>.	20
# {C and } it's # working well.	24
Uh-huh.	15
yeah.	15
It wasn't that bad,	9
{D Well, } {E I mean, } [ I, + I ] guess what I wanted to say {A and I stopped, {F uh, } I do not know, I got diverted, } was [ that, + that, ] {F uh, } [ there's so mu-, + there's so  much ] of a return [ from pris-, + to prison ] that the rehabilitation programs seem to be a failure.	9
go ahead.	18
Uh-huh.	15
{F Um, } if you go further down, {F uh, } you will usually find some,  but not right in there.	24
{C So, } they've got quite a bit more motivation I think to get paid then, # some # of the others do.	9
{C and } she had to have [ a, + a ] computer.	24
basically, is your motive simply, {F um, } health or because you enjoy it?	7
I think I've seen those before,	24
Yeah,	36
Really,	15
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
He will get up	24
Really?	12
There is somebody	24
{C and } they think of scorpions and snakes and sand and  being real dry, and lack of water,	24
{C and } at the time we just had a little baby that was five months old --	24
It's in Provo -- -- {D actually. }	3
{D Well, } {F um, } [ I, +  I ]  think that we probably are paying a little too much tax considering what we're getting for it  and how it's being managed and so forth.	9
{F Uh, }  let's see,	17
Huh.	15
# {D Well, } {F uh, } # I don't know if mine would want to go live in the ghetto.	24
Yeah.	15
{C and }  [ I, + ] getting, {D you know, } real world  ((   )) . -	26
Okay.	38
{C so } we've got our Cowboys here	24
I would say she was five to eight years old -- -- somewhere along that range,	24
{F um, } I don't swim much, neither.	24
I've known people with effectively worthless degrees in this country.  {E I mean, }	24
{C or } is it something that is, {F uh, } a little bit different from that?	35
Okay.	15
<Throat_clearing>.	20
Small P C -s.	30
<Laughter> That's cool.	21
Yeah,	36
they were not to perform in, {F uh, } cold weather	24
they could  make it, [ [ i-, + i-, ] + ] provide health insurance [ to, + to ]  people who couldn't afford it just by the money they would save.	9
[ Russia goes in there, + {D well } the  main government in Moscow goes in there ]	24
{C so, } -	26
{C and } I'm pretty much of [ a, + a ] junk movie watcher by myself.	24
# {C And } {E I # mean, } {C so }  when you're saying quick, {F um, } I think that's probably one thing that your generation coming up after mine, # is # thinking that, {F um, } they have to  do everyth-, {D you know, } sort of, # [ I # call kind of, + I call it ] a chewing syndrome.	9
{D Well, } {F uh, } the trends in the families  were to spread apart, do your own thing.	9
{C and, } # {F uh, } # [ that was, + that was ] a lot of fun.	24
{C So } #  [ you, + you ] assumed right <laughter>. #	8
{C or }  do you mostly {D like } catch up while you're at work?	35
{C and so } -- -- {D you know, } I just feel entitled to it	24
that's great, # {D you know. } #	21
{C and } -- -- {D you know, } that's a good starting wage	9
{F Oh, } okay,	29
We have a living room and dining room at the front of the house,	24
a farmer called us and wanted us to call [ the animal shelter to co-, + {E or }  the dog catcher or somebody to come  ] and get this puppy that, somebody, -	24
Yeah	38
My daughter, always said she would not let me baby-sit because you do hear grandparents complaining -- -- {D you know } -- -- because they're stuck with their grandchildren so much.	24
I never had time [ for, + {D you know, } to  ] sew myself a new dress or  anything like that	24
{C but, } {F um, } I was listening to a particular radio station	24
he's working and working to get this big house to take care of, -	24
They don't pick up cans or the -- -- plastic.	24
{F Uh, } [ I fou-, + I found ] it very one sided.	24
{C so } I don't know too much about it.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
Then there's other times that, {D you know, } maybe the prescription  wouldn't cost more than {D like } seven or eight dollars	24
# {D So. }  # -	26
<Laughter>  He ought to have his own bed come along with him, {D you know } <laughter>.	9
Uh-huh.	15
# {F Uh, } # yeah	4
[ I think that, + {D yeah, } I think that ] we need to really address what we've done here	9
# {C so } # it's every four years	24
Where did you go to school?	39
{C and } you do see such uneven sentencing -- -- {D you know, } evidence of it in the newspapers  and such, {E I mean } -- -- where, {F uh, } it would appear the crimes were very  similar	9
yeah.	36
I, -	26
{C but } it's the same stuff. {F Um, } which is always kind of funny.	24
{C But } it's got {D like } a boot,  on the front of the book.	24
{C So, }  {F uh, } {F um, } I try to enjoy all of it.	24
Yeah.	36
Are they reformatories, where we're trying to take people who can't survive [ or, + or ] [ that, + that ] aren't conforming enough to society so [ that, + that ] we work well together.	16
[ {C And, } +  {F uh, } {C and } ]  I think the people were smart enough to realize that,	9
# Oh. #	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
{C and } it only costs a dollar  as long as they go to that doctor.	24
Yeah.	15
[ Is that, + that was ] it, right?  <Laughter>.	7
no,	36
# Yeah.  #	15
Yeah,	36
{C and } that, I think, is even probably more widely abused -- -- by, {D you know, } the masses -- -- [ than, +  than ] drugs, so to speak.	9
{D Well, } I guess it was [ a, +  {F uh, } a ]  very successful movie financially,	24
Uh-huh.	15
that's, -	26
-- {C but, }  {F um, } {D you know, } [ as, + as ] I said, I do, -	24
Yes.	15
I have four.	24
# Right,	15
{C and } I haven't started yet because I wanted to get one first -- -- see how it worked.	24
{C but } it's running about seventy -- -- which is still ridiculous to have to make  changes to seventy percent of everything that she types.	9
[ we got, + # we've got ] # the dollar Cinema in Sherman	24
{F Uh, } I haven't had a chance to do  any hunting since I've been down here.	5
no	36
[ [ you, + you're, ] + you're ] struggling against your own  body weight --	24
they don't take any.	24
{F Um. }	26
About the only good thing I would say about  that is [ it  w-, + that it would, ] {F uh, } hurry the process up a bit --	9
# <<Very faint>> Uh-huh. #	15
{C but, } last year I was kind of thinking he sure did get in a slump.	9
{C and } he let me shoot and showed me how.	24
she got, -	24
{D You know, } I think I read HAWAII, when I was about ten years old	24
{C So } maybe this year <static>  ((   )) . -	24
{D Well, } I enjoy playing with my cats.	24
No,	33
good morning.	6
it was him, but [ with a -- + -- {D you know, } with the ] beard and all that stuff.	24
{D Well, } how neat.	21
{C but, } {D you know, } jazz can get on my nerves after a while.	24
{C and } I think [ [ that's, + that's, ] + that's ] another root problem.	9
{C and then } I would haul them, {D you know, } here to this place for the Children's Hospital Fund -- -- which got people really going into it,	24
<Laughter>.	20
You sew the bodies and everything?	7
[ I, + I ] think it will	9
{C and } neither of us have a problem with it.	24
{C But } with little ones, I'd be kind of scared <laughter>, to get anything that has teeth or claws.	24
# Yeah,	36
that's, right,	36
# [ he's, + # he's, ] {F uh, } got a degree in business management	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	36
(( {F Oh, } it's not ))  pretty old.	9
I, -	26
Huh.	15
You said you retired,	8
Yes.	4
{C Because }  [ I'm, + I'm ] getting a gut here.	24
uh-huh.	15
Late fifties,	30
[ In Lith-, + in Lithuania, ] [ they, + they ] were announced to be a separate country.	9
Beans like to be near certain types of plants.	24
<breathing> you ought to, because [ [ the, + the, ] + the ] farmer's market recycles absolutely everything.	9
Right.	15
That's neat.	21
that's what is keeping all  [ [ the, + the, ] + {D you know, } the ] criminals in a position of being able to be released all  the time, like this.	9
They want to find a juror that's going to, {F uh, } be most  persuadable by their arguments, {D you know. }	9
that one was. -	9
Uh-huh,	36
Wow.	21
-- {D you know, } when they pull in,  there's a snake instead of a fish, and things like that	24
{C But, } {F uh, } [ [ I got a, + I've [ got about a hundred and, + {E or } had [ a, + {F uh, } some, ] ] ] + {F uh, } {A I sold some of them, } I had about a hundred and ] fifty old seventy-eight R P M records of country and western, songs,	24
{D now, } the last couple of weekends have been nice and sunny.	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } my mom has to take care of her  pretty much	24
{C And } this is a club	8
{D see } men are coming into their own -- -- now too.	9
Uh-huh.	15
I don't know if you have a satellite dish or not.	8
# {C And } it's # -- -- # cooled things # down somewhat.	24
<Laughter> Right.	15
Falls Church, Virginia.	38
I got a Lexus L S four hundred. Which is made by Toyota.	24
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } my. Uh-huh.	21
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
{C so } -- -- this has been fun talking to you.	38
[ there are, + there are ] lots of bike paths.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yes,	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } my husband started graduate school, when we were  first married,	24
{C But } they find that  they are also being asked to do a bunch of other stuff which they think is only tangentially related --	24
do you think -	7
Yeah,	15
What, -	26
Yeah.	15
{C and } we keep on top of what we're spending.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh } boy.	21
<Laughter>  And [ that, + that ]  your children can use the benefits of -- -- that university.	9
{D You know, } I think if we kind of stiffen them  up a little bit, course, [ i-, + ] -	9
[ we talked, + you talked  ] [ about + before, about  ] the school funding.	24
That, -	26
{C and } [ the-, + they ] said, {D you know, } it was behind there	24
{D well, } at that time I was in a, {F uh, }  (( Trenton )) , New Jersey	3
{D You know. }  {F Uh, } it's not to where I'm just so freed up that [ I, + I ] just go, {F oh, } this is wonderful,	24
{E I mean, } [ I, + {F uh, } I'm ]  in corporate communications.	24
You buy unleaded.	24
Yes,	15
{C And } it's not paid for by the current,	9
do you think that the Soviet Union represents a threat to us?	7
All right.	13
[ that, + that ] happened to us.	24
{C and } I saw, {F um, } a guy [ who, + who ] looked like he was breaking into a window,	24
{D You know, } [ where, + where ] we sent Michael the first few years [ was, + there was ] different teachers all the time, {D you know, }	24
Yeah.	15
[ {C But, } + {C but } ] yet, {D you know } we have to think about that	18
They certainly enjoy that part of it <laughter>.	24
No,	33
Right.	15
Uh-huh.	4
I don't know what the answer is to that problem, {D you know. }	24
I sure was.	11
My biggies are the VISA, MasterCard and Discover.	24
Yeah.	15
{C So, } I guess she's very well qualified for her field I guess	24
{D well, } [ th-, +  some of that, ] -	26
# <Laughter>. #	20
[ we, + I ] just started yesterday.	24
# all because, # -	26
That's right.	36
The only drawback on that little piece of machinery is they only got five minutes of air time.	24
# {E I # mean, } these guys are certainly not going to, {F uh, } be, -	9
{C because } that's the only way you can do it, is to have a big chunk of money --	9
On the other hand, they really decided themselves.	24
yeah.	26
that's a possibility.	9
<Breathing> {F Um, } I have a PILLSBURY cookbook I got when I was married,	24
yeah,	15
{C But, } yeah,	4
{C and, } {D you know, } he gets the idea of what school is for	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C and } I know when you  first start out working you're not thinking about that <laughter>.	24
Bye-bye.	38
Yeah,	36
It's pretty good,	24
# Okay.  #	29
is it restricted to certain crimes?	7
we have a van	24
It just costs too much,	9
{C But } I don't know if they really had significant effects in the places where they went, in teaching the people how to cope with their lives better.	24
Yep,	4
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	36
{C And, }  {F uh, } {F uh, } we both look forward to going to our next reunions, I'm sure.	38
<Breathing> {D Well, } there is two kinds.	24
{E [ I, + I ] mean, }  I B M is like, -	24
{C and } they said they thought [ a lot of it, + ]  the reason it was up so was because [ of the, + ] {F uh, }  so  many people are without work nowadays,	24
I'm, -	26
{F Uh, } let me ask you something.	37
Yeah,	36
{F Oh, } {D well, } [ that, + that ] sounds good.	21
Really?	12
Yes,	36
Right,	15
Is it, {F uh, } many other corporations in the area?	7
Uh-huh.	15
that's true, {D you know. }	21
{E I mean } [ her, + all her ] kids were sick	24
[ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {C so } ]  I don't mind doing it so much anymore.	24
{C and, }  {F uh, } first of all, [ th-, + they, ] -	26
We'll see if it's held on.	9
# {F Oh, } boy. #	21
{C And } I, -	26
# Uh-huh,	15
Uh-huh,	15
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Sure.	15
{F Oh, } dear.	21
Yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
Would be, -	26
{C and } this is the  time of year we're starting to lose,	24
that's wonderful.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Really,	15
{C but } [ she is, + she is ] gone now.	24
{C and } he does a good job	24
{F Um } <lipsmack> {D You know } I'm sure that dinner parties will come in handy	9
Yes.	15
[ there's even, +  there's ] bad chemicals in those too.	24
Something -- -- [ to get, + [ to, + to ] put ] these people back in society,	9
<Breathing> No,	36
{C and } I know I don't, -	26
A lot of my information comes from several sources.	24
<Child>.	20
[ We went to Pana-, + he went to Panama -- ] -- when Noriega was doing all that.	24
{C And } [ [ it was, + it, ] + it was ] brand new when I checked it out	24
{C but } I thought, this makes me angry.	24
{F Uh, } San Jose actually has a pretty good record in terms of being relatively low on violent crime.	24
I have to work,	24
[ My, +  my ] mother and  stepfather, and my father and stepmother are all in  their seventies.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Is it, perhaps, woman in politics is for the future.	16
Yeah.	15
They had, [ a, + a ] table,  {E or } not a table, but a desk in this closet,	24
{C because } it makes a bigger problem.  {F Um, }	9
Huh.	15
but now if this is a repeated thing, -	24
how was, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
I've heard an [ interes-, + interesting ]  comment also that, {F uh, } with budget cuts and, {F uh, } expenses the way they are  that it's affected the news media, whereas before they would be able to have a  in-depth analysis or, {F uh, } investigative reporting, on certain topics and issues,	24
If you're in Richardson you'd probably wanted to come [ to the, + to the ] Dallas site.	24
Okay.	13
{C and } he had a bunch of computer stuff,	24
they're grown and gone from home now --	24
[ {C But,  } + {C but } ] there are -- -- certainly [ [ some, + Some ] that, + some that ] wouldn't, {F uh, }	9
{D Like, } [ I, + I ] get night courses that [ they + they'll ] cover right now	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } I've taught in Utah,	17
{C And } it wasn't our freedom that  you were saving.	9
Okay.	15
In our state right now, {F uh, } recently they've had a lot of, {F uh, } {F uh, } the rapists, {F uh, }  murder type, {F uh, } killers going around	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } then I'll get tired of doing that, and maybe start jogging again and go out about three or four nights a week.	24
-ing seems to be [ a, + a ] topic that's going to probably take about a generation to, {F uh, } catch on, it seems, or maybe a generation to two <laughter>.	9
I didn't realize  [ a cow, +  one cow ] produces that much manure	24
{C And } what do you do with it?	39
Yeah.	15
I'm not heavy, {D you know, }	24
they didn't regain any of the land that they had.	24
The problem was his  spelling.	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh,	15
Up in Dallas.	24
Yeah.	4
Yeah.	15
He likes to sing those in church.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C so, } -	26
{C so } I'd like to try that as well.	24
{F Uh, } they're high scoring,	9
I went to college here  and everything.	24
Quite an, -	26
that's true.	36
uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
some days it just rings off the wall.	24
It was something like that, although, [ we sort of, + ]  when we got through I wished we hadn't done it	24
<breathing> they're not aimed at the criminal.	9
{D now } {D see, } [ I, + we ] are so busy with, all of our kids are in sports,	24
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C so, } ]  what I do, is I bowl.	24
No,	36
{C but } we did <laughter>.	24
I don't remember [ one, + from one ] station to another.	24
{F Uh, } that's, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
First off, speaking of air pollution I'm coughing  ((   )) .	24
{F Um, } {C but, } {D you know, } -	26
Bye-bye.	38
Oh  <<Sounds like typing noises in background>>.	15
{D Well, } {C and } they -	26
Uh-huh.	15
You got to make money. {D You know, } pay these players so  much money,	24
{F Oh } yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C So } we kind of got different ball game	9
Huh-uh.	15
{C and } I'm, -	26
no,	33
it certainly is, {F uh, } going to be a pleasure to chat with you.	6
That's true,	36
That's true too.	36
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] you volunteer  for the Boy Scouts, {F huh? }	7
uh-huh.	15
<Laughter>.	20
yeah,	29
{F Oh, } yeah,	36
No,	33
Which Church is it?	39
{D Well, } it's certainly not that difficult to tap a phone.	24
We did that every weekend,	24
{C And } if they saw us watching [ the, + ] something,	24
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
# [ Most # people, +  {F uh, } a great number of people ] now work [ at  various, + at  different ] jobs that,  if a third of the people are shift workers, they won't be able to get [ to the, + to the ] polls in any case.   If they, {F uh, } have to work late into the evening and not get up.	9
{C and } I didn't have any problems.	24
It doesn't seem like, -	9
definitely.	36
-- {F uh, } {D you know, } there are a large number of them on the road.	24
There's quite a bit of activity now,	9
[ we, + only we ] started this last year --	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I heard that in Dallas,  it's one out of every three is actually in the classroom of the educators that were hired <laughter>.	24
{F uh, } {F oh, } gosh darn, what's his face,	1
That's right.	36
{F Oh, } yeah,	36
It was great talking with you.	38
if I had a book of my choice, [ I like  books, + ] I go to the library a lot	24
[ {C but } + <laughter>, {C But } ] we love being where we are.	24
You can't really run away from the problem --	9
{F Oh, } okay.	29
Yeah.	15
# I had a friend who was a police officer, who was killed in the line of duty.	24
[ I, + I ] don't own a gun [ and, + and ] don't really <laughter> want one,	24
{C But, } I don't get into [ the, + {F uh, } the  ] real <laughter> -- -- # women libber # movement, {D you know. }	24
[ that's, +    {D yeah, } that's ] the other guy I was thinking of was Garth Brooks.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Oh	15
{F Uh. }	15
You mean in a one bedroom?	14
very, -	26
{C But, } {F uh, } {E I mean, } [ there's, + there's  ] a sense of priorities here, too.	9
thank you.	38
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
we still got a little bit of the old, {D you know, } Vietnam, {F um, } problem, {D you know, } in the back of our minds.	9
{F Uh, } {D well, } I sing.	11
[ [ I, + {D well, } I  ] have, + [ in a whi-, +  for a while  ] I haven't  ] gotten any because I just find that I'm not reading what I'm getting because, {F uh, } I have so much going on in my life	24
Yeah.	15
I say, See, this is it.	24
# {C but } # it's depressing too.	24
{F Oh, } uh-huh.	15
I bet that's a pretty nice setup.	21
{C but, } I'd love it.	24
Right.	15
{C and } I saw these little Springer Spaniels --	24
sure.	15
you can't do that,	25
Right,	36
{F Uh, } for example, let's say you're taking {D like } an original Brazilian form of music [ and, + ] with a certain style,	24
{F Uh, } I started about two years ago because I gained some weight over the past few years	24
{C and } those were really nice	24
{F Oh, } she had all of those types of vegetables.	22
<child_talking>.	20
Go-, -	26
{C And } it's rice and, ((   )) , -	24
<Laughter> Yeah,	36
{C but } I've heard what a wonderful city that, -	24
I, -	26
Right.	15
I think that's a really good way to handle it, because that way, [ if you, + if you ] paid off every month, you never have to worry about, {D well, } how much do I have to pay these guys, {D you know, } this month, {D you know. }	9
You will take better care of that,	9
{C And then } they called me to see if I wanted to work a day.	24
I think the other thing is that, {F uh, } we have taken some rather drastic turns [ in our, + in our ] education and the way we approach things as of maybe starting back [ when, + when ] I'm number one, {D you know, } and, {F uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, } worrying about self  and not, {F uh, } seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family.	9
Uh-huh.	15
bye-bye.  <talking> <<Background voice said what's that about>>.	38
I don't know  ((   ))  up there.	24
you're absolutely right <laughter>.	9
Yeah,	15
it happened at such and  such time <laughter>.	25
{F Uh, } [ I, + I ] think it's -	26
{E I mean, } it reeks of  the BIBLE, just, [ the whole thing, +  the whole system. ]	9
I see so many times kids just, {D you know, } -	24
I really did.	36
-- {C but } [ they, + they ] {D like } started it,	24
Yeah.	15
basically.	24
{C and } I got a lot of really weird ideas, from that goofy movie.	24
uh-huh,	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } [ I, + {F um, } I ] just refuse to buy it, {F um, } if I know I'm not going to be there for at least -- -- five years, {F uh, } [ you, + {D you know. } ]	24
{C and } I played that all through high school.	24
{C and, } {D you know, } [ [ [ [ it just, + it, ] + it was there, ] + it was just, ] + I guess ] school was not a number one priority for him at that time.	24
# Okay, #	15
{D Well, } that's, -	26
# Yeah. #	15
Right.	36
We've got enough [ without lea-, + without ] a passport	9
{C And then, } seems like every time she turned around he was outgrowing stuff.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D You know. }	15
{C And } of course I have, {F uh, } word processors,	24
They used to just have {D like, }  {F uh, } -	24
# {C and } # -- -- <Noise> to me, that's fine to have a student do that for {D like } [ four + {E or } even a year -- ]	9
[ I, +  I ] agree with that,	36
{C So } yeah,	15
I think in s-, -	9
Oh.	15
[ [ I, + I, ] + {F uh, } that ] is true.	36
{C and, } {F uh, } {D well } he's nineteen  now,	24
{F Uh, } first, my mother had always had a quote  career, but always a career as [ a, +  {F uh, } {F uh, } in a ] secretarial position.	24
{F Uh, } she enjoys mowing.	24
Okay.	15
Okay.	29
Yeah.	15
Oh.	15
Yeah.	15
I haven't heard a thing.	24
<inhaling> {F Uh, } there's psychological pressure against employing people to do that kind of thing although, {F uh, } scouts and hockey teams and ball teams, those kinds, {F uh, } regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collect the bottles at individual homes.	24
{C But, }  {F uh, } I really think [ it's, + it's ] a U N issue, # at # that point because it is internal.	9
Uh-huh.	15
There are going to be sixteen people at my house tomorrow night,  which, -	24
{D so } -- -- football, I love this.	24
Huh.	15
{C but } I was out of the country at the time,	24
{D Well, } the, Uh-huh.	13
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
I've had, {F uh, } one Plano -- -- and then a lady from Brigham, Utah whose -- -- # son # lives in Plano on Ranier someplace. And then, {F uh, } another state,	24
<Laughter>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } she played a, {F uh, } -	24
no.	36
Have you ever visited it?	7
It's just, -	26
Yeah.	15
{C or } [ if, + {D you know, } if ] you had, {F uh, } other musical people in your family.	35
{C So } [ that was, + {F uh, } that was ] very disheartening.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Something that I feel [ is  a, + is [ a, + ] ] pretty much an invasion of privacy is something that's really so common that it's accepted as the norm now, is [ the op-, + the open ] office concept.	9
That there's no problem with getting them to, do stuff.	9
{C or } is it, {F uh. } -	35
Uh-huh	15
[ [ it, + it, ] +  it ] had  people,	24
Okay, Bill, {F um, }	13
It'd be well worth it if you're considering buying a car <laughter>. to find out.	9
# Yeah.  #	15
{C And, }  {F uh, } they instituted a [ drug policy there. +    Drug testing policy ] where they randomly would test, {F uh, } employees --	24
[ {C and, } + {C And } ] they had all these gr-, -	26
Hi Diana.	6
{C and } it bakes up	24
You can usually find it in a health food store.	24
# Yeah, #	15
{F Uh, } <child_talking> I guess the Lord started out with, [ we'll treat you fa-, + I'll treat you fairly ] there as long as you do what I say.	9
[ we're, + {F uh, } we actually have ]  our house on the market because  we have two kids --	24
{C So, } I did it,	24
I either watch the news	24
[ I, + I've ]  always enjoyed it.	24
{D Well, } {D see, } we don't have any  room in our prisons	24
I pay what I think is a lot of money to go to a karate class, {D you know. }	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And then } I {D like } the, -	24
{C and } if you were there.  {E I mean, } -	24
# I, {F uh, } # -	26
{C and } it's just like Dallas area, it was tornado alley up there,	24
Hello,	7
Right,	36
The Kuwaiti young won't rebuild anything.	9
{C and } it might be  national	24
{D Well } [ I, + I ] agree a hundred # percent. #	36
Yeah,	4
{C and } teach them to farm {C and } teach them -	7
{C And } the second one was I bought  some toys [ at a, +  {F um, } at a ] craft fair.	24
{F Uh, } {D well } I think, either my wife or I would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point --	24
Right,	36
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well } that's not bad.	21
That's really, -	26
# You were # -- -- fortunate.	9
he is --	9
For instance, {E I mean, } that's just, -	26
I thought, wow, full time,	24
[ I think, + I think ] because most  kids don't have a car at college, the ones that do get taken   advantage of	9
{D So } {D you know, } -	26
[ when I, + when I ]  went away to school, I'm trying to think my criteria.	24
-- {D you know, } they're convenient,  {D you know, }	9
{C and } two days later I bought this car.	24
{C so } they won't even bother turning out.	9
{C but } I wouldn't get one that,	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
Right,	36
Yeah.	15
<Laughter>.	20
Oh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C so } it's collecting dust right now.	24
It is.	36
{F Uh, } north building.	24
# Yeah,  {D you know. }	36
University of Penn, -	24
{C But } I don't, {E I mean } -	26
{C and } I totaled them all up	24
{C and } it really, -	26
(( {F Uh, } {D you know } )) , -	26
Sure.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
{C but, } {E I mean, } it's, {F uh, } for the top medium of entertainment.	9
# Uh-huh.  #	15
Oh.	15
{C but } they do say that swimming is really, really good for you -- -- {D you know, } for every part of your body.	24
Okay.	26
{C and, } {D you know, } all of the different, {D you know, } decorating tips an things like that.	24
We had to call the insurance company.	24
Of course [ I think, + {F um, } I'm not sure, ] {D you know, } what the time span is,	19
Yeah,	15
Yeah,	15
{D Well, } we're working hard on it because we're fighting also in our area a large hazardous waste incinerator -- -- which we do not want built	24
I do think there's  good daycare out there.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	26
No,	15
{F Uh, } about the issue about sentencing by the judge. -	24
{C plus } <<sounds like drop out>> I do not know,	24
some of the organizations sell their mailing lists -- -- which I think [ is a, + is an ] invasion of privacy.	9
# Yeah. #	15
{E I mean, } it's a lot more,	9
{C and then, } {F uh, } what I've seen of this kind before is you have [[ the, + {F uh, } ] + the, ] {F uh, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
<Laughter> Yeah.	15
-- {C and, } {F uh, } my father had a small business	24
{C And, } [ I, + I ] like the old [ ser-, + series ] better when, {F um } -- -- Dede was in there.	24
huh-uh.	33
[ I don't have -- -- too many, + I don't have too many ] weaknesses,	24
{C but } in another way we're not so lucky because we don't have another woman in the house for my wife to share,	24
{C but } it is not bad.	24
my first impression was,  {F um, } it would be [ v-, + very ] good.	24
when I talk about working on cars  I sure don't do that.	24
{C but } they call it T News and all that.	24
[ She finally admitted, + {D you know, } she finally told ] me it's okay if you don't,	24
{C but } don't retire <laughter>.	18
I'm on the other line Karen. <clicking> <<from phone>>	10
{C and } we had finally, -	24
{C Because, } ((   )) . -	26
{C So. } -	26
Whenever [ they + <laughter>, they ] made that into a movie, I was thinking {F oh, } my gosh if they show that, I'll just die.	24
{C So } [ they hold their, +  you take care of them <noise>, they hold their ] value real well.	24
No,	33
Yeah.	15
[ {C and, } + {C but } ] it's still a challenge being in a marriage and  trying to figure out those roles	24
{C or, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh } no,	21
{F Oh, } that's great.	21
{C And } maybe the Air Force Academy is a perfect, -	9
{C but } # I basically, # -	26
Uh-huh.	15
you wonder [ what their, + ] {D you know, } how they manage to do that.	9
{D Well, } okay.	29
{C and } they didn't e-, -	26
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
{C So } we'll slowly learn just to type here {C and } [ {C then } -- + -- {C then } ] put the story in.	24
Just stir fry the ground beef.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } they do not have any kids,	24
It's just the way the law is down here.	9
{F Um. }	26
Take care now.	38
{C but } most of us don't have the, {F uh, } sufficient, lot size [ to, + {F uh, } to ] do that.	9
I mean that,	36
Yeah.	15
I guess, I don't know if you've  heard about the Plano school district,	8
{C So } they had to wait, {F uh, } {D you know, }  in, {F uh, } certain parts of Europe for years before they were permitted to come over.	24
Oh.	29
I know that they trained you in the language	24
{F Uh } -- -- it gets harder and harder each time an election comes up like that, to make the decision on who would be the best to run.	24
Oh.	15
[ [ {C so } does Detroit, +  {E I mean, } {C so } does Chicago. ] +  {D So }  do-, all three of them ] do, with Larry Bird back, {F uh, }	24
Exactly,	11
{C But, } [ with a, + with a ]  new system I can calculate everything so fast, {D you know, } like for spread sheets.	24
{F oh, } how funny.	21
I get, {D you know } -- -- the news [ and, + and ] everything.	24
Uh-huh,	36
<Laughter>. Yeah.	13
Okay.	29
{C But } it's just tough to get through that first two hundred pages or so.	9
{D Well, } {D you know, } they'd have to start when #  they're real young. #	9
of course, like I said, if my husband's going downtown, he's got the whole, {F uh, } {D you know, } [ the dress + men's dress shoes ] --	24
{C or } they've, {D you know, } <noise> whatever schedule they want from a pay standpoint.	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C so, } -	26
{F Oh, } that's, fascinating.	21
{D Well, } it doesn't, {F uh, } -	26
For sure.	21
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } it tends to work out pretty  well that way.	9
{E I mean, }    [ [ [ [ [ I, + I, ] + I, ] + I har-, ] + I, ] + I ] truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would  do something like, that for me.	24
okay,	29
Yes.	4
Make them more self-supporting?	8
I see.	15
We don't have the money for that.	9
<Laughter>.	20
I was going to say you didn't have the typical, -	24
Right.	15
That's right,	36
I do remember that.	24
Yeah.	15
{E I mean } I even get caught up in it with our kids, even though I buy most of the things at garage sales for their Christmas,	24
Everybody is,	9
I've got a sixty-five Mustang	24
# Right. #	15
Do you think most states have that	7
# {F Oh, } okay. #	29
I'm going to have to leave those details like, what would you do about, -	24
uh-huh.	15
there's very few I would want to see that many times.	24
point seven five liters and then liters and then one point seven # five liters,	24
{F Uh, } no.	33
I, -	26
it's really good,	9
{F Uh, } Marino makes me just crazy mad sometimes, because of some of the stupid stuff he does,	24
You never see one of those punch cards anymore.	24
# {F Oh, } yeah. #	15
They've got, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
Purdue [ had to, + had to,  ] {F uh, } -	26
Yeah.	15
{C And, } {F uh, } {F oh } [ [ the, + the, ] + the ] [ uni-, + University ] of California at Berkeley puts out THE WELLNESS LETTER.   Which [ is, + ] {F uh, } turned into a fairly well subscribed to, {F uh, } newsletter, monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that	24
That's sort of what I gather.	19
{C and } [ they, + they ] read well,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
<Throat_clearing> {D You know, } the first time I brought  her home, she was only, {F uh, } was it six weeks old.	24
{C And } it gave the impression of very old weathered stucco.	24
{C And, }  {F um, } <Lipsmack>, -	26
{F Oh, } El Chico's or El Fenix -- -- one,	2
[ We were, + we went ] on a mission trip to Manhattan and to the Bronx and stuff,  two years ago,	24
you do.	36
yeah,  {F oh. }	15
I took a picture of her <laughter>	24
I'm just kidding.	24
-- {F uh, }	26
Uh-huh.	15
but I, I have a lot of friends with children	24
Uh-huh.	15
I had him declawed,	24
Okay.	15
where do you go to school?	39
What?	14
<Laughter>.	20
{F Oh } goodness.	21
I was on a jury trial last year	24
-- {C and } they take some lay people.	24
{C but } [ I, +  I ] don't know,	19
We've had real hot weather.	24
Uh-huh.	15
I guess you can {D like } raise taxes and then create {D like } job programs and whatnot	9
{C and, } {D you know, } I wouldn't even look at another car <laughter>,	24
That's the jumbo shrimp in the shells.	24
Uh-huh.	4
it was important [ de-, + demilitarize  ] that area because of all the build up armaments.	9
{C and } I certainly see how much I pay in real estate taxes every year.	24
Yeah.	36
Okay,	15
Yeah	15
that's good.	21
Uh-huh.	15
it is, {F uh, } -	26
{C And } I find it one of the best.	9
Do you think he's the hero that he's  being called by [ a bunch of other, +  a bunch of the ] media?	7
{D Well, } gee,	21
# The home # is the key.	9
{C And } she's on the yearbook staff  and things like that	24
Seventy.	30
Uh-huh.	15
You cook the rice before you put it in?	7
You always find something a little extra that you'd like to get that month	9
{D Well, } [ I guess, + {D you know, } [ I, + I ] guess ] I can see it from several different perspectives,	19
{C And, } {F uh, } he left it in the middle of the pond <pounding>.	24
{D Well, } -	26
there's a guy at this particular one I go to, # that # I think that he's really an intelligent person,	24
{D You know, } maybe [ you nee-, + you can get ] it signed up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes.	9
Right,	15
I haven't.	24
{C but } he just takes a few the animals in	24
I, -	26
<Noise>.	20
Yes,	36
{C and } ours is seventy dollars a week plus all activities --	24
{C And } [ I, + I'm ] trying to think of,  {F oh, } Isaac Asimov, ROBOT series.	24
Right.	15
{F uh, } a strange case [ that, + {F uh, } that ] happened, {A oh, it's [ about, + about ] a year ago } was someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine.	24
{C or, } -	26
[ he, +  {F uh, } he ]  had a beagle that he loved	24
{C Because } you don't hear, {D you know } how, -	24
it's about, {F uh, } -	24
{E I mean, } {D you know, } there is lots of  areas where Thing saves the day.	24
{C but } [ I'm, + I'm ] for it for certain reasons.	24
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
getting back to your son's football practice because it really sort of astonished me that police aren't doing, -	24
{C And } the pool,	36
Oh <laughter>	15
{C and } it seemed like it would, -	26
[ [ I, +  I, ] + I ] know a lot of people [ wh-, +   who, ] {F um, } {F um, } -	24
{C and } I'd practically give my paycheck away to do it, #	24
{C And } I believe we'll see a lot more C E O -s in companies.	9
I don't think it hurts to look at them --	9
{F Oh, } okay.	29
# [ I don't, # +  I don't ] even know how we'd pay for it anyway.	9
Out of each child.	15
Yeah,	36
<Laughter> This is so funny.	21
<Lipsmack>  {C And, } now I'll let you say something <laughter>.	18
{D Well, } I know the plan that I had with P I E, I could go to any doctor	24
A certain subject?	28
{F Oh } you haven't?	12
{D So } what do you know about it.	39
I agree because, -	26
I looked at my watch only a few times, which is a good thing.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
<Laughter> No problem.	27
# Right. #	15
<Laughter>.	20
I know.	21
it made you feel really good.	9
[ I get a so-, + I get a sore ]  neck from looking up all the time,  {D yeah, }   things like that <laughter> --	24
I think it's in New York City [ at the, +  at  the ] Gardens	24
When people start talking about programs that help, for me, I don't care if it's socialist,	24
# <Laughter>. #	20
# {D So, } # what is your, {F uh, } family, -	39
{F Uh, } {D you know, } [ [ whether + <throat_clearing>, whether in, ] + in ] the case that you brought up, {D you know, } [ whether, + {F uh, } {D you know, } w-, ] -	26
I'm on the seventh floor.	24
[ I, + {F uh, } I ] really think that, here in Indiana at least we pay [ [ a, + a whole, ] + {F uh, } just too much ] tax.	9
{F Um. }	15
That's right,	36
{C but } most of the time I notice that, {F um, } {D you know, } it takes forever to get a call through.	9
{C so, }  one of the things that he took over was the cooking	24
Yeah.	26
[ It's, + it's ] solid limestone.	24
{D Well, } that's true,	21
{D Well, } I am new to Texas,	24
Yeah.	15
sure.	36
At the same time, it had a story line about people trying to find themselves.	24
right.	15
{C And } they need to have some competition.	9
{C and } she'll cower and go hide under the table.	24
# They need, # the nursing care,	24
Our son, on the other hand, who was about eleven at the time, was, {F um, } not very interested in pets,	24
[ {C and, } + {C but, } ] [ I think, + {E I mean, } I don't enjoy ] paying taxes.	24
Yeah	15
Yeah,	15
how close is it to a home environment.	16
what is it called, Cedar Hill.	24
Yeah.	15
That memory just seeps back in my mailbox.	24
{F Uh. } {F Oh, } yeah	15
yeah,	25
It takes time.	9
Yes,	36
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah,	15
I have a dog named Grisly,  who's a ten year old, {F uh, } mixed breed between Golden Retriever, Afghan Hound and Chow.	24
{C and } it's just one of the things I enjoy doing.	24
That's right.	36
{F Um, } we've actually had some warnings in, {F uh, } Raleigh -- -- {F uh, } on air pollution.	24
[ if, + if ] I watch any news program, it will be MACNEIL LEHRER. [ And, + and ] occasionally C SPAN.	24
yeah --	36
{C but } -- -- for older people who have money -- -- in C D -s or whatever, it must be awfully hard to see rates go down to three and a half # percent or whatever. #	9
we in the United States have more ties to Europe and everything	24
Hopefully within five years we'll be in our own home.	24
{C And then }  [ if that, + if you ] discover the little tricks and tips about, {D you know, } how you get through corners and how you do trim and, {F uh, } how long to leave the masking tape down, because if you leave it too long and it dries it can flake [ when it, + when you ] pull it up.	9
I don't blame you.	21
-- {F um, } sounds like your son has academically the  standing to get into that type of school.	9
{C But } we try not to use them but we end up using some anyway.	24
<breathing> [ lot of, + lot of ] interesting procedural things I think would [ be a good, + be a good ] change if we're going to <breathing> be talking about the subject [ t-, + tonight ] which in some <lipsmack> I guess criminal courts the <breathing>, -	9
{C And } {D you know, } [ it's, +  it was ]  basically all based on oil because nobody -	9
{E I mean, } [ you, + you ] go to whoever you want but file through [ one, +  one ] [ s-, + particular, ] {F uh, } setup	24
{C And } [ that, + I know that, ] {F uh, } brings an eighty eighty-eight machine to it's knees because <laughter>, I had taken it over from a friend who was working on it	24
Did they mail that to you, or he brought it to you?	7
[ the, + the ] diesel has almost fallen into unpopular status.	36
{F Um, } {C so } I don't know what's happening, if it's, {D you know, }  we are, the greenhouse, I don't really know.	24
{F Oh, } really?	12
{D Well, } that's an excellent idea,	21
{C and } I was very very protective on who baby-sat my children.	24
[ {C and } + {C plus } ]  it's keeping his marriage <laughter>,	24
I just saw on the news last night, that they said the average time a sentenced  murderer, {D you know, } is in jail is two years before he's paroled,  and a rapists is  {D like } six months, and a burglar is {D like } two months.	24
{F Oh, }	15
{F Um, } [ they, + they  ] feel, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
hell you can buy a coke or something for that.	24
{C And } if he wants to go to a private college, he can get a scholarship to attend, {D you know. }	24
{C But } the media insight, as you said, -	24
Uh-huh.	15
Of course.	11
{C And, }  {F uh, }  it's just so,	24
{F Oh, } that's exciting.	21
{C but } [ there, +  there's ] no hold outs.	24
{F oh, } my husband doesn't like them either,	24
{D so. } -	26
{C But } Democrats [ are, +  on a lot of issues are ] more liberal than Republicans,	24
It's really sad isn't it cause it's hard  to get them away from junk then.	9
yeah,	26
When they took that big dip it was  because they discovered another big oil well somewhere in Saudi Arabia, # or # something.	24
-- are you a summer person?	7
Uh-huh.	15
you either know them or know somebody who knows them <laughter>, to get to, -	24
{D well } the topic is selecting care for the elderly.	24
Yeah,	36
<tone> {F Uh, } do you ha-, -	7
In the fuzzy logic direction?	7
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } mainly the glass, the aluminum, the plastics. -	24
# Exactly.  #	21
I will go out and [ make the, + ] {F uh, } take care of the, {F uh, } money making.	24
The, {F uh, } -	26
{E I mean, } [ we just, + we ]  got a monster, {D you know, } bill coming in.	24
-- {C and } they don't like to play with me because I'm too slow for them,	24
Uh-huh.	15
The smaller and the, -	2
{C And then, } {D you know, } you see these  little girls in these little bitty things,	24
it's like oops, <laughter>.	24
Yeah,	36
{C And, } {F um, } she knew that I was one of the oldest girls in my family	24
Why is that?	39
I, {F uh, } had a chance, -	24
{F Uh, } {C or } you can have bundles up to a certain  weight, # and [ cer-, +  certain ] dimensions, tie them up and # -- -- put them by the curb.	24
{C and } {D you know, } his kids are, {D you know, } -	26
What kind of dining out do you like?	39
yeah,	26
{D You know, } I can hit a great drives and think I'm going to do all awesome on this hole	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } thanks for discussing it.	38
{D You know, } all of her dreams will be dispelled <laughter>.	9
[ {C but, } + {C but } ] who knows how it's supposed to all end <laughter>.	16
[[ #It's, + {F uh, } # It's, ] + {F uh, } it's, ] {F uh, } plywood, {F uh, } face, I guess.	24
really <Laughter>.	15
Do you ever watch those where they just play for a certain amou-, {D you know, } -	7
{C and } the books are outrageous. {E I mean, } absolutely outrageous,	9
Uh-huh.	15
as a vote.	2
{C and, } we've really been enjoying those, {F uh, } meals.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
{C and then, } {F um, } some other credit cards, like store credit cards, {D you know, } I do have them up there a little bit,	24
they just keep raising them.	24
Oh.	29
{C but } I did not think it would be good that they all do something like the Peace Corps -- -- because not all young people would have, {F uh, }  what it takes to go like  that -- -- because I think it takes a certain person [ to, + to ]  be able to do something like that,	9
{C And } how does your salary deal, # with # that?	16
# {F Huh. } #	15
uh-huh. #	15
it's a little problem.	9
{F Oh, } [ we, +  we ] do too.	24
{F Uh, }  trial by jury is good	9
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
everything's free except for the food.	24
{C and } I think I did read  Tom Wolfe and VANITY, {F uh, }	24
{F Um, } <lipsmack> I've enjoyed speaking with you,	24
{C so } -- -- I'm really into that,	24
The school thing might be changing	9
I do,	24
# {C So, } # they, {F um, } {F um, } -	26
-- {C because } you have, -	26
okay <laughter>.  #	15
Yeah.	15
we have, {F uh, } in California, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
Maybe I'll buy a shirt from G I Joe's	24
{F Oh, } I have a six year old,	24
That, {D you know, } they kind of have an attitude that <laughter>, [ I ha-, + I hate ] [ to  + to ] say it,	24
uh-huh.	26
{C And } I was by myself,	24
[ the, + the, ] -	26
{E I mean } everybody was furious.	24
Yeah.	15
Any novice can pick up a club and learn how to hold one and learn how to do it and do it right.	9
Uh-huh.	4
Yeah,	4
{C and } I got a call yesterday	24
Hurling.	8
# I saw tapes of her <laughter>,	24
{C and } they weren't dropping dead of heart attacks.	24
Yeah.	4
Let's see.	17
How about yourself?	31
{C so } there's lot of things I know to look for.	24
My daughter [ and, + and  ] I hate camping so we go shopping.	24
I don't really know.	19
Right.	15
basically payroll.	24
In other words, while they're national champions, people donate more money.	24
We just use trail tarps.	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	15
{F Uh, } in a larger school  he had to realize that if he was going to screw around it, he could probably slip	24
{E I mean # } -- -	26
{D you know, } some people have lived in Lewisville all their life, # {D you know, } # # and [ so + ] they don't get to see, # -	24
{C and } they were arguing back and forth	24
Everybody,	9
I remember when I was in college,	24
Life's depressing enough <laughter>.	9
{C But, } {F uh, } <noise> they are just, {F uh, } -	26
{C And } [ I, + I ] especially like baking and making deserts.	24
{C but } I would like so much for these Rangers to get their act together  {C and } give, {F um, } <lipsmack> {F oh, } {F uh, } Nolan Ryan the support he needs.	24
you're young.	24
{C And } now we got to the point where the junkyards, you've got to pay them to take something there,	24
[ [ it, + it, ] + it ] was heavy when we were there though.	24
Uh-huh.	15
and -- -- I've learned something from it.	24
I'm going over [ to, + to ] Britain [ in mid, + {D you know, } in mid-May. ]	24
{C and } they said get a baby-sitter	24
That's wonderful.	21
# Thanks.  #	38
Yeah.	4
Right.	15
{F Oh, } boy that is wonderful.	21
Uh-huh,	15
Huh.	15
Right.	15
{C But } there are various other areas such [ as, + as ] farm subsidies that ought to be slashed.	9
uh-huh.	15
-- {C and } pretty soon somebody falls off.	9
[ I can, + I can ] believe that.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I don't like that.	24
<Laughter>.	20
when I was in Texas I had the, {F uh, } displeasure of getting a, {F uh, } traffic ticket.	24
I know {D like } when she has an accident, I know she's not doing it on purpose.	24
[ that, + that, ] -	26
I bought a doll everywhere we went <laughter>,	24
{C and } I think particularly [ if you're, + if you're ] looking [ [ at the, + at the, ] + at the ] peasant, {F uh, } whether he's in Central America, regardless of where he is, [ is his life, + is his life ] better off under communism [ [ or, + or ] + {F uh, } or ] Democratic government.	16
{C And } they run for two months at a time.	24
{F Oh, } that's great.	21
What kind do you like to watch?	39
Yeah,	4
I beg your pardon.	14
<Laughter>  {D Well, } it was nice talking to you.	38
Is there a reason why you have never, Uh-huh.	7
When we had our pool done I had  them to leave some extra loam, {D you know, } for my garden	24
{C and } the other one plays the viola.	24
Yeah.	15
They didn't order anything but the extra luxury version of whatever they got.	24
{D You know, } you don't get all the little differences --	9
# Yeah.  #	15
{F Uh, } I don't know.	19
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
I don't,	24
I know,	24
Yeah.	15
# Uh-huh. #	15
Tight turns, hard acceleration.	24
yes	26
<Buzz>.   *[[slash error]] Uh-huh.    *[[slash error]]	20
# Yeah. #	15
it was great,	24
{F Oh. }	15
that is a pretty big change.	9
Took long enough to find you.	24
she's not smart <laughter>.	24
Huh-uh.	15
{C And, so, } it's not a whole lot [ of, + of ] change for me either.	24
{C and, } {F uh, } {F oh, } we like to have barbecues outside  [ so, + ]  {D you know, } when the weather's nice because in Texas you have a lot of nice weather,	24
I seem to see more women [ in, +   {F uh, } in ] leadership type roles and management positions, # in politics, #	9
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } at this point.	8
{F Oh, } you got your money's worth.	9
{C but } as far as any  formal budgeting, {F uh, } {D you know, } [ [ I, + I, ] + we ] just apparently have been very fortunate.	24
{E I mean, } {F uh, } at one point, at least on a local level, {F um, } going into politics [ is, + {D you know, } what you're doing [ is, + is ] ] really trying to serve the community -- -- right,	9
{C And } people would just drink openly.	24
# Yeah	15
I'm sure saddened to see, -	26
{C So, } [ does, + {D now } do ] they want us to say where we feel about it, {D like } in rating  it one to ten.	7
go to work when I wanted to or not --	24
It's called, {A oh, what was it called <laughter>. } City Sports, downtown Washington.	24
I haven't even priced them.	24
talking on a lot of the things as far as the discipline in the schools, [ I, + I ] think they're  expecting schools to discipline the kids	9
I've avoided buying a new car for quite some time.	24
{C and, }  # -	26
{D You know, } I mea-, -	26
Really?	12
Uh-huh,	15
Yeah,	15
{C but } they, [ no, + no ] longer <laughter>. -	24
{D Well, } it's interesting, anymore the world's getting so small that it doesn't seem to tolerate anymore any kind of the expansionism, philosophy [ that, + that ] was here [ in, + ] {D you know, } twenty years ago.	9
mix up a little, {F uh, } mayonnaise with some dijon mustard, and honey until it just, -	18
{F Oh, } really.	15
[ {C and, } + {C so }  ] [ I was, + I was  ] a real good piano player,	24
{D Anyway, } {D so, } {F uh, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
(( Hey )) , people make mistakes.	9
Uh-huh.	15
I remember that now.	24
Huh-uh.	15
Yeah,	15
yeah --	15
{F Oh, } I just thought of something we have to return <laughter>.	24
{D Well, } [ how does this grab you? +    How did this grab you? ]	31
# Yeah,	15
# {F Oh, } I know.	21
Yeah.	15
# I know # my mother and her sister were both married by the time they were twenty --	24
I don't think so.	24
{C But } he's very exciting to watch.	9
It is, <noise>	24
Something that's going to keep mu up to date.	24
<breathing> The meatballs [ you just + ] {F um }  after you form them fry them in a pan until they're <breathing> {F uh } browned on  [ all + all ] sides	18
{C So } in one city [ of, +  in ]  America, there's as many, {F uh, } hospitals that are equipped to do [ hosp-, + {F uh, } heart ]  operations as in the entire area of Canada,	24
They've got [ some -- -- [ good -- + --  good, ] + some good, ]  {F uh, } good players out there.	9
I love to cook, too,	24
Yeah,	15
{C So. } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } it's really handy for hauling him around [ and, + and ] their stuff,	24
{D Well, } it was nice to talk to you.	38
<laughter>  [ {C But, } + {C so, }  ] pretty much, though, -	26
{C But, }  {F uh, } -	26
{C and } I don't think we should cut the money.	9
{F Oh, } you don't think they got the codes from the U S already?	7
Yeah.	15
I started at one edge and went over,	24
G M, {F uh, } Chrysler announced that they're going to, they're, -	24
I watch a lot, of Thirteen, {F uh, } THE MCLAUGHLIN GROUP,	24
{F Oh, } dear.	21
{C and } they're entered into [ a, + a ] wonderful, {F uh, } scrap book.   And  pictures of new babies and new people who have been added and, and obituaries to those who are gone.	24
-- {C and, }  {F um, } most of it, -	26
{C And, }  {F uh, } {F uh, } we're pretty much regulars at an [ Italian, + local Italian ] restaurant.	24
{C And } [ she, + her ] life was spared.	24
{C but } they have more in the summer,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } I see.	15
-- {C and } [ they  [ don't, + don't, ] + {F uh, } they weren't ] really together with the rest of them, when they got together for such activities.	24
{D You know, } they just want to, {F uh, } help recycle.  Which is, # what # we do.  {D You know, }	9
<Lipsmack> I know how that goes --	21
<Throat_clearing>.	20
{F Uh, } the one that I really especially enjoy,	24
{C and } you could say, fine,	24
{F Oh, } I see.	15
{C and, } {D you know, } I don't want them watching something that I don't think they should watch	24
{F Oh, } [ that's, + that's ] wonderful.	21
{C And, }  {F um, } -	26
Yeah.	15
we're still on a well water,	24
You do not swim in the ocean.	9
-- {D so, } -	26
Right.	15
{E I mean, }  generally in the Midwest it seems to be [ less, + much less. ]	9
Be interesting,	9
tell me what you think about the Vietnam war.	18
# Because everybody's # competing for jobs.	2
is that in, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
I hadn't quite figured out,	24
that's the reason  why we mainly got it.	24
[ Every, + every ] family brings [ a, + a ] dish of some kind,	24
Uh-huh.	15
<Laughter>  {F Oh } that's one of the requirements I asked him.	24
Whether it's drugs or any other kind of, {F uh, } -	24
No,	33
Yes. Has to s-, -	15
it was pretty funny.	24
<Laughter> {D Well, } I don't know if I have  any or not.	24
{C and then } you quadruple bogey <laughter>.	24
{F Uh,} then {D you know} that, {F uh,} {F uh,} -	26
Yeah.	15
part Dachshunds {C and } part Cocker Spaniel.	24
{F Uh, } I forget [ the, + the  ] county,	24
I'll say, Nikki, I'm going to do my exercises, now.	24
{C and, } I hear that, {D you know, } [ it's + if ] you lock yourself out of your house	24
[ it's ki-, +  I find it kind ]  of sad,	9
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } we, {F um, } belong to  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which is {D like }  ((   ))  the Mormon church.	24
I really was disappointed this year when I see any of the candidates talking that they're talking about.	24
I bet.	21
Not really <laughter>.	24
{C Because } I play lots of tennis	24
Yeah,	15
someone attempts to mug me I would ju-, -	9
We have to allow  extra room for those,  [ because, + ] {D you know, } {E I mean } extra space, # between the rows and all.	24
<Children_talking>.	20
{C But, }  when he gets angry, it's always over control  issues, it's always  over power issues, it's never over, {D you know, }  it's always, you said you were going to do something	24
[ I'm a s-, +  I'm a second ] lieutenant in the Air Force now,	24
{C and } the kids when they were young would just go nuts.	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	15
Of course,	21
I'm  clouding up right now.	38
((   ))  you get flashbacks for, {F uh, } forever.	24
[ [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] it's --  + -- {C and } it's ] based [ on, + on ] a perception [ that someone has + ] as how a drug user would behave when some drug users behave, {F uh, } normal, {F uh, } {D you know. }	9
Yeah.	15
{F Uh. } Yeah.	15
In Raleigh.	24
Yeah.	15
{C So, } {E I mean, } it's, -	26
I'm sorry to keep you waiting # <laughter>. #	41
I used to be in D S E G myself. {F Um, } A P D as a matter of fact.	24
I guess [ I get + I get ] {F uh } all mixed up inside. <breathing> [ when, + [ Yeah	24
{C But } [ that's, + that's ] probably the worst.	24
Not really an indoor hobby type person unless the weather's really bad.	24
Yes.	36
That I'm a little uncertain of,	24
Yeah,	15
<Laughter> That's kind of how my husband and <noise> I are.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah	4
{C and } [ that, + that ] includes, {F uh, } an atmosphere in which the child is safe [ and, + and ] he's watched and his physical needs are cared for,	9
I think that we're too easy.	9
Uh-huh.	15
yeah,	15
That's true.	21
an I, couldn't do it.	24
when the pressure is really on when it's down to the last few minutes of the game for the season is when the guys seem to really do their best.	24
yeah.	15
{D Well } {D you know } more and more of them are,	24
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
I went to college at Tech,	24
All right,	38
I read a book that I [ have, + should have ] read when I was probably in high school.	24
{C and so } we have to, {D you know, } go to those.	24
yeah.	15
{D Well, } I'm sorry to hear your color didn't come out so good over the weekend.	13
<TV> {D Well, } ourselves, we have <sigh>, I guess never had to look for child care.	5
# {C So } # -- -- I think there's laws now [ that kind of protect. + That nursing homes ] {C either } have to keep the mentally ill totally away from these people and not in the same type of facilities, -	24
Uh-huh.	15
it's just a give away.	9
Yeah.	36
My daughter got a little bit, not much, only first year	24
[ it was more, + it was more ] civil rights oriented, or race oriented rather than gender based,	9
So I'm assu-, I'm assuming that, you know, they check, they check everything for safety	8
I own an insurance agency, a managing general, a wholesaler of insurance, {F uh } -- -- out in Addison	24
I think, {E I mean } [ that's pretty, + that's a pretty ] important,  {F uh, } part of it there because [ that, + that ] can be really expensive if you ever have any health problems.	9
{F Oh, } uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
{D God, } I don't know.	24
With the walking, I think they said you need to  walk at least twelve miles a week for it to be aerobically <<pause>> beneficial.	24
Isn't that funny?	12
Oh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } that's good.	21
Oh.	15
{C But, }  I think there's enough out there to pick from.	9
# {C So } they don't, #	26
{C and } a C D is a lot more expensive than a cassette ever was, too,	24
{E I mean, } [ it's a + -- -- it's a ] scary world out there anymore,  where your afraid to go out,	9
I never have.	24
Those are darling.	9
{C and } yet they attract as  many if not more than [ most, +  {F uh, } {F uh, } most, ] other cities,	24
Yeah.	15
they're back to glass, you're saying?	7
<Laughter>.	20
{C and } when we moved in there we had [ a, +  a ]  really wet backyard,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	36
{D Well, } you sound like your pretty well passed the worst of it as far as worrying about, -	9
{C And } I kept saying to the teacher,  something is wrong here.	24
patent it,	24
{C so. } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
Oh.	26
{C and } I've always done that as a kid, {D you know, } just yanked on it.	24
# I # feel like it's a treat.	24
just too much.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{D you know, } [ what, + ] {F uh, } you said something [ about the, + about the, ] -	24
{C and, }  {F uh, } [ he, +  when he ] was about seven months old got a gastrointestinal virus  and was just about on death's door	24
Yeah,	15
Yeah.	15
{C So, } -	26
{C but } I know very little about before my grandparents.	24
that's right.	36
Right.	15
-- {C but } they never say [ who, + who  ] they're really working for or  [ [ [ what + <throat_clearing>, {D you know, } what  ] +  -- --   + what, ] + what ] questions are, {D you know, } -	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C because } I have only lived in Dallas for three years,	24
no	36
{C And, }  {F uh, } it's usually not a very [ smooth, + smooth ]  thing.	9
{C and } [ that, + that's ] the thing  I probably like the most about it.	24
Uh-huh,	15
{C and, } {F uh, } {F um, } I'm trying to think,	17
I started a project, {A it's been over a year ago } <laughter> that I swore I was going to finish for somebody for Christmas.	24
Most Churches have the, -	9
Well how was Europe?	31
# {F Oh } # great.	21
<<Takes a deep breath>> {D Well, } credit cards, {A boy, } that's an easy topic,	9
Do you have to give those?	7
Uh-huh.	15
recycled paper  is actually very expensive.	24
{D well, } {F uh, } our people get a lot of satisfaction.	9
{C So } [ you, + you ] are always looking for something better.	9
{D Well, } I sort, -	26
# You have any pets? #	7
Yeah	15
I can be somebody, {D you know, }	25
Yeah.	36
That's the new one.	24
{C But } s-, -	26
you kind of divide it in fourths in a way, don't you?	7
We're getting up in age, I guess, in our late thirties	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but, } {D you know, } <noise> if you don't have a doctor anyway normally it doesn't really make much difference. Because you can, {D you know, } [ if, + if ] you find someone you really like -	9
I'll be darn,	21
one likes chicken nuggets, the other one like hot dogs,	24
{F Uh, } we had all our flu shots taken care of, our measles, mumps, rubella and all that other stuff.	24
-- [ I'm, + [ s-, + ] I'm ] in Dallas, but  only technically <laughter>.	24
either they're really fast or <laughter>,   *[[slash error]] Uh-huh.	9
You get people out of high schools  and [ col-, + junior  colleges ] that don't have the background for an M I T kind of curriculum.	9
{C and } it's always the same man --	24
Yeah,	15
Yeah,	4
Yeah.	15
I live in Dallas.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
{D so. } -	26
I'm sure.	24
{C But, } {F uh, } [ it's, + it's ] a  part of the loin, {D you know, } the rib cage,	24
{C so } it's not always happening at dark.	24
I've only lived here about six years.	24
(( Sound ))  like us,	24
{C So } that's how we got her, quite by accident.	24
Yeah,	38
<Laughter>.	20
I [ don't, + don't ] like that super cold stuff.	24
That's right.	21
# Those are nice, aren't they? #	7
# You # -- -- are you in business for yourself?	7
Yeah,	15
I don't know.	34
{C And } probably the medical care is less expensive, too.	9
Course, the Celtics are always [ really, + <throat_clearing> really ] good, too, with their players.	9
uh-huh.	15
{C So, } [ I, +  I ]  have that at home,	24
It's kind of frustrating.	9
{C But }  [ it, + it's, ] -	26
<Laughter>  Yeah,	36
{C so, } I figured for the main thing it's going to be sandwiches.	24
{C and, }  {D you know, } these people have secretaries and these high power jobs,	24
Got up everything.	24
{F Oh, } absolutely.	11
{C And } I, {D you know, } {D like } -	26
Did you use a textured paint	7
{F Oh, } it was completely,	36
{C but } of all the rooms in the house I'd say [ that was, + that was ]  the one that's been really nice to have <laughter>.	24
{C and } it was real nice outside,	24
{F Uh, } [ I, + I ] grew up here.	24
There are several containers where the group called Cosmopolitan Industries collects	24
You're probably right <talking>.	40
{D Well, } what do you put in it?	39
[ it doesn't, + [ # Taking # , + taking ] one more life [ [ doesn't, + doesn't, ] + doesn't ]  ]  [ re-, + ] # get things back the way they were, right. #	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } I have I B M clones in both cases.	24
I have, {F uh, } # four # kids in college right now,  children and stepchildren	24
some of these are urban worries	24
-- [ w-, + all we ] do here is make transformers -- -- electronics and stuff like that.	24
You ready?	7
Okay.	38
{F Huh. }	15
that's why we're at a point now [ we've, + {F uh, } we're ] adopting	24
Yeah.	15
{F oh, } absolutely,	36
-- {C but } if you use credit cards a lot you probably get more back.	24
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
Okay,	15
Yeah,	15
{D Actually } I always used to go to my grandparents' in Oklahoma --	24
uh-huh.	15
Number one because generally [ if, + if ] they are involved in that type of thing they are into theft --	9
{D Well, } Texas isn't bad.	9
{C and } seven courses isn't  what I usually look for <laughter>.	24
{C But, } {F uh, } # -	26
[ {C and } +  -- -- {C so } ] [ I'll, + I'll ] watch a soap occasionally.	24
<Noise> <<sounds like a train whistle>>.	20
we live in a little small town,	24
No,	33
{D So, }  in Maryland [ are you, + {F uh, } are you ] a Skins fan?	7
{F Uh, } I didn't think that was a new revelation.	9
{C or, } # -	26
Really?	12
# {C So, } # -	26
{C and so, } {F uh, } we just kind of have, everything here	24
I think so too.	36
she'd lay on her step,	24
{C and } on the water pump, it was all metric.	24
and, uh, there's crime in, uh, young people because they don't have ro-, role models --	9
{D Well } [ I, + I ] feel that its, {F uh, } -	9
One of the biggest things, I think that's going on in this country right now is the selling of, {F uh, } mail lists and things like  that.	9
We've covered a little bit	9
-- {C and, } yes.	36
{F Huh. }	15
{C And, } {D you know, } it was a whole different thing	24
I'm not even sure what their interest rate is since I pay it off <laughter>	24
Yes,	36
That's awful <<faint>>.	21
I think it is Raleigh.	9
[ we  can, + {F uh, } on our system,  and I imagine on most systems <breathing> you can  ] just route it directly to the answering service.	24
{C and } every time you start it, from the tail pipe, it makes a black spot, on the cement,	24
{C and then } they'll get to pick out some of those favorite snacks that they get to pick out	24
# [ It, + it ] would. #	9
{C and } we found that we just weren't making the most of what we had,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yes.	4
Right,	15
{C but } we just, -	26
I don't know.	19
{C and # so } I # -- -	26
{C or } are you not planning on having any,	35
{C So, } -	26
{C and } [ I, + I'm ] not quite sure how much cost it  does take for, {F uh, } the judicial system to try and call a jury, whether it's very costly, or if it's something that's not costly or what.	24
{C and } you can take out the middle seat,	24
Charlene was Jean Smart, the blond headed.	5
It just, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
I don't remember for sure now.	24
I don't think's it's going to pay too long when I get out.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but, } -	26
No problem.	27
{F oh } yeah,	36
Well, I, I agree with that,	36
{C or, } -	26
{C and, } {D you know, } I'm glad she's staying home,	24
We have, -	26
I guess the ones that are hard to  convince yourself to do are the ones [ that you have to really, + that are really  dirty that you have ] to wash out <laughter>.	9
{C And } [ it, +  ((   )) ,  <throat_clearing> {E I mean } everything ] was sopping wet inside the tent.	24
{C but } I thought PRETTY WOMAN was a really good movie, too.	9
yeah.	36
I've been here long [ en-, + ] pretty long.	24
Saturdays and Sunday, this is fine,	9
they'll put out a recipe of the month.	24
# {D Well } # -- -- this is what's bothering me, Lee,  another question,	24
{D So } they started, {F uh, }  dividing the kids up so that a counselor stays with her group of counselees -- -- [ # through # -- + -- {D you know, } through ] all three years of middle school.	24
It was like that <children> they thought that's the way life was, that you didn't have two parents at home at the same time.	24
{C and } they all seem to be, {D you know, }  fairly similar	24
Yeah,	15
what do you feel the changes in the future, {D like } with the abortions and that type of thing, women in politics and -- -- president someday, maybe <laughter>. -	31
{C and, } there's just not enough [ to, + time in the day to ] do anything good quality for them,	9
if it survives,   then it'll just probably be one or two songs that sort of, {D hey } listen what we listened to <laughter>.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Oh. {F Oh, } God.	15
{D Well, } do you think [ they're, + they're ] going to be able to make it this year, # past the first # playoff game?	7
This was it,  my last chance <laughter>.	24
if you're having the pressures of school and, {F uh, } everything else, it's kind of, -	9
{C And } I don't know why they do that.	24
{C So } you probably wouldn't  recommend that as a big tourist spot?	8
{F Oh, } wow.	21
By Bly,	24
# On the out, # -	22
Yeah,	36
<Laughter>.	20
# [ I, + {D yeah } I ] tend # to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a [ little, + little ] too lenient.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Right,	15
Uh-huh.	15
[ It's been, + it's been ] a while since I read the Dallas news.	24
you have to, # the yard # to deal with	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
{D Well } life just took different turns here	24
Uh-huh.	15
true.	21
{F Uh } huh	15
{C And } I knew that Clarion was known, {D you know, }  ((   ))  for two things,	24
{F Oh, } that's good.	21
Hi.	6
{C and } one of the cans <laughter>  released entire amount -- -- of freon [ into the, + {F uh, } into the ]  air because he opened it,	24
That to me shows a little, uh, switch in priorities.	9
Yeah,	36
{C but } certainly the -- -- the purpose is not very legal.	9
She would, {D you know, } crawl on me	24
That was, -	26
{F Uh, } no,	33
{D Well } {C and } [ that, +  I think that's ]  maybe part of it [ that, +  that ] the, {F um, } -	9
Nobody moves away except us <laughter>.	24
{D Well } it's like us, we're getting ready  to do, if possible, for an adoption	24
It's, definitely true.	9
-- it's only a couple of hours away.	24
That is kind of an idea.	21
very easy	36
They've won, {D like, } I think six or  seven in a row now,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Just about.	11
{F Um, } {C so, }  have you had any [ adventures on your camping trips, with, + encounters with  ] wild animals or anything like that?	7
{C and } I am very casual and wear slacks and sports shirt and things like that --	24
He's [ pretty, +  kind of ] jazz inspired  [ but + -- -- but ] still kind of pop, too.	9
{D Well, } frankly, I think school  teachers ought to get about ten times what they're getting paid.	9
[ {C and, } +  {C and, } ]  {F uh, } it didn't even leave a mark.	24
That's fun, {D you know. }	9
{C So, } yeah,	4
{C So } it's [ self defen-, +  {D you know, } self-defense ] on that point.	9
That's right,	36
{C and } those little things are back.	24
Pittsburgh?	14
{F Oh, } really?	12
Yeah.	15
{D Now } we had American Express cards	24
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } they do?	12
{F Um, } of course here at Texas Instruments, {F uh, } the rumor mill runs rampant.	24
{C and } this is the way, because [ [ I, + it's ] +  that, ] {D you know, } -	24
{C And, } {F uh, } {F uh, } I liked bowling [ as a, + as a ] kind of a relaxing sport.	24
# [ I, + I ] # -- -- know a lady that lives in a place similar -- -- to that in Austin.	24
That, -	26
{E let's see, } I've done a quilt for our baby	24
our children are now eleven and nine.	24
Right,	36
{C But } that does not undo the ones that were done.	9
{D So, } # -	26
[ We tried, + we planted ]  <child> some fescue last, {F um, } fall --	24
Yeah.	15
<Laughter>.	20
{E I mean, } what do you know, -	26
{C And } I, -	26
{C And } [ that is + it's ] million of people with anywhere from thousands to tens of thousands I guess [ of, + Of ] dollars being protected.	22
You think so?	12
{C So } what is your house like?	39
That's how you got on to it to start with, {D you know, }  what is the matter with this person, <laughter>.	25
{C and } he's interested in, basically, three different areas.	24
# <<Very faint>> Uh-huh. #	15
{C And } [ what is, + what is ] he?	39
{C And } if you do kill  a person and [ it is, + ] {D you know, } you're found to be guilty, I believe God establishes the  authority of our court system	9
huge amounts, thousand and millions and millions of dollars are getting spent, {D you know, } on higher and higher up, on drugs,	9
{C and } -- -- I think the difference for me was that [ [ my parents were, + {D you know, } they were definitely, ] + they were always ] there,	9
They've got the full weight room and, {F uh, } the locker rooms with, {F uh, } a jacuzzi and sauna and the shower facilities, and hair dryers, and [ all the, + {D you know, }  everything  ] you'd need just about.	24
[ she's, +  she's ] one of mine,	25
A time limit too.	9
{D well, } we're just going to send it to  you, {D you know, }	25
# <Laughter> That's pretty good. #	21
{D well, } [ I guess, + I guess, ]	24
[ We, + {F uh, } {D you know, } I ]  think they're a lot of company,	24
You never hear about it really in the big ones.	24
Uh-huh.	15
I do not like that.	24
{C and } like I say we haven't been real consistent with it.	24
[ [ I can, +  I can, ] + I can ] believe that.	21
Uh-oh.	15
I do too.	36
{D gosh } I remember when I was little, {F uh, } we didn't have a, -	24
but it's, it's holding in this, this pollution	9
Uh-huh.	15
Yes.	15
They've stopped that up here too.	24
{F Oh } no.	36
somebody's going to, -	26
{E I mean } his players were constantly getting kicked off the team  because of drugs,  because of, {F uh, } {D you know, } messing with young children	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
{D You know, } [ whe-, + we've ] advanced beyond that,	9
They're about three hours away if you go due north.	24
The last two years,  I have done more theater movie going than I have actually watched videos at home.	24
Yeah.	15
{F Huh, }  {D well } {C so } does she go actually out into a different classroom [ with, + with, ] {F uh, } other kids that are involved in this?	7
Catholics dress very casual -- -- a lot of the times.	24
oh.	15
{C But, } do you do a lot of skiing there?	7
<Laughter>.	20
Huh-uh.	15
{D well, } {F uh, } {F uh, } I am originally from West Virginia.	24
an elderly person can, {D you know, } -	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
Right.	36
{C or, } {D you know. } -	26
-- we never get them at both of them --	24
I would, -	26
{C so, } {D you know, } I think that  [ it, + ] a trial by your peers should be exactly that, someone in your own age bracket,	9
I, {F um, } majored in, -	24
{C and } you play what's on the piano,	24
-- {C and, }  {F uh } -- -- I feel {D like } that [ they, + they ] had that one on one that's so necessary at that age.	9
{F Oh, } I can imagine,	21
I think that may be the key word.	9
Right.	36
[ {C and } + -- -- {C and } ] you just have smoke going out into the air for a day or two, until you can get it fixed.	24
Really?	12
I always have them.	24
Oh.	15
you don't even really have any real worries, because you know that they'll play with whoever's there	9
Right <laughter>	11
{C And } they kind of work it that way.	24
they've actually waited for them, where they've robbed, {D you know, } particular neighborhood,	24
{C But, } {F uh, } I don't know what the families are going to come to now days because [ they, + ]  there just doesn't seem like they do have time for their kids.	9
{C so } I ended up taking on  the load of making sure everybody knows what they're doing	24
West Virginia.	24
{C but } I really enjoy the DECORATIVE WOODWORKING.	24
it's still probably going,	9
{D Well, } we had a pretty, -	24
{C but } I like to cook for other people.	24
[ the, + the ] yuppiedom, # the # whatever it was, the, {D you know, } women didn't know how to go about doing the careers	9
{D Well, } to broaden your horizons,  make you think about different things anyway.	9
Oh.	15
I was,	11
{C but, } I guess, having done this all my life, I knew that there wasn't a problem	24
they have, {F um, } the bags behind them	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
{C but } [ [ they're, + they're, ] + it's ] reminds me too much of an asylum type [ s-, -- + -- situation. ]	24
{F Oh } yeah.	15
{C And } let's see,	17
Uh-huh.	15
Oh.	15
Yeah.	15
{C Because } in the country, people still respect, {F uh, } the property of other people.	9
# I have a # thirteen year old daughter	24
what you're describing is actually a conflict, very dif-, -	9
Right.	15
{F Um, } August, eighty-eight.	24
{C so } they felt that having one guy just sit there and run through it real quick was better [ than, + than ] -- -- having a household try it.	24
{C And } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
they were hiding underneath the underpass,	24
I've enjoyed a lot of his movies,	24
{C so } [ it, + {F uh, } it ] was interesting for me, {F uh, } {D you know, }	24
I think if my seventeen year old, my fourteen year old, my other two children like it,	24
{C and } they just  love to sit and read.	24
{F Oh, } Michael Landon.	24
Yeah.	15
{C but } if I were to go to a car lot and {D like } look at them -- -- <Laughter> I would pick out one that, {D you know } <laughter> looked really nice.	24
{C And } when we got back to Dallas it seemed really dry <laughter>, because it's kind of like what you're used to.	24
Because [ it's like, {D you know, } {D say, } + {D you know, } it's like,  we were saying, ] let's go eat out before spring break.	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
I [ didn't, + wasn't ] expecting that,	24
{C and } they had a maid [ that, + {F uh, } {F uh, } service ] that came in and cleaned everybody's house.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } I would expect so.	24
#  I guess kids do mature at different # ages # -- -- too.	9
Yeah,	15
{C or } their kids may not  be as close as my daughter	9
{C and } I have seen them {D like } go from where they're in an apartment building,	24
{E I mean, } we all know that that's not necessarily true.	9
{D Well, } would you like to be there?	7
Right.	15
{C But } this year they made it to playoffs	24
[ {C but, } + {C but } ] [ it's, + {F uh, } you put ] in a lot of work in exchange for that.	9
it's slow, though.	9
Right,	15
{C and } [ if, + if ] you should have one, {F uh, } that also has hip dysplasia you cannot breed it, {F uh. }	24
I think that's its only purpose -- -- [ is, + is, ] {D you know, } to reduce, {F uh, } the violence in the prisons so people behave themselves a little bit better if they think they're going to get [ off early. + Off earlier. ]	9
Good talking to you.	38
<Laughter> Watch me.	25
That'd sure seems like a long way.	9
Actually, {D you know, } my husband has run for office before	3
Yeah.	15
even if you want to say home, you really can't.	9
{D Well, } {D actually } we haven't had to.  {F Uh, } until just recently.	24
{C But, } {F um, } I guess it's because I'm older,	9
he learned quite a bit [ from, + not only from ] nursery school	24
Uh-huh,	36
{C but } they, -	26
[ They just, + {F um, } they just ] send me everything and pick it up courier or  whatever,	24
[ {C And, } +  {F uh, } {C but } ] based, {D you know, } in terms of, {D you know, } [ [ in, + in ] Pensacola, + in that area of Florida ] <lipsmack> [ it, + {F uh, } <breathing> it's ] what now, -	24
I haven't.	24
Right.	15
[ [ I + really, {F uh, } I, ] + I ] can't conceive of someone being that brutal to that many other people.	24
Kilgore,	30
# Huh.  #	15
Right,	15
Okay <beep>.	29
Okay.	13
{C And, }  {F um, } he's in the Herman Method of Reading.	24
{C and  so } if I just use time -	24
Yeah,	15
it's just I haven't had the time to go to the movies lately <laughter> <static>.	24
Uh-huh.	15
although this was a computer company, he had his, {F uh, } P H D in  musical, {F uh, } I guess it was in composition, {D actually, } from University of North   Texas,	24
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] we go to, {D you know, }  {D like } an older part of town	24
Especially during the Summer, it keeps everything wet, instead of wilting.	24
I think it was like a five year deal with, {F uh } -- -- Pittsburgh.	24
{C but } I rent probably four or five movies a week.	24
what kind of car are you thinking about buying next?	39
{C so } I especially don't like for them to come up to my door [ and, + and ] try and talk to me.	24
Yeah.	15
Right.	15
Yeah,	15
{C because } every single woman in the audience is, {F uh, } about ten pounds.	24
I did press one,	11
Yeah.	15
Go right ahead.	18
{F Uh, } up to a point things seemed to be working,	24
Yeah,	36
{C And, }  {F uh, } I bought it when we were living in Lubbock,	24
Yeah,	15
# Does it. #	12
Uh-huh.	15
{D well, } [ it, + it ] just puts a damper on things for a little while.	9
<Laughter>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
# Yeah	4
{C so } she took it with her <laughter>.	22
{F Uh, } I guess probably going on twenty years now.	24
{D Well, } [ I, + I ] felt a little cheated at Tech, also.	24
Blue?	12
[ {C so } -- + -- {C so } ] I am around, not a day care situation, but [ in the, + {D you know, } in the ] child care environment --	24
{C But } he is being helped.	2
Have you seen WILD ORCHID?	7
{F Uh, } I was drug tested when I came to my job here at T I.	24
I was born in Saudi Arabia	24
I'm down here at T I.	24
{C So } she has got to hire this crew, of four women to come in two weeks prior to the wedding and get it ready.	24
{D Well, } I don't know.	27
{C And so } I don't mind paying for school -- -- # taxes even though my kids will be out of it, # {D you know. }	24
Uh-huh.	15
yeah.	15
{C but } it's, -	26
} I was reading -	24
Uh-huh.	15
# Yeah. #	15
Yeah.	15
{C and } we had made a list of all these, {F uh, }  baseball teams and the cities that they were from,  ((   ))	24
Yeah,	15
{C And } that's the way to do it, too.	21
{F Oh, } I see.	15
[ really, + really ] a frightening situation. -	9
{C So } we both have a secret background that says somehow or another we just knew we were piano players and never got a chance, {F uh, }	9
{D like, } they could put it in one of their  children's names or something -- -- {D you know. }	9
There is, -	26
<Noise> <<paper shuffling>>.	20
Right.	15
{F Oh, } yeah,	15
she isn't at  all.	24
{D Now } how you'd implement that software  wise or mechanically I don't know,	24
{C But } when they're three years old they're, -	9
# Do I reall-, <TV> <children>. # -	26
Uh-huh. #	15
You do tend to, forget.	9
Right.	36
they add up quick <laughter>.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C so } it's a pretty  big reunion,	24
{C And } we were just being kids, <baby_talking>	24
We just built a brand new one two years ago.	24
<Laughter>.	20
She's not ill yet --	24
and, and, and see that's another thing.	9
I've never been, -	9
yeah <laughter>.	36
{C and, } {F uh, } after that, -	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	4
Uh-huh.	15
<<Very faint>> Yeah.	15
{C but, } I used to think, {F um, } Dan Fielding was just [ too, + too ] vulgar and too crude for me.	24
{C and } to me, I like  that, I guess, too,  although there are people,	24
{F Oh, } {D well, } that is  interesting.	21
{C but } then  today the wind has dropped off, and  also, the temperature,  [ so, + ] very cool, {F uh, }	24
# <Laughter>. #	20
I see.	29
SILENCE OF THE LAMBS kept me on the edge of my seat.	24
My dad has been talking for years about, {F uh, } getting a fifth wheel -- -- and just picking up,	24
No.	33
We realize that for the individual person, some things are very important.	9
-- {C but } I [ do, +  do ] like  to travel	24
{C And } I think [ that peo-, + that we  ] just tend to eat, overeat.	9
Yeah,	15
{F Uh, } was, -	26
[ I just had a little, + [ I've, + I've ] seen a little ] pollution in my time.	24
shoot,  I can't even remember the name of it now,	24
{D Well, } I know the family is really going through changes.	24
{C And, } yes,	36
No.	33
[ Wh-, + why ] do you use that?	39
{D well. }   *[[slash error]] Uh-huh.	26
{C but } [ I, + I ] do want to add this to  that, because [ I, + I ] was quite interested in that myself,	24
# {C and } I guess, # no,	24
# No.	33
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } so many of the people that commit crimes don't get punished.	9
For them to have a choice on -- -- if they're in favor of it or not.	9
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } sure.	11
{C And } it is nice on long trips.	24
Oh.	15
{C And then } you hear the chicken jumping  around under the tub	24
but they are, sort of wearing out.	24
{C and then } we're # also looking at it in possibly  getting a mutual fund. #	24
Except we call it Aspen.	24
Yeah,	36
[ I was, +  I was ] better off paying  a state tax [ mo-, + ] back in Maryland, where, <breathing> <laughter>, -	24
-- {C and } I really hate that -- -- {D you know, }	24
{D Well, } this [ [ is, + is ] + was ] a regular, {F uh, } electronics store, {D you know. }	24
-- {C so, }  {F uh, } that should be a lot of fun.	24
[ do, + do ] you work for T I in any way?	7
{F oh, } that's right	17
Yeah.	15
that was, [ ca-, + ]  [ very, +  very ] fortunate for them because that could have really been disastrous.	9
{C And, } -	26
-- {C but } [ we, + we ] [ got, + ]  found a retirement center for her,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C or } -- -- where are you at?	39
{C and } our head  football coach, Dennis Muir <<phonetically spelled>>, used to be an assistant coach at B Y U.	24
{C And, } {F um, } she doesn't think that she  could sit still for three hours and watch  the movie.	24
<Laughter>.  W-, -	26
{C and } it was a very  difficult choice	24
I, -	26
{F Uh, } that can be a lot of fun, too.	9
{C and } they're all like  twenty-one years of age <laughter>.	9
{E I mean, } # I think [ you # + , you ] still have a view that the American voter is different from other voters.	9
{C but, } {F uh, }  that's a scary thing too <noise> because at that age kids want so much to belong to a group.	9
[ I, + I ] would like to talk about, just briefly <throat_clearing> What happened over there in Saudi Arabia in the political context.	24
no,	33
From a mother's standpoint, {E I mean } in a way, [ i-, + it ]  was quote and unquote good [ ob-, + objectivity. ]	8
<lipsmack> making you, <sigh> {F um, } -	26
{C and }  [ the garages were always, + if the house [ w-, + was ] large, it seemed like the garages were  ] small even if they were three car garages which is -- -- what we have.	24
{D Well, } -	26
{C but } most of that, it was done with a sprayer and, {F uh, } up in the bucket of a  loader tractor, or  something like that,	24
{C but } <breathing> I don't know	19
The people that we have that don't come are out El Paso way --	24
{F Um. }	26
{C and } it hurts your arm.	9
[ my mom's, + {F uh, } my mom's ] great grandparents had this huge Victorian house in Paris, Texas,	24
I think that's true.  #	36
{C and so } when she, {F um, } does food, she really goes all out	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
{C and, } {F uh, } [ it was, + it was ] amazing how they were completely opposed.	24
I don't remember what his name was,	24
Right.	15
Yeah,	15
[ you, + from the minute that you walk in [ until, yo-, + until you ] leave, [ your, +  your ] ] competing against somebody else	24
{C But } it seemed like it rained every weekend for about [ a y-, + the year ] we were really into camping.	24
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } I don't know,	19
Uh-huh.	15
one of my favorites were -	24
Uh-huh.	4
Yeah,	4
{C so } it's, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
# I know that # some of the schools  they have, {F uh, } country western day or  something like that one, {D you know, }  or tacky day,	24
{D Well, } I don't think, -	9
Okay,	38
Yes,	4
How do you feel about the, -	39
Yeah,	4
yeah,	26
Just #not knowing.#	24
It certainly is frightening.	24
Yeah.	15
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah.	15
I cried when the horse got killed and when the wolf got killed <laughter>.	24
{C and } the baby-sitter was in the kitchen with her baby.	24
That's kind of curious to me.	24
[ we're, + we think ] books are important around here.	38
I know because, I know when my mother was [ a, + ] {D you know, } going into the work force there wasn't very many opportunities for her, I guess,	24
{D Like } you have a separate account for that then?	7
<Laughter> Five.	24
{D You know, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I'm ] -- -- never going to get caught.	25
I wish we would have just, -	9
{C and } she was there {D like } all winter semester.	24
it's really good public relations for small schools,	9
Right.	15
{D Well, } Eric seems to have quite a few nights where he doesn't have any,	24
Circuit City.	24
I wouldn't have thought that Pillsbury [ [ could, + would, the, ] + {E I mean, } {E or } even had ] chem-, + {D you know, }  {D well, } -	24
in the north end of the state, you've got that  little narrow strip of West Virginia going up between Ohio and Pennsylvania <noise>.	24
[They, + {D you know,} they] say there should be no ban,	24
{D Well, } [ I, + I ] think, {F uh, }  my background is probably what absolutely turned me off with SIXTY MINUTES.	3
Yeah,	15
{C and, } -	26
[ [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C and, } ] + {C and } ] most of them, {D you know, } are working in janitorial positions	24
{D Well, } {D well, } that's what I meant by salt that [ we, + <noise> we ] did that like as a family, little ornaments and, things like that, and just kind of really got into it. {D Like } during the Christmas season, making them up for other people and things like that.	24
It's really amazing.	9
They showed a reporter [ and a, + {F um, } and a ] copy editor how they went out	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
I like -- -- more controversial subjects, I think.	24
He's out of college -- -- and has a good job,	24
No need [ to use this anymo-, + to   play around with this space stuff anymore. ]	9
she's an avid gardener,	24
yeah.	36
Do you like to read mysteries.	7
yes.	36
{C and then, } {D you know, } those, {F um, } two guys who wrote LES MIS wrote a new show call MISS SAIGON <<spelled phonetically>>.	24
{C because } it was woodwork	24
{C So } I have to keep up with them, {F uh, }	24
{C so. }     *[[slash error]] {F Um, } I would have maybe, {F um, } say if it was {D like } Greek night or  something --   *[[sd]] -- {F um, } maybe, {F um, } <lipsmack> on the barbecue we'd put, {F uh, } cubes of lamb or I guess lamb used for Greek.   And, {F um, } {D like } a shish kabob, and, {F um, } mushrooms and tomatoes and onions	26
take care.	38
We've got some land at Holly Lake -- -- outside of Tyler.	24
{E I mean } I just try and make it on that.	24
{F uh, } a very, {F uh, } family thing, {D you know, } made, {D like } go skiing in Vermont or something.	24
Yeah,	4
{D well, } [ [ that's, + {F uh, } that's ] quite a, + that's a ] little more of a challenge for a young man than [ they, + they ]  need at that point in their life, I think.	9
I don't have, {F uh, } any compilers --	24
Uh-huh.	15
That is a hugh difference.	9
<<Talks to someone in the background>>.  No,	10
{C And } that does take some time.	9
{D Now, } for years they didn't have this	24
{D well, } {F um, } {D now } I know we have an ol-, -	26
{D Now, } as far as I'm concerned, I have several other children	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
I guess that was just mainly in the cities there,	24
She'd been a teacher for a while.	24
{C and } that was, # {D you know, }  a big selling point too,	24
we get free products every month	24
I know.	36
-- {C and } because of that I {D see, } {F uh, } work with adolescents specifically,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I'd pay it.	24
{C And } they waited forty-five minutes?	7
{C and } when you want to get out of the country, that's what you want to do.	9
Yeah,	15
# [ There's # -- + -- there's ] no possible way that you could, {F uh, } {D you know, } feel good about yourself.	9
Uh-huh.	15
the, {D you know, } -	26
got them on both sides,	24
I love that	24
It sounds like you're creative.	9
Ugh.	15
-- read my lips, or whatever --   *[[slash error]] -- {C and then, } {D you know, } ten months later he said, {D well, } sorry, {D you know, } I, I can't follow through on this.   *[[sd(^q))]]	25
{C and } instead of spending my time coming up with creative learning stations and things like that I was filling out all these forms -- -- for all the children --	24
We're going to go to Commerce and see a friend.	24
Did they marry?	7
That was fun.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D You know, } he could be this rough, tough guy and then, {D you know, } this substitute teacher.	9
That's true.	21
Yeah.	15
{C And } maybe some insurance companies might start offering it [ as a, + {F uh, } as ] part of the package.	9
Have you?	12
correct?	23
No,	33
Yep.	15
-- {C and } I do, actually, hit the ball better.	24
((   )) .	13
Uh-huh.	15
you see it on the news all the time,	9
he wrote JANE EHRE, too <laughter>.  *[[spelling Eyre?]]	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
Yeah,	15
Giving a different sentence. #	2
I'm usually more the end of the season person,	24
{D Well, } [ [ my, + my ] dog + [ when I came home, + {F uh, } when I come home ] in the evenings, my dog ] greets me at the door.	24
Oh.	15
{C And } [ does, +  does ] your wife work?	7
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
Every once in a while we have these air inversions, the weather <sniffing> -- -- #inversions#	24
Right,	36
{C and } [ [ it's, +  it's, ] + it's, ]  mosquitoes are terrible	24
Wow.	21
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } the whole parking lot's full of minivans.	24
<Barking>.  That's all you can do.	9
{C But } I don't sleep a whole lot	24
right.	36
{C So, }  it's kind of like, to me, -	26
I go, you better be	24
[ {C and } they, +  {C and } they ] drink cokes  and eat popcorn [ for, +  for ] lunch	9
I'm sure that, {F um, } whatever you decide, you'll be happy with.	9
Oh.	15
Yeah.	15
Isn't it such a long running program.	8
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } she did it backwards in high heels.	25
Yeah,	36
{C and } what, {D you know, } -	26
{C but } it never happened, to be a problem,	24
right after you get out.	9
{C But, }  {F uh, } I don't know,	19
Right.	15
those are very few.	9
he just works a normal job.	24
{C And } I don't know.	19
Whereas, {F uh, } I think that's, -	9
{C and } [ she had, +  before it actually got big, she sent ] me  this book saying, you might like this,	24
Okay <laughter>.	13
{C and } I guess all of Italy is not like that.	9
Uh-huh,	36
# Uh-huh. #	15
Sometimes [ when you, +   when you, ] -	26
{F Um. }	26
[ I don't, +  {D yeah, }  [ I, +  I ]  don't ] think it can happen either.	36
{C and, }  {F uh, } the, -	26
{C but } yeah,	26
That's true,	36
{C So. }  I think they're kind of dangerous.	9
#  [ That's,  you did, + that's what you did.  ]  # {F Uh. }	2
what should they get in return, I wonder.	16
<Laughter> You know what I am saying	16
in travel and renting automobiles -- -- {F uh, } in, -	24
Do you go to school?	7
uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
<Breathing> {D well, } there should be some way of checking,	9
It's a really good show.	9
{C So } that's certainly a big problem.	9
{C And, so, } {F uh, } {D you know } each  county has their own school system [ {C an, } +  {C and } ] it works out real nice.	9
No,	33
{C and } {F um, } it was more like, {F oh, } -	26
{C but } I don't use as many of those.	24
Well, let's # -- -- see,	19
-- {C and, } {D you know. } -	26
exactly,	36
{E I mean } they really enjoyed the  courses, {F um, }	24
Right.	15
roughing it for me is going to the Holiday Inn and getting a shower. {D You know. }	24
N C State.	24
[ [ I'd, + I, ] + I ] kept  bouncing checks, just at the end of the month	24
Yeah.	15
[ {C and } people who -- + -- {C and } they're saying that <clanging> people ] you cannot take care of things yourself or {D like } that you're <clanging> not smart enough to teach your kids [ how to, + how to, ] {F uh, } #  ((   )) . #	9
{C and } # -- -	26
{C And } [ if you h-, + if you're ]  a big enough boat to have the little auxiliary motor on there, at least you can kind of  drop the sails and -- -- putt on back in <laughter>.	24
I was an alternate on the case,	24
[ several times, + several times ] they ask me, why are there two bridges?	24
Right,	15
Yeah.	15
I found when I did do some work when my son was young, it was like contract work,	24
I think that would probably be a good way to catch catfish,	9
yeah.	15
That's right.	36
uh-huh. #	15
Maybe just the judge <sniffing> because they're the people who know what the system is -- -- and what it's all about -- -- and believe in the system.	9
{C so } we can do whatever the hell  we want to do.	9
{C and, } {F um, } -	26
{D well, } we usually start them right in the house.	24
{D Well, } I could pick country music.  *[[answered as if to a qw]]	3
Yeah,	15
<Laughter> That's neat.	21
[ I don-, + {F Uh, } I don't ] know	19
{C but } I'm from Plano, Texas.	24
{C and, } {F uh, } it's gets into a pretty sticky issue.	9
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{D well, } [ we're going to just, + we're,  ] -	25
{C so } it was nice talking to you.	38
{C and, } {F uh, } <throat_clearing> there are a lot of things to think about	9
{F Oh, } uh-huh <laughter>.	15
# Yeah. #	15
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } {D well, } [ [ it's, + it's, ] + {F uh, } in terms of north, south I would say it's,  ] {F uh, } [ a little, + a little ] more towards the northern border of the state and pretty much in the eastern half of  it.	24
{F Uh. }	26
Right.	11
{C And, } {F uh, } I just look at it, I don't want my grandchildren looking at me and saying why didn't you do something.	24
[ {C because } I, + {C because } we ] never went to war.	24
Especially in the theater it was contagious, {D you know } --	24
All right.	13
I play some computer games and stuff with him.	24
{C so } I guess we're recording now.	24
Yes,	4
{C and }  they're is just no styling to them,	9
Right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C So } it's been fairly recent.	24
We have [ a, + a ]  very small phone company down here.	24
My all time favorite is WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S.	24
Oh.	15
Somehow that just seems weird to me <laughter>.	24
it's a way for me to stay home.	24
just, -	26
{C and }  ((   )) . -	26
Okay.	29
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
and we had a well,	24
{C and } I bought a Martha Stewart,	24
I think, probably [ your, +  a great deal of what you ] say  is true about the legals.	36
he's not that far,	24
{C and } then we kick the ball.	24
-- it's probably fairly typical, cream cheese and egg and sugar, and the insides of a, -	24
# <Laughter>.  #	20
{C And so } what I did, I switched to liquid,	24
{C and }  he's suave	24
{C But } I think it ought to be expanded to include children.	9
{E I mean } they came in and up and  out	24
Right.	15
"should begin.  *[[listen; could probably code if we could tell if it said ""we"" or ""you""]]"	13
{E I mean, } {D you know, } Tom is just always saying, what a mystery you are, {D you know } <laughter>, {D you know. }	9
Yeah.	15
What are they?	39
{D so, } -	26
{C and } # [ it was, + {F uh, } it was ] funny, I tell you.	24
{D Well, } especially don't you have what, a lot of salt on the ground?	7
Yeah,	15
Wow.	21
I did it by hand,	24
Yeah.	15
{C But } it's really good,	24
I could eat all day and not gain an ounce <laughter>.	24
that's great.	21
{C And, } {F uh, } if they were local  people, they would have been able to find him.	9
Yeah.	15
{D Well } [ [ [ it's, + it, ] +  it, ] +    {D yeah, } it's ] a little bit like any other sport, {D you know. }	9
They have mostly small mouth in them	8
Right.	15
{C but } [ people that, + the people that ] own them are the [ hom-, + homes ] themselves,	9
I really like ((   ))  a lot, -	24
{C and } there was just a freak snowfall early one morning in December [ be-, + couple days before  ] Christmas.	24
Are you there in school?	7
yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
White.	30
# That's # the way I am.	24
{C and } if I have to go take art classes, {D you know, } I'm not going to use them.	24
{C but } I think I'm too old now,	24
{C And } a lot of his problems had to do with money mostly.	24
{C And } [ he goes to, +  no Guatemala, because he goes to ] virgo church  in Guatemala City.	9
<laughter>.	20
I think if I had to come home and then go somewhere, I'd never make it.	24
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah,	36
Woke up and had snack time, {D you know, }  and then hugged each other as we left.	24
{C and } you're actually my first call.	24
-- {C and, }  {F uh, } it's been kind of nice,	24
{C and } we normally manage to eat out once a week anyway.	24
Hi.	6
Uh-huh.	15
There you go.	36
it looks -- -- quite formal.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Now, } if he comes in and says, {D you know, } I'll repair [ your, + your ] V C R, or somebody else's V C R, for a hundred dollars, gets in there, -	24
<Laughter>.	20
<child_talking>.  {C And } I, -	26
<Static> Yeah.	15
{D Actually } I just, put a, {F uh, } little fence around my yard, {F uh, } {F um, } which is I suppose, technically illegal,	24
{C And } they even picked up our,  {F uh, } Styrofoam [ pl-, +  packing ] materials.	24
<laughter> That's the kind I like. <laughter>	24
now that Steve Largent is gone, I kind of lose a little bit for them	24
I like just about anything.	24
{C And } I have four children, {D you know, }	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C so, }  {F uh, } <sniffing> yeah,	26
<Cough>  <<sounds like a light cough>>.	20
and, {F uh, } have it punched in on those little cardboard cards <laughter> which, # I don't # think exists anymore.	24
{C although } in my case I might have been more, {F uh, } sympathetic with the person who got caught,	9
You did?	7
Uh, which helps out a lot as far as that goes.	24
"{C and } as soon as the front came over, it was calm.  So you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle <breathing>    *[[ Seems that a new slash unit should start with ""So . . ."" ]]"	24
Right.	15
Uh-huh,	36
it takes us about a year to save up enough to be [ worth, + {D you know, } worth ] bothering to go in and do,	24
# <Lipsmack> Yeah. #	15
the ones at the grocery store, half the time, they've pulled the lid off	24
I know what you are saying.	24
{F Oh, }  (( are you ))  <laughter>.	15
Do you think there should be drug testing for political officials?	7
Right,	11
((   ))  are the lines that come from her.	24
Yeah.	15
{C And } you are trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone,	24
(( Yeah )) ,	15
{C And, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } [ I, + I've, ] in hindsight,  seen some things that I wished that, {D you know, } I had done  something about that was, {D you know, } within my power  or, {F uh, } {D you know, } wish that in some ways we,  as parents, had more control over -- -- what's happening up there, {D you know, } type thing.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah	36
what, -	26
{C So } that's, {D you know, } -	26
some people say go to New York,	24
{D Well, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I'm ] living in a dream world,	24
Uh-huh.	36
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] you measure, {D you know, }	9
{E I mean } obviously you can look at it and say {D well, } {D anyway. } -	9
it's sort of funny,	38
{C so } I'll get another week when I hit fifteen.	24
Yeah,	15
{C so } to me, {D see }  that would be [ [ the, + the, ] + {F uh, } the ] greatest time for, {F um, } {D you know, } teenagers [ to, + to ]  do that, would be right after they graduated from high school.	9
Yeah.	26
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	15
it would take quite a   few people.	9
{C and } I thought I had seen,   when we were traveling around the state,  some similar signs up that indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up	24
<laughter> {C but } it's fun. {D You know, }	24
{C but } {F uh, }  [ you get all sorts, + you get [ all, + all  ] sorts  ] of things, {F uh, } in the schools, {F uh, } {F uh, }	9
Yeah.	15
{C And } I always check them off and, {D you know, } check my balance and my book [ and, + ] {D you know, } because I always want to know exactly what I have, {D you know. }	24
Right.	15
-- I don't want a lot of thinking <laughter>.	24
{C and } I really don't feel much {D like } the Soviet  Union itself is a threat anymore.	9
Uh-huh.	15
he was in prison for, {F um, } sexually assaulting two children.	24
<Child> Yeah.	15
{C and } they say, boy, six months out of the year it's bitter cold, [ and -- + -- and ] the wind and the blowing snow and everything.	24
{F Um, } {C and } that's, -	26
they love to sit in front of the T V,	24
Yeah.	15
Mostly I use it for writing papers and things like that.	24
{C and } [ we've got, +  there's ] two gates that go into the back  yard	24
{C and, }  after [ I, + I ] graduated, I read some of the old classics that I just bluffed my way through -- -- and have found that I enjoy them quite a bit, too, {F uh, }	24
It just, -	26
Well, it was really nice talking to you.	38
Uh-huh,	15
No.	15
Yeah.	4
{D Well, } I did for many years.	24
{F Oh, } are you?	12
Okay.	38
I think part of that, -	9
Right,	15
{C but } it's about half way   between the Spring Creek and [ the, + the ] Dallas site.	24
Have you seen that one yet?	7
It's was nice talking to you Kathleen.	38
{C And } it's not as boring if you get several people --	9
Good,	21
# [ It's, + # # Yeah,	26
That's why we came out here.	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	36
# Oh,	15
Last week going to the airport,	24
bye.	38
my telephone and I don't like the [ wa-, + way  ] telephone numbers can be used.	24
{C and } that's pretty good.	24
{F Oh, } no.	21
{F Uh, } {D well } I just have an opinion,	24
{C and so } it was a matter of somebody had to have a  ((   ))  <laughter> job.	24
Uh-huh.	15
some of them I already knew about,	24
{C So, }  I do know about that program	24
{D You know, } {D like } I just kind of stay up on it	24
{F Uh, } the  parents usually took out [ time, + {F uh, } {D you know, } more time ] than  they do now to come with the children and just spend the day doing a family  activity.	9
The, -	26
good deal --	21
when I do recipes I just throw stuff in.	24
{C and } there is no long-term disability policy.	24
Car batteries.	24
I would say.	21
Why,	16
I haven't seen it in a long time.	24
{F Uh, } yeah,	36
I don't blame you.	21
<sniffing>. {F Uh, } yeah.	15
{C so } then # -- -- they eat a pizza or <laughter>. -	24
{F Oh, } have you?	12
# [ I know, + # # I know ] they don't. #	24
{E I mean, } sometimes it's good to have a bigger family because it does make you more independent.	9
that was a real, -	26
{C And } everybody wanted Rin Tin Tin.	24
by all means.	21
Yeah,	15
{C and } their veal dishes have been good.	24
Right.	15
Yeah.	15
{D Now } was that just on handguns or was that on  rifles?	7
{C and } I'm  not sure [ where, +   what  ] she does.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	4
I don't believe that very often happens.	9
{D Well, } I agree that it's a big task,	36
<<Spoken off phone>>.  What you want.	10
Yeah.	15
<laughter>.  Something like that.	24
{C and } it would be like  two dollars -- -- {C but } since last time we've gotten more like a dollar.	24
Uh-huh,	36
yeah.	15
-- [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] I, -	26
{C But } -- -- it is very warm here, which is typical for this [ part of the, + time of the ] year.	24
# {C So } it all # comes filtering down to us all [ in-, + individually. ]	9
Uh, our children are both, uh, basically adults.	24
right.  # *[[needs slash unit]] {F Oh, } I'm sure,	15
{C And, } {F uh, } I stay home.	24
{C And } have, {D you know, }  {D like } three or four couples come over,	24
it's not feasible to do everyone,	9
{C And } I'm thankful I have two girls, because they're in bunk beds,	24
you can  never count the Celtics out # when Larry  Bird's, # starting to click on all cylinders.	9
My parents just live, {F uh, } thirty miles south of Denver	24
{F Uh, } primarily because [ it, + it ]  seems to be a little more, {F uh, } {D well, } let's say -- -	24
[ that's -- -- my, + that's my ] parties mostly  is at Christmas time and Thanksgiving time.	24
{C And } when, {F uh, } difficult  decisions, {F uh, } are made, {F uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, } they generally prove out to be right by things that occur later on.	9
{C and, }  {F uh, } there would be more honest settlements instead of this, {F uh, } tugging of people's heart strings and, {F uh } -- -- making them cry and feel like they're doing somebody good by # [ giving them # -- -- + {E or }  giving them ] two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering <sniffing>.	9
[ {C and, } + <talking> {C and } ] the two cars that apparently are close to that.  That actually have high reliability, the Taurus is one of the highest U S cars.	24
you ever seen [ the, + the ] starter bread,	7
{D See } now I haven't so that, -	24
Okay.	15
{C and } it pays you to use it. # {E I mean, } # if you pay your bill off right away, # if you # don't ever have to pay  any interest on it because they give you a certain amount every time that you use it,	24
Yeah,	36
-- {C and } I look back at it and say jeez, {D you know, }	24
uh-huh.	36
I went to U T at Austin.	24
How many, {F uh. }	39
it was <breathing> their winter	24

{C And } Dallas is pretty, {F uh, }	24
they see that.	9
{C so } [ it, + it ] takes me awhile to get to the hole	24
they seem to be losing their common sense over the issue.	9
{D Well, } what was her name?	39
Oh.	15
Yes.	4
Uh-huh.	15
{D You know, } {C and } you think to yourself, {F oh, } my goodness, Eisenhower <laughter>.	9
Yeah.	15
{C but } [ they, + ] {D you know, }  if they learn the job and they can go into graduate school -- -- usually a company, [ it will, + if it's worth it's weight,  will ] subsidize,	9
Okay.	36
that's good.	21
# That's cold water around there.  #	24
{C but } it's about the only thing that keeps my mobility [ in sh-, +  in there, ]	24
{F Oh, } I see.	15
{C and } that was the reason	24
# That's right. #	36
I wasn't sure that they were blaming that [ sp-, + space ] disaster on one company.	9
{C and} just like you say,	24
All week.	30
unless they're at a point where they're mentally -- -- incapacitated <static>.	9
Uh-huh.	15
-- {C and } I think that's the only reason I have a problem with it, when [ there's no, + {D you know, } there's no ] reason -- -- to suspect someone, {D you know. }	9
Oh.	15
{F Uh, }  they can declare anything they want	9
Uh-huh.	15
<Laughter> Right.	15
{C and } I stopped payment on  the check,	24
{F Oh, } okay.	29
{C or, } -	26
{D see } my car was also a two door.	24
{C But } excellent acting by Billy Crystal and -- Bruno Kirby,	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ you, + you ] -	26
Right.	15
yeah.	36
One, -	26
{F Uh, } two, actually --	24
[ I, + I ] remember seeing the video of it on M T V,	24
# Yeah, #	15
[ {C and, } +  {C and, } ] -	26
{F Uh, } <throat_clearing> {D well, } I like to be  entertained once in a while	24
you're not going to payoff what you owe,	9
Yeah.	36
{C and } I think that is so important.	9
Here in Indiana [ we pay, + {F uh, } we pay ] county income tax, state income tax,	24
I just, # don't think that, {F uh, } you can rehabilitate,	9
Yeah,	15
{D Well } not that we could be bought,	9
{F Uh, } that's great.	21
# Uh-huh. #	15
my twelve year old got out the Legos -- -- which of course he hasn't touched since last summer --	24
{F Oh } yeah.	15
{F Uh, } no.	33
{C but } I don't really know.	24
Yeah.	15
We really could use a little positive motivation --	9
{C and, } -	26
# Yeah. #	15
{C and } those kind of people, I'm sorry,  you don't reform them, {D you know, }	9
Me <laughter>.	2
yeah.	15
Great,	21
{F Uh, } mainly, [ the, + the ] books I read are, {F uh, } business related, or self improvement.	24
<Inhaling>.	20
A high percentage of, {F uh, } free time, -	26
# Yeah	15
[ I, + I ] think that eventually [ the, + the ] family unit's just not going to even exist anymore.	9
I used to work for the power company here	24
Uh-huh.	15
# {F Oh, } # really.	15
I can throw, -	24
Yeah.	36
What else has changed between the sixties and the eighties -- -- # and # the nineties?	16
{C and } we like to play {D like } kick ball and softball and stuff.	24
{F Uh, } [ I, + I ] really enjoy it,	24
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah.	15
So that they're sure that  you haven't borrowed anybody's, I guess, or something.	24
{D Well, } what are the colors in your house?	39
Bye-bye.	38
yeah.	15
[ Just, + {D you know, } just ] {D like } sewing and stuff and decided to buy a pattern and  try to make a doll.	24
{D Well, } I would say the Saints  [ (( after )) +  , (( since ))  ] , -	9
Okay.	15
but on the trip down and back I filled up both coming and going	24
{C So } [ I, + I ] think of it, {D Well, } how would I want to be treated -- -- rather than, {D well, } -	24
-- {C and } being able to go with them to  [ so-, +  at least some ] of them -- -- gave me a chance to explain things  to them  [ and to, + ] {F uh, } in reference to what we had seen.	24
{C and } sometimes my son does it.	24
(( yeah )) . #	15
That's about all.	24
Uh-huh,	36
Yeah,	15
<Noise>.	20
Uh-huh.	26
{C and } it's kind of like cancer.	9
{C And then } [ he learned he, + he also learned ]  that, {F uh, } there were times that you had to be gone, so you   probably minimized, -	24
I graduated from college with my bachelor's degree in nineteen sixty-four.	24
I feel really bad that it's turned so much -- -- # to where the children # are, # {F uh, } # -	9
You can just go in  there and join just like anywhere else too.	24
Not just a couple.	9
Uh-huh.	15
<Laughter> Oh.	15
# Uh-huh. #	15
In fact, I just talked to the director awhile ago,	38
Why,	31
Have [ you ever had a, + {F uh, } {A it's kind of slightly off the subject, but } you ever had [ a, + {F uh, } a ] ] blood workup done recently or since you've been biking, to see if it, -	7
{F uh, } my dad lives in the state capital, which is Pierre --	24
It works great.	36
Uh-huh.	15
-- they kind of came out looking like gourds.	24
flat, dry -- -- and dirty,	24
we have random drug testing [ at, + in ] my business,	24
Huh.	15
{F Oh, } I have a few times.	24
How about you?	31
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
<Laughter> Six years.	24
{C so } <laughter>. -	26
{F Oh, } that's good.	21
(( {C but } it almost ))  doesn't look like it's almost livable	9
{D Well, } I really do.	11
Yes.	15
that's why [ I, +  I ] really miss it.	24
Oh.	15
No,	36
{C or, } {D you know, } I can't think of ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who was being robbed	9
[ {C so, } + {C so } ] # [  if, + if ] William Kennedy Smith had been found guilty, you believe he should have been, {F uh, } executed?	8
{F Oh, } gee. Yeah.	21
{C and so } I guess I do not mind too much when they do watch a little bit.	24
That make sense?	13
They need health care	24
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] the one person I know that has one, [ they, + they ] feel guilty.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } boy.	21
{D Well, } [ [ I, +  I, ] + whenever I ]  do it, I feel [ good. + {E I mean } good ] that I have done,  good because [ it's, +  it seems ] right and good because it has good effects.	24
#I'm,# I'm currently living in Dallas	24
{D well } I guess we're supposed to talk about the changing roles of women.	24
[ that's, + that's  ] one of, I think, the hard things right now,	24
Uh-huh.	15
there I go. #	13
factory jobs are so much more, {F um, } {F uh, } sophisticated.	9
{C And } [ I, + I ] don't think it would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if, {D you know, } six or seven voted not guilty, then instead of it being a hung jury, that was an acquittal.	9
{F Uh. }	15
I work for G T E. In Maryland,	24
That's right.	36
three.	24
[ I, + I  ] feel like it's important for young children to read too. And what you read to them.	9
I can hardly wait to get -- -- up there.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Right,	36
{D Well, } it has been real good talking to you.	38
Yeah,	15
{C and } of course, you can't just sit around and wait.	24
<Laughter> Ours is, too.	24
[ [ I, + I, ] + I ] do like, {F uh, } U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT.	24
[ in, + in, ] -	26
I did not want to call attention.	24
<Laughter>.	20
I went to my first Lincoln this last time.	24
{C but } -- -- it's clearly a place where, {F uh, } {F uh, } -	9
Most the time they have a pretty good guarantee,	9
<Laughter>.	20
{C So } there's no incentive for  them to do anything.	9
[ I, + I ] started subbing just to go on a vacation and saved, all that money [ so + ] because I knew that you couldn't, {D you know, } spending, five thousand dollars on a vacation, or whatever.	24
{D Well, } {D you know, } [ that's, + that's ] fine.	21
[ O-, + okay. ]	29
But, then, again, I was also in, uh, the marching band.	24
[ {C so, } + # {C or, } ]  {F uh, } #  obviously. -	24
I had some instructors that, {F uh, } would invite me  over to their house for extended study things on weekends, when I was having trouble with something	24
-- {C so } TRAVEL AND LEISURE, FOOD AND WINE and I think they have some others, {F uh, } certainly half the pages and maybe more are pure ads plus they have the advertising supplement sections that are supposed to look like articles  but  are paid for	24
Because they, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
# Yeah. #	15
# {F Oh, } boy. #	21
Right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
# Uh-huh.  #	15
Yeah.	15
Oh.	15
[ I had this one, + {D well } I've still got ] the book.	24
{C and, } -	26
Yeah.	4
All right.	15
It is fun.	36
Uh-huh.	15
Some sort of program or, -	9
Yeah.	15
by the time it gets there	9
[ if, +  if ] I'm not, {E I mean, } -	24
Thank you.	38
like, uh, engineers usually work fifty or sixty hours a week,	24
Ooh,	29
{C and } maybe it'll  comfort her, {D you know, } when she's fussy and stuff.	9
No,	33
I do,	24
I see.	21
{D well, } [ that, + that ] was number one for the week {D actually, } too,	24
Yeah.	15
# {D See, } # [ [ we, + we're, ] + we ]  have no say so as to where the money goes in the first place.	24
{C And } it was really wild.	24
Oh.	15
Yeah.	15
{F Um, } that sounds pretty. Yeah.	21
Wow.	21
{C and } right now I am paying and  praying.	24
{D well } I guess we should get on with this.	18
# Here, {D you know, } # the real problems are the gangs.	24
certainly not,	36
I guess they just buy it at a restaurant when they eat it at a restaurant maybe.	9
{C and then } they {D actually } won the series bye-bye sort of a sneaky route, {F um, } against Boston -- -- when there was the ball that was sort of hit to Buckner  ((   )) .	9
{C And, }  [ I guess even back to Kennedy, +   as a matter of fact, I guess Kennedy ] may be the one that actually started the thing, or was,  {D you know, } really interested in things like that.	9
{D well, } {D like } my, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } [ I read, + [ I, + I ] also read, ]  I, -	24
I don't know where you're from,	28
{C And, } {F um, } [ the, +  the ] peonies have been out for now about three weeks --	24
{C and } I've seen in more in Durham than I have in Raleigh [ [ or, +  or -- ] + -- or ] Chapel Hill.	24
Do you?	12
{C but } it got too expensive,	24
Huh.	15
Uh-huh,	15
{C and } we keep them apart	25
# [ You don't use, + # you don't use ]  the medical insurance?	8
<Laughter>.	20
No?	14
He's going to sue the pants off of you.	24
[  It's, + it's ] an interesting issue.	9
it's pretty amazing.	9
I'm an engineer.  # {D You know. } #	24
I wasn't sure,	24
I think we agree a lot on that	9
Yeah,	36
I enjoy a lot of movies.	24
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } [ I, + I ] haven't taught in Iowa,	17
{C And, } {F uh, } -	26
I've been a consultant recently -- -- and so I don't have any benefits at all	24
{F uh, } {C and } I found that I really like CHINA BEACH	24
Yeah.	15
You bet you.	36
{C and } they're people just like us.	9
Yes,	15
Yeah.	26
is it in Dallas?	7
No,	15
it was called a sassafras,	24
Okay <laughter>.	13
We, -	26
{C But } there are teams that practice sixty hours a	9
You probably did.	36
Uh-huh.	15
Now our temperatures down here, we're starting to get pretty consistently  in the seventies and eighties --	24
{C and then } they got, -	26
{C and then } [ they + <breathing> they ] start stiffening the penalties.	9
{E I mean, } no matter how careful you are you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot.	24
{D Well, } I like, {F uh, } classical, and, {F uh, } sort of, {F uh, } popular rock type music.   {F Uh, }	24
we have a seven year old,	24
yeah.	15
{D Well, } I had kind of gotten used to centigrade  temperature, {D you know, }	24
Uh-huh.	15
I have a Pontiac Six Thousand.	24
They're very rich in oil and gas.	24
Don't they usually tell you to say something?	7
uh-huh,	36
Uh-huh,	15
I do too.	24
{C and } she still works everyday	24
Oh.	15
you just felt,  gee, if I weren't here, how, -	9
I know.  I was born there.  {F Um. }	13
there you go.	21
{C So, } {F uh, } I was able to, {F uh, } not just exist.	24
they're collected twice a month  and the trash [ and, + and ] this bottled stuff  that is put [ in a, + in a ] little blue bin that's picked up and sorted out into a truck.	24
in Texas they think it's -	24
sure.	24
{C so } <child_talking>. -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } -- -- it gives you a different <laughter> perspective on what people do.	24
I don't know if you feel the same	8
{C and } they no sooner get out on the street  and they're back in again.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C so } it's, {F uh, } such a responsibility.	24
{D Well, } no,	33
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } it is the I B M -- -- {F um, } clone.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but, } the end result is after you put [ your, + your ] panels on, nobody sees that <laughter> you got one screw missing in [ your, + your ] window regulator anyway	24
I was, {F uh, } from California,	24
{C but } I suspect it would work.	9
yeah.	15
I'm not sure where you're from.	28
Yeah <laughter>.	15
college, I guess.	24
Yeah,	15
yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
i-, -	26
-- that's what I figure,	36
[ That, + that ] helps some,	9
That the, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{D well } it's sort of [ the his-, + the historical ] fiction about, {F uh, } the Salisbury area [ in, + in ] England.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and, }  {F uh, } [ there's, + {F uh, } there's ] some petting, {D you know, } like, {F uh, } {F uh, } -	24
It was made to placate some of the northern support  but not completely alienate all the southern support because, {D you know, }  [ it was, +  {F uh, } if you read it, it only emancipated ] those who were in areas,  {F uh, } in rebellion against the United States.	9
{C and } [ I do, + I do ] very little,	24
{F Um, } {C but } what other kind of foods,	1
I guess a hundred is sixty-two.	24
# {E I # mean } I'm sort of [ in a, + in a ] government run medicine program.	24
{C so. } -	26
I found [ about five, + {F uh, } about nine ]  of them that had not even been folded into boxes, that were in the dumpsters.	24
Oh.	15
and it's the first big car I had since I had my nine passenger Impala station wagon from seventy-six to eighty.	24
[ You don't, +  they don't ] graduate the  best engineers or the best English majors, but -- -- maybe a graduate pretty good  overall students out of there.	9
{C but } I don't really know, -	19
Is that right?	12
did you call them and tell them [ you just, +  you just. ] -	7
Right.	15
Oh. I see,	15
Jerry, the topic was favorite T V shows, and  what kind are you interested in, [ and -- -- how they, + and do  they ] differ from {D like } mine.	24
Here, they've just started, started doing that,	24
{F um, } {C or } our breakers [ aren't, + aren't ] powerful enough [ [ to take, + to, ] + to ] really help with the load in the house.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yes.	36
Credit union has nine percent interest.	24
Really.	12
{F Oh, } yeah,	15
{C and then } [ I, + you're ]  supposed to do chicken,	24
Uh-huh.	15
yes.	36
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah,	36
{C and } I. -	26
Yeah.	15
Do you work for T I?	7
That's interesting.	21
{C But, } {F uh, } {D anyway, } -	26
I'll talk to you later.	38
They have it {D like } before one of the [ church things, + {F uh, } {D you know, } church ] that comes on?	24
Right.	15
{C and } we found that if it's in a certain  part of Texas, some people come,	24
Right,	15
{C and } now they have turned it all around and done a pretty remarkable  job	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
Of course that's what I played,	24
he's, -	26
<Laughter>.	20
Treated wood can really make you sick too.	9
{C And } there was another town called Barry   Saint Edmunds about twenty miles away from us.	24
{F Huh. }	15
it was while I had my family and everything and it was a lot harder,	24
{C And } they have no children in school or, {D you know, } anything now.	24
I didn't notice anything simplified about it, except that they took away the deductions, the interest and, other things <laughter>.	24
{D You know. } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C and so } we could no longer afford that monthly payment,	24
{C and } [ they, +  they've ] got twenty, thirty thousand dollar debts,	24
{C and } again -	26
it was like, I think, the summer between my, {F uh, } high school and college.  Somewhere around in there.	13
Yeah.	36
Oh.	15
they report facts,	24
<Sigh> <noise> Yeah,	4
Two or three times a year you'll get a news bull-, -	24
{C And } it's going to go to the highest bidder <laughter>.	24
yeah.	36
{C so } being a  transplanted Texan [ in, + in ] the Dallas area, I have to stick with those Dallas Mavericks.	24
{C but } I was just offended by some of the questions, I guess.	24
T I -er to, -	2
{C so } he really does use it as a vacation home.	8
Uh-huh.	15
# {D Well, } no #	3
{C and } I, burned my grass off here in the last couple of days -- -- getting ready to start to the Spring season, and see if I can grow me another nice lawn,	24
takes about four hours to cook one.	24
He [ drives, + drives ] a Honda.	24
{D Well, } [ great, + great. ]	21
[ {C or } +  {C so. } ] -	26
[ I'm,   <breathing> I'm ] only about, {F uh, } twelve miles or so from the, {F uh, } border of Washington D C, <breathing> and Montgomery County,	24
But on, on the other hand, I don't guess they're polluting.	9
# Uh-huh. #	15
{D Well, } {D anyway, } -	26
[ they're, +  they're ] given three baskets --	24
Right.	36
-- {C or } do I look for a used car that's maybe [ two, + three ] years old [ that  -- + -- but that's, ] {D you know, } low mileage and in good shape.	16
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
{C So } that was interesting.	24
I think [ there are, + {E I mean } there's ] an  institutional memory that you need to maintain.	9
<Breathing> That's true <breathing>.	36
Right,	36
<laughter> {F Oh, } that's neat,  that she's in good health, and [ that, + ] at that age.	21
{D Well } I'm such a terrible swimmer	24
Yeah,	36
{C but } our parking lot's in one end [ of the, + of the ] campus	24
I love it.	24
{F Oh, } really,	15
{D so. } -	26
How about, {F um, } Pink Floyd?	7
Uh-huh,	15
{D you know, } I was, -	26
It's hard to always keep yourself feeling like you're doing something productive,	9
{C and } I guess you could say it's similar as far as -- -- # [ the kind # of ma-, + the way they do it. ]	9
{C and } [ the, + ] # [ that, + that ] bothers me. #	24
{C And, } {F uh, } from there just, {F well, } -	24
{F Uh, } yes,	4
I'm on a exercise program.	24
{C and, } I don't know, [ I just don't want, + I just don't want ] strangers raising my children.	24
I think it will become resume writing.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
{C or, } I am sorry,	41
Okay,	15
And, and, uh, {pause} -	26
They are very nice.	24
{C And } [ [ y-, + the, ] + the wind, + ] {D you know, } it had a mike on it,	24
I heard [ Mister  Bush say, +  {E excuse me, } President Bush say ]  that he, {F uh, } wanted to improve the highways.	24
{F Oh, } that's terrible.	21
# An [ even, + even ] if it's just a little bit. #	9
University of Texas, Dallas.	24
[ I haven't, + I haven't ] heard that.	24
I know that when James was with Continental Steel, McCullum was part of that,	24
Yeah.	15
you just say, {D well } look read the miles per hour one,	24
I brought him in so. <breathing> <laughter> -	24
they have a big truck that has {D like } [ [ te-, + not ten, ] + maybe five ] big doors on the side of it,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C so. } -	26
{D well, } go ahead,	18
{D Well, } [ I, +  I ]  guess I just have not read anyth-, -	24
{C So } [ it's, + it's ] -- -	26
{C and, } -	26
{F uh, } something from [ each, + each ] area that you're supposed to choose from.	24
those are things I like the most.	24
{D Now } I told  ((   )) , -	26
yes.	36
Uh-huh,	36
I was like, God, how much were those bottles <laughter> {D you know? }	24
-- I would love to be able to go see those.	24
{C but } [ they weren't, + they were ] only picking up once a week.	24
<Laughter> That's sweet,	21
[ They had been, + I can't remember if they had been shot ] or if they had just been thrown in the freezer	24
Uh-huh.	15
Really?	12
{C and } that's no cartoons for my little boy.	24
{C so } you can get in and  out ... -	24
uh-huh.	26
<Rustling>.	20
{C and } the youngest is probably twenty-seven, twenty-eight.	24
somebody wants to do that, -	9
{C so } [ I, + I ] wish I could tell you	17
{D You know, } kind of off the wall.	24
# <Laughter> # # Yeah. #	15
Yeah,	15
something's wrong.	9
{F Uh, } I  think that's really a decision [ th-, +  # that, ] # -	9
{C and } it was when all that bad weather [ was, + was ] hitting,	24
{E I mean, } I was in Phoenix [ in January, + last January ]	24
{C and } she didn't understand.	24
Bill, we're talking  about family reunions.	24
{C But, } [ I exercise, +  I don't exercise ] now,	24
{C And } I can't say that I like a lot of [ the modern, + the [ very, + very ] -- -- modern, ] {F uh, } rock and roll,	24
{C and } all the others were standing there barking and jumping up and down.	24
Yeah.	4
Yeah,	36
[ it +  {C and } [ from, +  from ]  what I can tell if they had gotten into it, it ]  would have started a whole new war.	9
Well, I agree with the boredom of the election process,	36
Oh.	15
{C But } [ I don't remem-, + I don't remember ]  if it was Raleigh and Saint Augustine  [ or, + or ] what.	24
{F Oh, } yeah,	15
<lipsmack> the first  two years I was in a room where they didn't heat it <laughter>. #	24
right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
# No. #	36
[ we do keep, +  {F uh, } {D well }  we started out keeping ] a budget about two years, ago,	24
Because, -	26
I'm from Dallas, Texas.	24
[ the, + the  ] prep school they go to before they can play -- -- because they aren't smart enough.  -	24
{C so, } it was still a lot cheaper than what we gave because ours is thirty years,	9
Yeah,	36
# {C and then } she makes noodles [ with, + # {F uh, }  with, ] # [ s-, + # soy ] sauce or whatever,	24
[ if, + if ] she enjoys movies I think it'll work pretty good.	9
Yeah,	15
Right.	36
It's pretty power isn't it <laughter>?	7
{F Uh, } we are in the process  of trying to buy a house,	24
{F Uh, }  as far as {D like } real novels, I haven't gotten into Shakespeare or any of that type of thing.	24
{C And then } they have other wings that we visited, {F uh, } that are very nice.	24
{C but, } [[[ I, + I, ] + i-, ] + it ] just is not one of the things that I have, {F uh, } placed, {F uh, } {F uh, } [ a, + a ] lot of my particular time and effort -- -- into,	24
{F Um, } [ do you go to, + do you go to ]  listen to much live music?	7
The recipes are really  interesting, {D you know. }	9
{C And } I can't stand to be outside at all when it's like that,	24
{C And } did you ever eat at the Blue Bin Diner?	7
{C and } you can stack them up [ and, + and ] leave them out and put things in them, even.	24
Oh yes,	36
Yeah,	4
Bye-bye.	38
<Breathing>.	20
How's the -- -- weather out there in Georgia?	39
that's one thing that I have learned [ in w-, + working in ] elections and things is, {D you know, } sometimes even when you work for someone you don't really know what they're like.	9
Boy,	21
was, two years ago, # we # went during the drought.	24
{C so. }  Let's  see what else can we do?	31
yeah.	36
Uh-huh.	29
I remember there was about [ four, + five ] years ago.	24
Yeah.	15
# {C and } # they say that they can tie up your answering machine and just have a big long, if they catch your answering machine,	24
I think the biggest change that we've seen, {F um, } [ in, + in  ] my life or whatever lately is the economy,	9
Uh-huh.	15
I wouldn't mind it.	38
We just went through that ourselves.	24
{C or } [ you go <laughter> + {D you know } -- -- you fend  ] for yourself.	9
and I think that's sad.	9
everybody -- -- seems to like it.	24
Yeah,	36
I've lived [ in, + in  ] the Dallas area here since I was like four.	24
{D Actually } I even understood it better <laughter>.	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
{F Uh, } it started out several years ago when they put these, {F uh, } collection sites -- -- [ they, + ] {F uh, } near a WalMart, near a football stadium and the like,	24
I don't know that it's ever been seriously considered, {F uh, } as far as close to passing, {F uh, } any legislation or anything like that.	24
I'm glad you are,	24
Okay,	29
{C So, } -	26
{C But } I think that for this kid, it's going to be, {D you know, } his lifesaver.	9
{C And } -- -- is sold as Purple Buddy  or sometimes sold as straw flower.	24
{C And } one of the ones that had an impact was, {F uh, } people becoming interested in alternate practices,	9
<Laughter> They're okay,	24
I guess, [ I don't, + I don't  ] like hard rock.	24
{C and } he ended up keeping him.	24
Uh-huh.	13
{C But, } {F uh, } {D you know, } we have, {F uh, } {D well, } -	26
{C but } when, {F uh, } -	26
it is, -	26
{D Well, } it's been great talking to you.	38
Right.	38
You would never think of having to replace the clutch in a Mercedes, especially not after two years.	9
Are you?	12
No.	36
{D Well, } [ [ I, + I, ] + {F uh, } I ] have to, {F uh, } agree with that, even when they was   very,  very  popular in the early sixties,	24
Huh-uh.	15
# Uh-huh. #	15
yeah,	15
they may not want it as a whole	9
Okay,	15
That's true.	36
{C And } they're not going to excuse people, if it [ was, + was ] run like that,	9
[ {C and } -- + -- {C and } ] we got to where, {D well, } we were just friends	24
Uh-huh.	15
But, {F um, } something that still has a lots of amenities and, {D you know, } gadgets and things.	24
{C and } [ [ if you get in the, + if, ] + if you can find one in the ] right area you can really -- -- # pick up a steal. #	9
{C And, so } we'll go to a lake   [ and, + ] {F uh, } <throat_clearing>  where they can go do that.	24
owe the children education and all that, {F uh, }	24
You pay all your bills	24
Sure.	15
{C and, } {F uh, } {D well, } as you said, mostly they are token cuts.	9
It just sort of keeps that going.	24
{D Well, } most frostings are sort of butter cream to aren't they.  *[[ to = too ]]	7
[ she was, + she  ] went to school to be a teacher just because she did not really know what else to go, for,	24
{F Uh } <inhaling> <throat_clearing> I also, {F uh, } -	26
I work with Elma.	24
[ they, + they ] charged you [ by, + by ] weight of how much trash you were actually sending to a land fill.	9
Okay,	13
Yeah.	15
{C and } it was overnight,	24
{F ((Uh, } guy)),	13
{C but } since the price of paper has gone down -	24
{C So } she's going to sell it rather than trade it in.	24
Uh-huh.	15
uh-huh.	4
{F Uh, } {D well, } [ I, +  I ] do, {F uh, } real rough  type camping.	24
{C But } I do think that we have to cut out some of this folderol stuff and go back in the first five, six grades and just keep going over and over and over until most of those that are capable can at least learn to read and write --	9
right.	36
Yeah,	36
Yeah,	15
They're really good?	8
Right now we've recycled glass for [ ye-, be-, + years because  ] we have a glass industry in our community.	24
{C and }  [ we started taking her, +  she was pretty young when we started, {F uh, } camping with her. ]	24
Sure.	15
[ [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] + {D you know, } {C and, } ] [ it, +  it's ] almost like, -	9
{C and } w-, -	26
{C and } I don't.	24
{C And } they're all quite young --	24
[ it was, + he was ] supposed to be there at six o'clock, not seven o'clock,	24
# Bye-bye. #	38
How long did that movie run?	39
Yeah.	36
I have, {F uh, } -	26
freedom of choice -- -	26
Uh-huh <laughter>.	15
Yeah.	15
{C and, } {F uh, } I'm happy with it.	24
I imagine.	21
{C so. } What do you do?	26
Uh-huh.	15
{D like } my American Express  I use for, {D you know, } gas, things like that,	24
Yeah,	36
we really, -	26
Believe me.	18
<Laughter> That's true,	21
{C and } they started having real bad side effects.	24
I always balanced  [ in the, +  in the ] situation.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } it was a demo, returned --	24
{C Or, } {E I'm sorry }  no,	32
everyone does newspapers.	9
Uh-huh.	36
{F Oh, } don't made any excuses for him <laughter>.	18
(( what els-, )) .	17
that is for sure.	24
[ {C And, } + {F um, } {C but } ] [ it's, + it's ] a very beautiful part, very interesting historically, of course, which was my interest  ((   ))  art history.	24
That's hilarious.	21
{F Oh, } {D well, } yes,	36
{C so } -- -- that was kind of interesting <laughter>.	24
<Clicking> {D Well } I haven't had an awful lot of, {F uh, } incidents regarding child care.	24
{D Well, } at T I we have to use what's called a (( tex teller ))  -- -- if we want to get cash out	24
it might be classical,	24
{C and, } {F Oh, } it's pretty good as far as Chinese,	9
-- {C and } we have got another boy that is, [ us, + ] out in Maryland.	24
[ {C and } -- + -- {C and } ] the last one got hit, {F uh, } as she was following [ my, +  one of my sons ] across the road to the school.	24
Uh-huh.	15
I'm not really expecting to get anything out of it, # except # to be momentarily pleased, {D you know, } because [ I don't, + I can never ] remember, # the # plots or anything, # later # on those books.	24
Although they've got, {F uh, } Meals On Wheels, # Which # I understand is a really good,  {D you know, } way to handle that so  that at least they eat.	24
She started late.	24
If it could just be spread out a little bit.	9
{F Oh, } you bet it's ju-, -	21
Oh.	15
Right,	36
Oh. Uh-huh.	13
[ I, +  I ] get all my money out of the teller.	24
Uh-huh.	15
it's very difficult to get along on one income unless <breathing>,  {F uh, } the male, {F uh, } has an extraordinarily good job.	9
[ [ I, +  I  grew up, ] +  {F uh, } I was born ] in, {F uh, } Muncie, Indiana, [ and, + and  ] grew up a little bit in Terre Haute,	24
they come in there,	24
Oh <laughter>.	29
{D Well, } I enjoyed talking to you.	38
[ I do, + I do ] like to go to movies,	24
I think we could take care of everything.   And quit taking care of all these other countries all across the world, # {D you # know, } who just end up using  things against us later on anyway.	9
yeah	15
[ ever-, + everybody ] might learn something that way,	9
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] I don't know.	19
{D Well, } [ I, + {F um, } I ] do an awful lot of preparation of documents, {F um, } {F uh, }	24
<Laughter>.	20
house payment <laughter>.	9
{C So, } [ I'm, + {F uh, } I ] just   love to sew	24
{C and } that, of course, has got to be critical.	24
{C and so }  I didn't have to, -	24
I'm sorry,	13
[ the ex-, + the, {F uh, } weight lifting ]  on the other hand is actually, {E you know, } -	24
<laughter> okay.	26
# Sure.  #	15
You look at Frito Lay.	18
they might give you a little blurbs like -- -- this happened or that happened	9
they really do.	24
[ {C But, } + {C and } ] it's been pretty successful	9
they did ask that they build  up Israel and Kuwait.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C But, }   [ that's been, +  it's been ]   fun,	24
{C But, } to continue in that vein, I think it got a little bit warped and off the track -- -- in several areas,	24
Like you said,  you can sit and do it, and  watch the T V and not even really be conscious of  what you are doing.	36
[ [ I +  <laughter> I   don't, ] + I don't  ] think George Bush will make the American people happy with <laughter> ninety-seven cents a week.	9
I don't understand why we don't enforce the laws we have.	24
Uh-huh,	15
{F Um, } yeah,	4
# {D Well, } [ I, + I've  ] # seen more, {F uh, } incredibly intelligent underachievers #  [ than, # -- + -- than,  ] {F uh, } -	24
I asked questions such as how they would discipline a child.	24
yeah,	15
I don't think we've gone [ our, + our ] ten minutes	38
Uh-huh,	15
{C And, } {F uh, } tends to cause our kids  to really have to buckle down to keep up with them, which is not bad.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Okay,	38
Right.	15
{C but } + {F uh, } # -	26
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah,	15
{C and } I can't really, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } then the cat, {F uh, } died.	24
{C But, } {F uh, } [ it's, + [ so + ] it's ]  very, very mixed	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } this has been interesting.	9
Then we take our major purchases we want to make during that year	24
{F Um. }  Trying to think.	17
{C and } I don't even think I  know my number <laughter>.	24
{D You know, } the instructor told us certain things about {D well, } don't follow what's really necessarily on the box, {D you know, } if you're making just a cake from a box, {D you know, } do this cause, {D you know, } make it a variety.	24
{E I mean, } everything is more solid in it.	24
<Laughter> Yeah.	36
that's right.	36
Yes.	15
{F Oh, } # that's interesting. #	21
Yeah,	36
[ He, + his ] back is bad all the time now, I think.	11
{C And so } why do you like stick shift?	39
Yeah,	4
No,	33
Uh-huh.	15
that's exactly right.	21
I know.	36
March we typically get a lot of rain,	24
there's a lot of air pollution.	9
Right,	36
# Congratulations. #	21
{F um, } I don't see a problem with that.	9
{C and } -- -- [ [ now, + now  it's, ] + now it's ] a fast machine <laughter>.	24
Right.	36
I've caught it a few times	24
{D You know, } young women, with small children -- -- are the ones that I find.	24
{C and } I sold {F uh, } {D you know, } manure.	24
{C so } hi-, -	26
-- {C but } it's kind of fun.	24
{F Uh, } I do, {F uh, } follow, {F uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, } -	24
Uh-huh.	36
{C and } by definition, <laughter> for some of us, at least, the public good includes having an educated populace  and #  (( then ))  # -- -- idea that, {F uh, } you can make a sound judgment  with respect to small votes [ in the, + at the ] local level or bigger votes at -- -- the national level.	9
It's not like driving [ a, +  a ]  Winnebago or something.	9
{E I mean, } I don't like Dodges at all	24
Right.	15
{D Well, } [ I had the, + I had a ] broiled chicken breast	24
{C but, } hey,	21
{C But, } -	26
(( Amen )) .	21
Uh-huh.	15
# Yeah. #	15
I think Tennessee has been the furthest east I've been.	24
depending upon the field,  I know there are some fields which a person should go to [ the school, + that school,  ] all four years,	24
forget what else we did	17
Right.	15
Yeah,	13
{C and, }  {D well, } my little girl goes to tap dance,	24
the Legend, it's just so huge.	24
Uh-huh.	7
It's amazing.	24
{C and } from my mother's generation to my generation [ it's + [ just a very, very wide, + ] {F uh, } it's ] been a big change.	9
that's true.	36
{F Uh, } I think another thing, -	9
{C and } it's something I can do still.	24
If the doctor makes a mistake,  he can be sure that he's going to be hauled into court.	9
yeah	36
I don't even guess they've even thought about sending the schedules out yet.	9
# With a # three fifty in it.	24
{C And } we had kind of a hard time finding someplace  ((   ))  we could put Michael's  (( goods )) ,	24
[ You don't, + you don't ] really appreciate it until you're much older anyway.	9
{C and } I think that, -	9
[  I, + I ] think of, {F uh, } {D you know, } all the, social changes that were going on around that time. [  And, + # and ] # the sixties as being so revolutionary in a lot of ways in terms of raising people's consciousness.  Everything from, -	24
Did you see it?	7
They want him because he's popular, not because he can do the job.	9
{C And } it isn't because of the, {D well, } -	24
{C so } [ when, + {F uh, }  long, long time ago, when ]  I used to live in apartments, I would pay a rent payment every month and a tax payment every month.	24
{C or } is it Tim Hardaway.	1
you mentioned painting your bathroom.	24
<Laughter>.	20
as soon as [ you, + you ] get rid of one goon [ [ that's, + that's, ] + that's ] involved in # drugs and tha-, # -	9
-- that kind I kind of like.	24
{C But } they're so good about clearing the roads, that, {D you know, } it doesn't usually bother you very much.	24
{F Hm. }	15
lots of their picture and life story and everything.	24
Are you a T I -er,	7
I die every time companies like General Dynamics, -	24
# Yeah. #	15
Right.	15
I think the elementary school teachers, or  maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier [ than, + than ] some of the high school teachers, I think.	9
Yeah. <sigh> #	36
Remember that? <Sniffing> <dishes>.	7
Yeah.	15
{C And, }  {F uh, } he opened the door.	24
{C but, } -	26
Yeah,	15
they sort of took over the, {F um, } -	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } they stole our tailgate off his truck <laughter>.	24
Okay,	29
{C And } it also builds too much mass if you just, {D you know. } -	9
<static> I certainly do.	11
{C And } you are always so anxious to see  where it goes.	9
{D Well, } there is so many chances for appeal, that it kee-, -	9
{C but } [ I'm, + I'm ] not sure where it begins.	24
[ [ [ Are, + are, ] + are you, ] + are you ] also a professor,	7
{C And } I'd just be, -	24
I have trouble with the chemical plants and things like that [ I just, + {F uh, } I ] think they put off so much	24
Uh-huh.	15
# [ {C So, } + # {C but, } ] [ [ we, + we've  tried, ] + we've tried ] everything	24
Sure,	15
{E I mean, } {D you know, } it's got little rooms that separate off of it and stuff,	24
<Talking> <<someone in background>>.   *[[what is this]]	20
{D Well, } it was pretty reasonable.	9
{F Oh, } Hank Williams Junior?	7
Right,	36
I just remember Sting was in it.	24
[ [ I, + I, ] + I ] know other places when they recycle, they have to, {D like, } wash out their glass jars and -- -- whatnot. [ And, + ] {F uh, } which we're not in the habit of doing.	24
they don't know what to do,	9
There's nothing wrong with that.	9
{D See } I'm unfamiliar with that because [ I don't, + I never  see ] that end of the business.	24
[ He, + he ]  loves my son,	24
{C and } they, {F uh, } -	26
{C But } {D anyway, } that's, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
# How # about you?	31
Yes.	15
They, {F uh, } really get, {F uh, } into it.	24
That's right.	36
# {D You know. } #  It's all over the news,	24
I get it from all over.	24
-- {C but, } {F um, } the churches here are growing, leaps and bounds,	9
{D well, } of course  in the, {F uh, } -	26
# {F Um. }  #	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and then } I get {D like } green beans and  mashed potatoes.	24
{C and, } An upper class suburb of Dallas, let me tell you, It's very different.	24
Huh-uh.	15
<Breathing> <laughter> I had a carpet service call up three times, all within in an hour,	24
{F Oh, } does it?	12
{C and, } {F uh, } he'd always tell us, {D you know, }  okay, look for, {D you know, } a nice flat little area where we can pitch our tents,	24
I just don't, {D you know, } -	26
# When I call, # -	26
Uh-huh.	15
Okay.	29
yeah,	26
Yeah.	4
Uh-huh,	15
so I can afford it,	24
{C but } our two children are just, {F uh, } as, {F um, } unlike as night and day.	24
We'd enjoy it so much	24
Are they to you?	7
<thumping>.	20
Exactly,	36
{F Uh, } one evening I decided to retire early and heard sirens and noises and  thought, {F oh, } {D well, } something's happens on Mockingbird and then heard yells and  screams	24
You ought to take all them little misdemeanor people --	9
{F Oh } is that five minutes,	8
{C and } I'm calling from Garland, Texas.	6
{C And } I guess we had most of it done	24
{C And } they're in the same classrooms.	9
I was going to tell you the same thing.	24
my mother and I were, {F uh, } really, [ prac-, + ] first generation  divorce in our family.	24
it's, -	26
I say {D well, } I need a checkup in six months,	24
Right.	15
I-, -	26
+ [ I don't think y-, + I don't think it's ] right to just put someone in it.	9
# {C and } # there's all sorts of things down there.	24
Right.	15
I think we are the third owners.	24
-- {C but } if you're in the corporate world, I think there is considerable motivation for <noise> I guess [ in-, + innovation, ]	9
T I had a place,	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
{C and } [ I, + I  ] still really don't do that much, as you say, play games on it <laughter>,	24
{C and then } the Iranian couldn't, -	26
Yeah,	15
# {C and } # I think it has worked very well.	24
Yeah,	15
You're probably a  veteran <laughter> -- -- at this.	38
Yeah,	36
{C and } they're not quite big enough to be getting into everything yet,	9
# {C but } # I think his attachments at home -	24
Say what?	14
It seems like a lot of my neighbors kind of have a  similar type, I don't know, life.	24
Yeah,	15
I don't know what they call it now,	24
{C so } I've been thinking, especially now is a good time to buy a car.	24
{D like } the customer is always right	24
we have got a lot of that influence.	9
Yeah,	36
That's good.	21
{C but } I just can't seem to find the time.	24
Yeah,	15
It's situational, really.	9
{F Oh, } how great.	21
I have, {F uh, } a son who's a sophomore in college up in Massachusetts -- -- at, {F uh, }  Amherst,	24
{E I mean, } -	26
{F Oh, } definitely.	36
Yeah,	38
Oh.	29
{F Oh, } that's nice.	21
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah?	12
{C or } a person personally. -	9
I don't know, [ the peop-, +   [ [ [ [ the, +  the, ] +  the, ] +  {A that's just children, } [ but + ] the, ] +  the ] people ] that  I went to high school with, {F um, } I think the majority are in [ [ that, +  the, ] +  probably the ]  generation, yours and mine	9
[ this, + this, ] {F uh, } deficit state that -  *[[ Bad parsing?  Seems to be part of previous utterance. ]]	24
Still be on.	2
{F Oh, } I know.	36
-- {C and then } it doesn't sell	24
{C And } it works real good.	24
It's one of the small bottles.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
{F Uh, } [ our, + our ] last house wasn't too bad,	24
Uh-huh.	36
[ It, + it's ] what's important to you.	9
I'm about sick of mine right now.	24
{C And } I'm doing my best -- -- to keep that up.	24
Yeah,	15
{D Well, } yeah,	36
That's pretty impressive.	9
{C But } I've made a, {F um, } few things, cross-stitch things.	24
Yeah.	15
{C but } I just haven't got around to doing it yet.	24
#Yeah.#	15
right.	36
I'm that way about a lot of different shows.	24
Yeah,	36
I mean I don't know.  <laughter>	24
{C And } I went, {D Well, } now you tell me.	24
I can't do that painting thing.	24
Yeah,	15
Bye-bye.	38
Right.	15
{F Oh, } my.	21
I'm sitting here in my forty year old house,	24
{D you know, } on the premeditated murders I feel [ if you're, + {D you know, } {E I mean, } if ] it's beyond a doubt that you did it, {D you know } -- -- I would say go ahead and execute that person as well.	9
it's funny some of their necks don't get broken.	9
Oh.	29
It was only five hundred, dollars at a clip from this organization.	24
Uh-huh.	15
# Yeah,	15
{F um, } most of the stuff is on, {F uh, } literary criticism and philosophy, # and # religion and all that.	24
right,	36
Uh-huh.	15
# {D Well, } # that's I meant when I said the school.	24
{C And } [ I, + I ] just think that, {F uh, } that's [ one of, + one of ] the arts that I think are really pretty.	24
Yeah.	15
I don't know,	19
Okay <laughter>.	29
{E I mean, }	26
{C or } is it more of a company?	35
{F Um, } I have [ some, + some  ] rock and some jazz and a couple, maybe one or two country and western.  Some, {F uh, } {F oh, }  {A I can't believe I can't think of his name. } {F Um, } Garth Brooks,	24
It was cute,	24
I think, {F uh, } they're very helpful,  plus the fact that it's helpful not to  have to carry a lot of money sometimes.	9
{C And } what do you have?	39
{C But } he has a fetish for Oreo cookies.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
{C So } I think there's a bunch of good movies coming out.	24
<Laughter>  {D You know, } [ your, + your ]  fourteen ounce steak with your potato and  stuff.	22
Uh-huh.	15
{C But } if you was talking about something which was more or less universal that, {F uh, } busses and any kind of vehicle, had to pay a pollution tax, {F uh, } this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters,	24
Louisiana.	24
no <laughter>.	33
I think that's an ideal situation.	9
if you  sentence  someone to life, life is only forty-nine  years, something like that.	24
Right.	15
Yeah	36
Uh-huh.	15
Democracy.	2
{F Oh, } I see.	29
{D See, } I can't even think of who the New Orleans quarterback, # is. #	24
{D Well, } there was a movie out, -	24
{C and } we used to get five channels without cable.	24
Uh-huh.	15
with the economy going the way it is and everything, that was nearly ridiculous -- -- thing to, even try to do.	9
uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } let's hope not.	18
It's been about three weeks since we've had any.	24
I'm so  depressed with the Dallas Mavericks, {D you know. }	24
stick shift,	30
# {D Well, } # [ [ [ it, + it, ] + it'll, ] + it'll ] catch on pretty soon, [ I'll, + I'll ] bet you.	9
I guess it was because, -	9
I know on a <breathing>, -	24
Uh-huh,	15
{C and } I know the company that she was with, {F uh, }	24
I was just talking to  someone the other day from Pennsylvania.	24
That's right.	36
<laughter> {C but } I really have been spoiled by sweat pants and these new, {F uh, } units outfits, {D you know, } that are just knit,	24
The main thing that [ they've, + they had ] when my daughter was playing with Barbies was just clothes.	24
I guess they were doing  ((   ))  Eastern Standard Time.	24
{C and } if you pay taxes on it, you wouldn't have any money left over.	9
[ I, + {F uh, } I've ] had no problems with my Subaru,	24
Uh-huh.	15
I grew up in South Dakota,	24
# Yeah. #	15
{F Uh, } I was just now told that's what the topic was	24
It has been there for a hundred years.	24
I like that,	24
# Does he, {F ooh. } #	12
{C but, } -	26
Yeah.	15
Okay.	15
I work for a public school [ system, + district ] --	24
{C But, }  I'm not real sure that we promised them anything.	24
{C and } I'd never miss it for a minute.    *[[slash error]] Especially the beauty pageants.   *[[slash problem]]	13
now that we're getting older, [ people are get-, + {D you know, } each one of us are going ] our own direction.	24
<laughter>.  A satellite dish?	7
My [ in-, + families ] was up in Maryland --	24
{C and } that's one thing that started in the community.	24
I, {F uh, } -	26
Wow.	21
uh-huh.	15
That's super.	21
I like to catch the gymnastics sometimes, too.	24
that's really good.	21
Huh.	26
[ I, + I've ] said several times to my husband that I feel like gee, in ten years they'll have just full nudity on T V	9
# [ You pick up + # -- -- I pick up ] my little one from  preschool	24
I like reading late at night right before I go to bed sometimes	24
{F Um, }    *[[slash error]] And bull dogs <laughter>.	15
it doesn't have  [ any, + ] really the performance that the expensive one does.	24
I cannot think of the word I am looking for.	24
yeah.	15
{F Oh, } no <laughter>. {C But } you still have to pay for it, [ though, + even though  ] they're not going to do it?	21
[ there's, + there's ] a lot of different organizations [ who, + {F uh, } who ] do give grants,	24
It's helped me to think more about some issues that I need to be thinking more about <laughter>.	38
{F Um, } I couldn't believe that you could have open containers of beer, alcohol, whatever, in the car!	24
Wow.	21
Maybe if they were brought up that a way, like you said, it would.	36
{C and } that they've shown, that [ it, + {F uh, } to begin with, apparently it ] does cost more,	24
{F Um, } they've got them set outside <lipsmack>	24
{C So } administrative assistant that would handle two million dollars worth of business is a lot more valuable than a person that handles a hundred thousand dollars worth of business.	9
{C And, } {F uh, } where are you from?	39
It, -	26
What can we do to rectify this situation,	16
{C But then, } {D you know, } it's kind of like [ a, + a ] lottery.	9
whatever [ the + ] fish is the specialist in that area, [ I, + {F uh, } I  ] enjoy fishing for it,	24
Do you?	12
{C So, } [ they've, + they've ] tried to do a lot of that --	24
-- {C and, }  {F um, } it makes a difference,	9
Uh-huh.	15
Bye, bye. #	38
<<Resumes talking to caller>> I just [ wiped, + {F uh, } did ]  the floor,	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } that's fairly recent.	24
{C And } it's probably not a great investment,	9
{C And, } {F uh, } -	26
he's actually not really a puppy anymore	24
# Especially now. #	9
{C and } I have a girl,	24
{F Oh, } the novels, yeah.	24
{F Oh, } boy.	21
okay,	26
Uh-huh.	15
I was saying because I've, -	24
[ It's, +  it's ] staggering when you  think that, just here in central New York, is, {F uh, }	9
Yes.	36
[ I gue-, + {D well, } I guess ] we do go out without kids.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } otherwise it's just one of the regular, {F uh, } channels eight or five.	24
{C because } that is the way of getting attention.	9
Uh-huh.	15
at the end of the semester you've got finals and lots of bills I would suspect.	8
{D You know, } pick it up.	24
I do a hundred then	24
I don't really bother with the Washington station because [ I just, + ] it's so  far removed from what I'm interested in.	24
I don't care what anybody tells you.	24
{C or, } {D you know, } I don't know,	19
# Yeah,	15
The [ m-, + barometric ] pressure drops during a tornado,	24
Uh-huh,	15
{D So, } {F uh, } -	26
Wow.	21
it sure was.	36
<Lipsmack>.	20
yeah. #	15
{F Uh, } cars are too expensive right now [ to, + {F uh } -- -- to  ] even think about buying new cars every couple of years, {D you know }	9
no	36
Yeah,	15
it's, {F uh, } one of the Caribbean Islands	24
I know the whole situation is bad up here,	24
one place, -	24
I need something,	24
Pardon me?	14
{F Uh, } I've got [ a, +  {F uh, } a ] Bombay, a Turkish Van and a Himalayan Persian.	24
Yeah.	15
one paycheck went into savings	24
{F Uh, } hopefully they'll give a subject I like one of these times <laughter>. Something I really know a lot about.	38
{C and } [ they've, + they've ] all been in Dallas.	24
{D So } I loved it.	24
# Oh.  #	15
{C or } -	26
{C and } ends up the best is to take a high deductible [ and, + and ] take a loss, [ what-, + whatever ] ((it)) happens to be,  if you happen to be a healthy individual <laughter>.	24
{C and } we just bought a brisket and  marinated it overnight in one of those {D like } Adolph's meat marinate, and put it on the smoker and cooked it.	24
{C But, }  {D boy, } the period of time was fascinating.	9
{C and, } {F uh, } I was just absolutely shocked, {F uh, } the first time that I saw  his schoolwork.	24
{C Because } when I grew up here, it was just always the crisp air up in the mountain valleys	24
# {C but } [ they also # did, + they also did ] some of the teaching things	24
There's a little more craziness down there <laughter>.	9
{F Um, } {F um, } no,	33
they are mostly all men.	9
Yeah,	26
{F Uh, }	15
You too.	38
Yeah,	15
{C And } I forget what <laughter> the other # books were # ,	24
it's down at Mount Vernon.	24
[ I want, + I want ] something that's [ serviceable, + serviceable, ] something that I can use --	24
I just have a maybe a targeted amount that I will save for.	24
Sure.	15
I think so <laughter>.	9
{C But, }  {F uh, }   (( wha-, )) -	26
{C and } life goes on.	24
{F Oh, } I know.	36
{C So } it's just, {D you know, } -	26
{C and } the sister is in a nursing home,	24
He says, {D now } I'm not going to say you're going to feel like playing ball	24
# Uh-huh # <<faint>>.	15
Cocoa didn't think too much of it, though.	24
I'm for it [ in -- + -- # in ] some cases. #	24
Yeah,	36
Yes.	15
# [ It's + # it's ] an N B C affiliate down here.	24
{F Oh } <laughter>.  Ours are pretty calm.	24
the first appeal is automatic,	9
{C And } they were saying that C N N  is definitely a world, {F uh, } news service	24
# That, # -	26
{C and } people don't do anything.	9
{C So } wha-,  (( in this )) , -	26
<Throat_clearing>.	20
{F Oh, } my gosh,	21
{F Oh, } that's great.	21
I know we have a piece property there,	24
{C Because } you should be given another chance or at least be able to justify it or something.	9
# <Laughter> #  <children> <noise>.	20
What advice -- -- would you give?	39
{C and } I will find that thing.	24
<Laughter>.	20
They might as well have not even been there.	9
{C and, so, } -	26
{C and } yet the funding has already, {F uh, } exceeded,	24
Yeah,	36
# {C And } we're, # -	26
Did you see PRETTY WOMAN?	7
{C and } now, {D you know, } -	26
in the Dallas area	24
# [ {C So, } + {F uh } # -- -- {C so } ] [ that + ] there are a lot of problems  along that line also.	9
San Diego?	8
[ It, + it's  ] going to disorient and confuse a lot of people for years and years	9
{F Uh, } [ a-, + ]  [ and in + ] Tulsa	24
{D well, } I, {F um, } -	26
<Breathing> Jeri?	13
{C And so } I'm usually, {F uh, } pretty careful when I shop --	24
{C and } [ it's + <breathing>, it ] is so much fun to -- -- see these players you see on T V [ to, + ] {C and } to hear that ball go whizzing by.	24
{D well, } I think we've covered most of my favorite T V shows.	24
-- {C and, } {F uh, } you can really, {F uh, }  feel comfortable in, {F uh, } evaluating that, {F uh, } candidate by, {F uh, } that method.	9
[ Do you, + {F uh, }  did you ] take classes to learn how to do that?	7
uh-huh.	15
It's # unfortunate. #	9
{D So } you have never heard of {D like } the Christian music that I listen to probably.	8
[ We're  in the sub-, +  I'm in the suburb ] of Cleveland	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
{F Um, } I've got one question for you.	24
{F Oh, } that's good,	36
{C And, } {F uh, } {F oh, } {E excuse me, } my baby's getting sick.	24
yeah,	15
{C so, } -	26
{D Well, } -	26
[ we, + we ] try to take it, {D you know, } -	24
{C Because } I, -	26
Yeah.	4
it probably does.	36
{E I mean, } it's just beautiful.	24
{C but } we had a small yard  and a pool	24
Yeah,	15
it's unair-conditioned,	24
Oh.	15
I guess, {F uh, }  [ I, +  it's ] more not so much a hobby but things I enjoy doing.	24
{D Well, } I come from a very small family.	24
{C So } we're riding bicycles	24
{C but } I -- -	26
{F uh, } {D well } have you pay a lot of in ta-, -	26
mostly oldies.	24
[ In a + -- -- in a ] maximum security prison down in central Virginia.	24
What do you have there?	39
[ [ we, + we  ] send, + we send  ] some of it out because [ it, + our body  ] doesn't accept some of it.	9
{C and } they had to sit in there by themselves.	24
Yeah,	15
{C and so } there are a couple jazz houses, {D you know, } that have jazz bands playing while you're eating and stuff like that, # which is kind of nice, # because, -	24
-- {C so, } [ you, + you ] reached me at my job.	24
{C But, } {E I mean } the whole idea behind it is far fetched.	9
What have your other topics been?	39
but no, uh, no snow.	33
{F Oh, } I don't know.	19
{C and } [ you get to sands-, +  {D well, } fourteen inches you get to sandstone. ]	24
the availability?	7
budget  our money apparently. -	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
I hadn't heard, {D you know, } whether they have a new one or not.	24
-- {F um, } {C and } I like, as you know,  [ [ these, +  these, ] +  these ]  [ sil-, +  silly ] movies,	24
{C and } [ there is, + there are ] a lot of Mexican people here because we're so close to the border.	24
we have {D like }  [ the  medi-, + the dental  ] insurance is separate.	24
{F Uh, } {F uh, } blues are okay.	9
You hear about Japan. I guess, {D you know, } [ it's, + it's ] like two hundred fifty dollar minimum or  three hundred dollar minimum just [ to, + {D like } to ]  practice even  ((   )) .	24
{F Oh, } really,	15
Uh-huh,	15
# Uh-huh. #	15
Okay,	38
-- it's so nice to [ have, + ] come home and  find something, or someone who's really so happy to see you.	24
{D like } my mom likes flowers, so we have a lot of flowers too.	24
[ Th-, + the ] course is two are eighties and one eighty-six, {D you know. }	24
{C And then } also, that same day, you put out a small tub,	24
Yeah,	15
{C and } my other son is a senior in high school,	24
{C So, } {D you know, } if you can find me guilty,  then you ought to be able to pass sentence.	25
{C and, } of course, she needs walking --	24
Right.	15
{C And } it's like I said at our expense.	9
they consider it violent.	24
They contain the glue and stuff	24
{F Oh, } that's really weird.	21
{C or } if [ yo-, + you ] have a break in the middle of the day, you take a coffee break you can always stay informed.	9
Right.	15
seafood seems to be [ a lit-, +   a little ] bit more expensive [ than, +  than ] other types of food.	9
Someone whose got accounts in thirty-five different S and Ls or thirty or  forty thousand dollars -	26
{D Well, } [ I was, + I was, ] {F uh, } originally chosen primarily, I think, because I was a young fellow	9
In recent years it has just [ really, +   really ] changed a lot.	9
<<Very faint>> Uh-huh.	15
{C and, } -	26
[ what's the, + what's ] America's role there	16
That's got to be frustrating.	21
<Laughter> Exactly.	36
Yeah,	15
{C but } -- -- in some cases, yes.	9
Yeah.	15
# {F Oh } my goodness. #	21
What about you?	31
Yeah.	15
mortgage loan firms, aren't offering, {F um, } that loan.	24
{C And } I'm [ fr-, + originally from  ] Long Island.	24
{C And } of course, my kids jump in the middle of it and want to pound on  it	24
((   ))  we've had problems with our yard.	24
{D Well, } good.	21
<breathing>	20
{F Oh, } another west Texan.	22
I play tennis.	24
{C And } that's right outside of, -	24
Yeah,	4
That's, {F uh, } -	26
I was a resident, although very young [ of the sta-, +  of ] what is now the state of Alaska in nineteen fifty-nine when Alaska stopped being a territory and became a state.	24
It was on the stands prior to that time.	24
{F Huh. }	26
{C but } I can [ rem-, + remember ]  back growing up, my mother, -	24
Although neither one of us [ are, + are, ]  {F uh, } really {F uh, } {F uh, } dyed in the wool.	9
is your brother younger than you	7
{E I mean. } -	19
# {C And } # I don't, {D you know, } -	26
[ if, + if ] it said that. I feel I'm well enough equipped.	24
I got the model twenty-five.	24
{E I mean } I've never been to Italy, {D okay, }	24
I don't know,	19
in fact, I know what their long-term vision is.	24
Yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
That is a real cute show.	9
{C And } I've developed a real love for, {F uh, } classical music in, probably junior high and high school because my band instructor was, {F uh, } heavy into classical type music.	24
yeah,	15
That. -	26
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and then } all of a sudden something happens	24
If I do not feel very strongly about an issue, then I see no reason to go vote.	24
{C so, } -	26
Yeah <<faint>>,	15
{F Uh, } I was only on one jury ever, so far in my life,	24
she came home and everything in her house was total gone, light fixtures, everything.	24
Uh-huh,	15
If we travel or something, yeah. But, {D you know. } Standard, we usually don't.	24
Do you listen to much live music, like concerts or  things there?	7
{C And then } when the ship docks, you get to go sight-seeing and shopping.	24
{C and } [ I'm, +   I'm ] very good at making book shelves.	24
# Yeah. #	15
on the other hand, I can't imagine just being at home, {F uh, } although I have a lot of interests and a lot of things I would like to pursue.	24
no,	33
{C but } it's interesting.	9
{F Um, } he was strangling some of them.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yep <laughter>.	4
# Uh-huh. #	15
{F Oh, } yeah,	15
right,	15
-- {C and, } {F uh, } we're in the process [ of, + of ] planting --	24
I've always wanted too,	24
{F Oh, } really <laughter>?	12
it's like well, you know, you know, -	26
We have to contribute a certain amount,  {F uh, } to it.	24
inside. -	30
Wouldn't it though?	16
# {D You know, } # -- -	26
{C and } [ just, + just ] ever so often she mentions, {D well, } she's got to do something else, {D you know, } write another letter, or do something.	24
[ It, + it's, ] -	26
Uh-huh,	15
Yeah,	4
[ [  I've, + I've, ] + ] [ I + ] watched that late, {F um, }	24
{F Oh, } # yeah	15
You too.	38
A ring at all.	2
# Bye bye. #	38
I had [ two internal, + [ one, + ] {D yeah, }  two internal ] plane flights and a couple of other things.	24
I think you do get more [ by stimul-, + by stimulation. ]	9
{C and, } {F uh, } I live in the basic three bedroom, two bath home.	24
There's only a one in five hundred chance that the radiologist will call you.	24
what do you mean	39
{C So } that's why I concentrate on weekly magazines.	24
when you laid those bricks, -	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ A, +  a ] three twenty-eight G T S?	7
uh, and if you want to, you know, you don't touch anybody else unless you have their permission.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } I think they're very unfair in the  amount of penalties and interest that they can attach to that because [ you, +  you ]  will not only payback that that you wrote off	9
{C and } you have to have so many people sharing the same data, that you can't use personal computers,  so you have to use, {D you know, } a main frame.	9
You too, Tanya.	38
<Noise> Yeah.	15
{F um. }	15
{C and } I was wondering if you, -	8
# {C But } I catch # the news on the radio coming  to and from work,	24
what's his name?	39
{D Well, } it's supposed to be a jury of your peers,	9
Okay.	29
Yep,	4
No <laughter>,	33
{C and } the water takes the resistance.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
I think [ that's a, + that's a  ] contributor definitely.	9
{D Well, } there's a four year colleges.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } I think that's, {F uh, } easy entertainment for a, # family, # too.	21
money's precious.	9
-- {C and } it doesn't take that long.	9
there's been a lot of changes.	9
{C and, } {F uh, } it'll go up the coast quite a ways before it finally hits.	24
{C so } I got a Four Runner.	24
you'd think you would be.	9
Yeah,	15
Do you smoke?	7
I'm at home with two little [ ki-, + ] preschoolers.	24
-- {C so, } I'll be glad when the bins do come,	24
that's what I'm saying,	24
{C so. } -	26
I guess talking on the phone is one of my hobbies too.	24
I take it out of the right line total -- -- and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up.	24
# (( )) <laughter>. #	20
Uh-huh.	15
<Throat_clearing>.	20
Or, {D you know, } to find a job where they can learn how to support themselves,	2
{F Uh, } yeah,	26
{D See, } I didn't even think to look for that.	24
Uh-huh.	15
[  You, + you ] want to [ l-, + ] make it land right on the shore and then drag like a plastic worm -- -- and just have it come into the water like [ a, + a ] regular animal [ or, + or ] fish -- -- {F uh, }  {D well, } {D you know, } something coming off from the bank like  they usually do <breathing>.	24
just buy the colors that I need -- -- of what I'm low on.	24
Right.	15
this is Donna Donahue.	6
<Gasp>.	20
sure.	36
Uh-huh.	15
(( God )) , I'm envious <laughter>.	21
kind of like a domino's effect.	22
I guess they think that people don't watch T V,	9
it's totally different.	24
it may not be.	40
[ We do, +  we've got ] the direct sun in front	24
{C and } the food just comes out, -	24
{D Well, } my wife is involved	24
#Yeah.#    *[[slash error]]	15
That's something I didn't think that we'd ever do <laughter>.	9
Yeah <laughter>.	4
even if it's just kind of like this social drug use, you're still ending up supporting these big drug pin, {D you know, }	9
Whereas in this country where  everyone respects the closed doors very much, if you go out and then act like the lunatic  [ you, + you ] violate [ the, + {F uh, } the ] norms [ of social, + of, {F um, } public ]  behavior.	9
{C or, } -	26
{F Uh, }	26
to put it very bluntly, he could fry,	36
I've maybe worked five years out of our married life -- -- [ out of the ho-, + {D you know, } out of the home  ] --	24
they were against it, {F uh, }	24
What kind, h-, -	39
{F Oh, } great.	21
<Breathing> Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } gosh.	21
[ I, + I'm ] very tired of it all pays by the hour.	9
I guess Baltimore caught them.	8
I think you said Peter.	24
<Laughter>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
What about [ other, + other ] benefits?	31
This one guy had, {F uh, } framed himself to make it, -	24
Sevren is east, near the eastern shore,	24
I think they in, -	26
{C and, } Yeah.	26
Yes.	36
[ I, + I ] have a hard time sticking with something  -- -- [ {D like, } + {D like } ] on T V, because, [ it, + {D like, }  it ] gets real aggravating if you miss it, for a week or two.	24
{C but then } you would have a lot of money <laughter>.	25
Yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I, {F um, } help with her and bathe her and feed her.	24
{C and } they were going to put her into [ a, + a ] nursing home	24
the idea if we could get some cleaner [ fuel, + burning fuel, ] -	9
He stays out of the street	24
{C and } [ it, + it  ] didn't scare me all that much, {D you know, }	24
it's kind of hard to always feel <breathing>, gosh,	9
Yeah.	15
{C but } <laughter>, -	26
<breathing> I don't know <laughter>,	26
{C but } at least, {F um, } -	26
I sing in a church choir on Wednesday nights  when I'm around, and play in the band on Monday nights, and keeps you out of trouble that way.	24
I know, I, -	26
# {F Oh, } okay.  #	29
I did cut down a lot <laughter>.	24
Definitely.	36
{C But } teachers are asked to diagnose so much.	9
Uh-huh.	15
uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
it does.  {F Um, }	9
{C and, } -	26
<Laughter>.	20
It's the # one that everybody wants.	9
{C and } you set it out	24
I grew up in New Hampshire.	24
Uh-huh.	15
<Sniffing> [ Tha-, + that's ] [ just what, + just what ] you had,	24
{C So } I have put it aside for a little while,	24
<talking> <<voice in background says, Hi.  Speaker responds, Hi.>>  <<Speaker resumes talking>> I really do wish [ I, + I ] knew more about immigration laws because I have no idea any more. Because they've changed a great deal.	24
Yeah.	15
Yes <laughter>.	15
Right.	15
# Uh-huh. #	15
[ It's, + it's ] okay, {F um, }	9
{C But, } {F uh, } unless there is a big issue going on like when we were at war then I think everybody was glued to the T V to find out what was going on.	24
{C but } they <noise> keep  losing them all the time	24
{C and } then they changed the game.	2
{C and } if we  feel led to give a country money to help them, fine.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah <noise>.	15
{C and } [ I-, {C and } + I ]  used to enjoy John Chancellor's style of reporting,	24
Yeah.	4
[ [ it's, + {D you know, } it's ]  really, + it's really ] been nice.	24
{C And } [ I've, + I ] look at my paycheck	24
we got air mattresses.	24
I, -	26
one thing that I like, {D like } swimming, you like that a lot?	7
{C and } I don't know,	19
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } they have their own  quirks and tolerances and, {D you know, } certain things that  don't bother us at all, that would drive other people nuts	9
{C And, }  {F uh } -- -	26
{C and } did it get real cold at night,	7
Uh-huh.	15
I used to watch that.	24
That's just the end of me.	24
I know that certain states actually sell [ their, + {F uh, } their ] lists like, {F uh, } motor vehicles.	24
That's good.	21
[ {C and, } + {D you know, } {C and } ] [ they, + they ] don't have any intent to go working until they have to.	9
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } [ [ I really, + I-, ] + the ] last car we got [ was a, + was a ] used car.	24
I usually, {F uh, } {D you know, } -	26
{C and } I went	24
{D So, } yeah,	15
How did you like Africa?	31
Okay,	15
{D Well } as a matter of fact [ I'm, +   before we started this conversation I was ] working on my P C at home.	24
{C and } {D boy, } it is really nice,	24
{F Oh, } God.	21
Yeah,	15
{C but } I'm beginning to believe this is less civilized society than I thought <laughter>.	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
Right.	36
That was, {F uh, } pretty easy --	9
[ That, + that's ] true. #	36
we need to get serious about it.	9
That's right.	36
Yeah.	15
we, -	26
{C but } I enjoy all kind of sports.	24
Yeah.	15
{F Um, } {C and }  I've [ re-, have + ] no hope for solutions.	24
{E I mean, }  [ I, + I ] don't want to be around people who are really on drugs and that sort of thing,	24
Just never got a chance to come out.	2
Do you think, we should direct the government?  <Breathing>.	7
Yeah,	36
{C and } [ I, + I ] think one way or the other, we're going to pay  for the bureaucracy, I guess.	9
I, {F uh, } -	26
Yeah.	15
{F Huh. }	26
# {E I mean } # we used <<mispronounced>> to [ pay, + pay ] fifty cents an hour to baby-sit.	24
{F Huh. }  [ I, + {D well } I ]  don't even think we had <cough>, -	24
{F Oh, } no.	21
{D see } we don't have anything here in Belton.	24
{C and } we were hoping, {F uh, } to do  some camping in the van, {F um, }	24
{C but } I would assume that the productivity is way down, also.	9
yeah,	15
# Uh-huh. #	15
Yeah,	15
Oh, yeah?	12
I don't even know if there is a number that they allow in anymore.	24
Nigeria.	24
{C and } [ they, + they  ] destroy property,	9
(( Yeah,	15
[ we're, + we're ] in Plano,	24
{C and so } there's probably a lot of things I remember  and  a lot of things that I really didn't have a clue as to what was happening.	24
# Exactly. #	36
No,	33
[ That's, exa-, + that's ] just good old economics working.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } we have had to start all over trying to plant grass.	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C And, } {F uh, } I would like to try that one day.	24
# I'm home # at three o clock when the children are at home	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
Those things go fast.	9
{D Well, } we are, though <laughter>.	38
{F Uh, } we're maybe one hundred miles from Pittsburgh,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Oh.	15
Definitely,	36
{D So, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] do not, {F uh, } opt for, {F uh, } something that would be, <breathing> {D you know, } expensive -- -- {D you know, }	24
It's really good.	24
I think it's been nominated for twelve awards	24
Okay.	15
[ they, +  {F uh, } I think they're ]  different than a lot of other shows of which they have {D like }  the re runs in the middle of the season --	9
{C And, } [ that, + that's ] the way it would be.	9
[  I want, + I want ] happy, fantasy	24
Right.	15
Capital punishment.	24
Right.	15
Yeah <laughter>.	15
-- {C and } I believe in this,	24
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{F Um, } {D now } the Himie, we'll probably breed her a couple of times	24
{C And, } {F uh, } he's very well known around here.	24
{C but } [ we're + we're  ] [ about two hours, + about a two hour drive ] south of San Francisco,	24
{F Um, } [ the, +  the ]  flip side to this  is, are we getting what we're paying for,	7
definitely.	36
<Laughter>.	20
{C But, }  it is frightening	9
{C and } one of the reasons, I guess, is because there's so much more income in the family with both parents working.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	36
Uh-huh,	15
# {C and, } # {F uh, } -	26
{C and } in the wintertime I change to the sweaters.	24
However -- -- in today's environment -- -- it may be more critical to have the ability to interact in large groups, simply because that's the way our young people [ are, + are ] dealt with.	9
{D You know, } the more trash you have laying around the more bugs you get,	24
{F Oh, } did you?	12
{F Oh, } my.	21
{C And } if you go just a little bit ways in, I'd say about a fifteen minute drive in towards Salinas, # {F uh, } # the weather completely changes	24
that's what I wanted to, because [ I, + {F uh, } {D you know } I ] just couldn't wait to have kids	24
I just like to have the T V on [ if, + {D  you know, } if ] I'm home alone or  something --	24
{D Well, } they talk about it	24
{C And } [ m-, + I think most ] teachers realize the value of quality time with children --	9
in fact that's what we had for a Christmas party last week.	24
{C and, } {F uh, } -	26
I want to see her <laughter>.	25
{C So } I like that.	24
{C So } [ that's kind of o-, + {D you know, } that's kind of odd ] to me.	9
# Yeah.  #	15
Yeah,	4
yeah,	26
{D You know, } it's funny how you can just get in a mode where you only watch certain shows --	9
{C and } he's been to see  PHANTOM, and LES MISERABLES and bunch of other things up there,	24
{F Oh, } okay.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } I think it will be a long time in the future before it does happen again.	9
{C But } they're doing some stomping on <laughter> Virginia.	24
I'll say <laughter>.	21
Right.	36
Yes.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{F oh, } okay.	29
so many of the people will go back overseas.	9
{F Huh. }	26
there's, I guess, a lot of pressure in that business to, # borderline # at that.	9
# Yeah. #	15
Time spent with Mom and Dad [ is, <noise> {F uh, }  next, + is probably ] one of the worst punishments spent on earth to them.	9
Right.	15
yeah,	36
Uh-huh <baby_crying>.	15
{C but } that, # doesn't mean, -	9
I would go faithfully,	24
Yeah,	4
{C and } {D you know, } [ you, + you ] don't spi-, {D well. } -	26
At first I didn't realize, {D you know, } -	24
I found my kids were very frustrating when they were little -- -- in terms of their tastes.	24
{C so, } {F uh, } we were sort of, {D you know, } keyed in on expenses and things like that.	24
{C and } right now I'm just a little over about a mile and a half,	24
{F Uh, } [ I, + I ] don't know.	19
-- we better have him [ do + s-, do something. ] {D You know, } educationally.	25
{C So } it's pretty serious, really, {D you know, }	9
Huh-uh.	15
{C but, } {F uh, } they, -	26
That's right.	36
he was kicked off the team.	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ where, + where ] parents are spending less time, you don't have the families, [ too, + to  ] take up the gap.	9
<Throat_clearing> I'm not either	24
{D Well, } # -	26
<Music> Uh-huh.	15
I don't know if they ever get <breathing>, -	24
-- don't go out there and start digging holes, {F uh, }	18
Uh-huh.	15
{E I mean, } they really are over, # crowded,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
They say if nobody's injured, you all exchange names and take it up with your insurance company.	24
I know it.	36
{C and } [ I'm, + I'm ] going off, {D you know, }	25
{C and } you just flip <laughter> through it, and that sort of thing.	24
{F Oh, } yes,	4
{C And } I guess they've been using them for six months now.	24
Uh-huh,	15
{D You know, } where I can go see it.	24
{F Uh, } [ I don't, + {F uh, } I don't ] know whether we could do a whole lot as individuals.  {F Uh, } maybe just take good care of our cars, and make sure we keep our pollution devices clean and all that sort of thing.   {F Um, }	9
Uh-huh.	15
# Yeah, #	15
Oh.	29
{F Oh, } God <laughter>.	21
What other movies have you seen?	39
She likes it.	24
Tell you what,	17
{F Oh, } really?	12
{F Uh, } speech pathology.	24
Yeah,	15
Yeah.	15
<Laughter>.	20
Right.	15
{D Well, } {C and } with a daughter, nine, it is just, -	24
[ I don't really feel like, + {F uh, } I don't really feel like ] I use taxes very much <laughter>.	24
{D Well, } I never thought about that,	24
{D Well, } I primarily listen to classical music  when I have my druthers, partly because I find it more soothing.	24
{C and, } {F uh, } they haul you up to the headwaters, come down about halfway and then [ you + [ get to, + ] you ] spend the night	24
{C and so } I made a  special effort with my children to do things like that.	24
{C and } I suppose, {D you know, } I need a larger one.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } now all my blades need sharpening. Because, {F uh, } treated wood will also chew them up.	24
Uh-huh.	15
when he was riding back to the settlement and they shot his horse out from under him.	24
Rather than work with it.	22
Uh-huh.	4
#  (( {D Well, } [ that )) +   # -- -- that's ] all # right. #	21
{C But, } {F um, } {D you know, } -	26
Right.	15
{F Huh. }	26
{C but } they're also, {F um, } flimsy when you really look at them.	9
{D Well, } are you doing any kind of volunteer work now?	7
{C and then, } {F uh, } at night, {F uh, } [ I don't, + ] {F uh, } [ when I sit down, + I don't usually sit down ] till almost nine o'clock -- -- when my kids get in bed	24
totally.	36
No, {F um, }	33
[ It's just, + it's just ] such a change from, {F uh, } Texas because I had grown up with, {F uh, } the heat,	24
Yeah,	15
didn't he have a woman,	7
Something that's going to help them along the way.	24
Uh-huh.	15
true.	21
I <breathing>, {D see } that's the problem.	24
{C and } {D well } [ it used to be, +   <sigh> it's ] kind of hard to say now, especially after Desert Storm,	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
[ We have a lot, + population is a lot ] lighter up here.	24
there you go,	21
Uh-huh.	15
-- {C and } I, -	26
Right.	15
where they have [ the, + {D you know, } the ] little partition dividers, # throughout [ # a, + a ] large room	24
Right.	36
we're originally from the East.	24
let's say typical, <lipsmack> say three bedroom, {F uh, } two and a half baths, <breathing> on a half acre or so  of land <breathing>, {F uh, } <<pause>>  reasonable construction would probably run you, {F uh, } right now [ anywhere between, + somewhere between ] a hundred and a hundred and forty thousand dollars. And probably, perhaps, cheaper, depending upon the neighborhood.	24
{C but } I could be at work from anytime, {D you know, } from nine until nine at night or ten or whatever,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Right.	15
we're about ten miles south of Lake Ontario.	24
{C And } at first after it happened I thought, maybe that's a handicap access,	24
Oh.	15
{D Well, } [ if they, + if they  ] go up -	24
yeah,	15
{C but } I think that they were surprised to find it so low.	24
{D Well, } that's interesting because we have a simi-, -	9
{C And } you just have to set the time and say,  okay this is going to be it.	18
# {F Uh, } # that's kind of gone up in scale [ and, + <noise> and ] some other things.	24
{C but } I really do think sometimes they very early on are around lots of other children	9
Dayton, Ohio,	30
Eighty eighty-six.	24
Uh-huh.	15
a truck's a thing that [ [ yo-, + you, ] + you ]  need when you need it,	9
I don't know what it is,	24
{D Well, } [ I, + we ] tend to be pretty strong supporters of  Israel ourselves,	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C and, } {F uh, } -	26
You don't have kids hanging around you and stuff.	24
you got the problem with all your cars are still, -	9
{C And } sometimes just, -	26
{D like } if I didn't want somebody to come, then I just wouldn't send them one of the questionnaires.	24
Yeah,	15
# It's a fairly # decent book.	24
Yeah.	15
Saginaw?	14
{D Well, } ye-,  {F uh, }	3
# It just really, # -	24
Yeah.	15
{C but, }  {F uh, } I think [ the only, + the main ] thing is just keep on [ the, legis-, +  your legislators ] back, {D you know, } as far as, -	24
{C but } she has a bigger one than I do.	24
{F Uh, } in terms of doing away [ with  the, + with the ] unanimous jury, [ I guess, + I guess ] I, {F uh, } would be a little more leery of that kind of a change [ in, + in ] the trial system.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } okay.	29
{C But } I had a trumpet teacher that played in the Mexico City Symphony.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } {D actually } the, -	26
aren't they more of a running gun team ((   )) ?	7
I can believe that.	21
Yeah.	15
# Yeah.  #	15
yeah,	15
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } that's what I want, is a Shop Smith <laughter>.	24
they'll get into the trash,	24
{D Well, } {D you know, } I  was just looking at the news tonight,	24
# {C And } I'm sure # [ it's, + it's ] expensive.	9
{C and, } {F uh, } we have a lot of, -	24
{C And, } {F uh, }  [ [ I, +  I'm not, ] +  I'm not ] saying that that wouldn't have happened anyway,	24
What would I, besides tooling around and looking really cool -- -- and having a lot of fun, what would I really do with this car?	16
# {C And, }  {F uh, } the # university <<voices fade>> ... -	24
{C and } there was a comment in there about the Mexicans don't really want us to say, we're Americans.	24
A little town called Tuckaho, over by White Plains.	24
It was so funny.	9
uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } it's kind of hard to put my finger [ on a, + on a ]   favorite T V program,	24
They're {D like } all white,	24
It is.	36
yeah,	15
{C Plus } you have to have a place to store all of it --	24
What about you?	31
Yeah,	38
{F Oh, } that's a neat system.	21
# I don't # think, although [ i-, + i-, ] -	9
I don't have any children,	24
{C and } I don't watch T V as much really either, because,  {F uh, } my free time is kind of, -	24
-- {C and, } {F um, } though he's alive today and  everything worked out fine, [ [ it, + it, ] + it ]  happened about two blocks from the high school	24
That is odd.	21
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } I do have a boy in  junior high, too,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D you know, } made it more difficult to get [ [ a, + a, ] + {F uh, } a ] handgun. -	24
Yeah	15
{E I mean } they go right back where they came from.	9
{C And } MATLOCK is another good one I watch.	24
That's good.	9
Hopefully we're backing off from that a little bit,	9
# {D you # know, } I'll look over my husband's  shoulder and see what's going on.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } you probably, -	9
{C And, }  [ their, +  their ] fruits are always exceptional.	24
{D Well, } I can go ahead and start and tell you mine	18
what else do I wear?	1
I think we ought to worry about our own species.	9
[ {C So, } + {C but } ] he's reading it,	24
let me grab some of this money for my state now,	25
Sure.	11
I haven't been on  vacation in a while either.	24
{C And } [ it's on, + it's in ] Addison,	24
{C and } I don't know that it might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
What do you think,	14
{C so. } -	26
Right.	36
<Sniffing>.	20
{C and } I guess,  {D you know, } when you stop to think of it, these kids have probably been deprived of a lot of attention that they've needed all their lives.	9
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] an awful lot of people are in trouble.	9
I don't know.	19
I do, too.	36
{D well, } someone had, -	24
# [ They, + they've ] given that away for fifty years. #	9
Right.	15
# Uh-huh. #	15
{D Well, } that's probably a bonus on our part.	9
Exactly.	36
I still got a couple of years on it to go,	24
[ It, + they ] are just gems of shows. {E I mean, } [ they + ]  really, fabulous in every way <laughter>.	9
[ We, + I  ] think one of the most deciding factors of why we chose, {F um, } this area is that, {F um, } my husband was raised in Irving --	24
Yeah,	36
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
[ They, + they ] talk against drugs --	24
[  That's pretty, + that's a good ] size deck.	21
{C so. } -	26
It's pretty nice.	9
{F Uh, } a lot of reasons for that, [ not, + not ] just because  [ I'm a, + I'm a ] hard ass or anything.	9
It's kind of like [ a s-, + a nighttime soap ] opera type thing.	9
{C so } I think the newsmen, {F uh, } enjoyed, {F uh, } writing about him on his way down, {D you know. }	9
{E I mean, } [ I, + I've ] seen so many different things. [ So, + so ] many different bad reports coming out of the school system	24
{C so } -- -- we may see more slapstick.	9
{C But } [ I, + I ] personally cannot # see any use for them # -- -- other than, {F uh, } [ for, + for, ] {D like } people who dislike  ((   ))  have some sort of crazed -- -- {D you know, } ambition to [ use, + have ] high powered weapons or something.	9
that was good.	9
Judith Krantz.	24
I look back now	24
{F Um. }  {F Uh, }	26
that was, -	9
Yeah,	4
<Noise> Yes.	15
{C But } they had not, -	24
They can't agree on anything.	9
I'm a pediatrician.	24
Everybody might not like that.	24
You must be a  ((   )) .	8
That's the big thing, {F huh? }	12
# {C Or } you # go to Indiana on that?	35
Uh-huh.	15
How do you usually cook your deer?	39
{C So } she didn't feel safe.	8
We, -	26
[ it was, + it was ] real cold.	9
{F Oh, } that's what I've got,	24
they use Joe Blow's  [ so-, {F uh, } + social  ] security number, {F uh, } and can, {F uh, } potentially ruin someone's credit.	24
{C And } now they're trying to take some money away from the richer districts, like the one that I'm in, in Dallas, and make us pay our money to the smaller ones and make it more equitable.	24
Okay,	29
{F Oh, } I'm sure,	21
I think it's too easy for them.	9
I've been there.	24
{C And } [ that, + ] {F uh, } they ought to have equal opportunities to advance to those positions --	9
{C But, } -	26
{C and, } {F um, } <child_talking> seems like a people [ just don't, +   {E or } also don't ] have any family around.	24
I'm familiar with that one.	24
{C So } [ it was, + it was ] not good	24
{C but } it's sure, {D you know, } we're not anywhere near looking to, {F uh, } {F uh, } cut down in size.	24
okay.	29
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
I really don't know,	19
-- although [ during, +  during ]  the Presidential debates, there was some really nasty patronizing, stuff toward,	9
# {D you know. }  {C And } # [ that's, + that's  ] the way I, -	24
Really.	12
Sort of interesting,	9
Okay <laughter>.	13
[ she, + she ] likes, {F uh, }  action movies [ [ and, + {F uh, } and, ] + and ]  comedies	24
{F Uh, } <breathing> my home [ is, + <breathing> {D well, } is ] typical for the area.	24
-- {C and } I love music.	24
{C and } things weren't okay <laughter>.	24
Yes,	36
I've never had anything there that wasn't delicious.	24
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
<Laughter>.	20
{D well, } they're not rigid enough here, in Texas.	9
we have an aunt that lives out there	24
{C so. }    {C But, }  {D well, } it's been good talking to you,	38
{F Uh, } yes,	36
{D Well, } the elasticity of your skin, the collagen or whatever they call it.	24
[ They, + they ] abuse it -- -- is what they do.	9
O U has always been known for their running game.	24
[ He, + he  ] just learned,  like you, -	24
{C And, }  of course, it's pretty static right now	24
<Laughter>  {D Well, } {E I mean } he is still wearing [ bell bottoms jea-, + ] [ not bell bottoms + {E but, } flared pants. ]  {C And } he, -	24
Oh.	15
I mean seriously,#	9
{C and then } they pulled them apart --	24
You, -	26
Yeah.	15
{C But, } I brought, -	24
{F Oh, } they do?	12
sometimes they don't.	24
{C and } last year was the first year we tried two new things.	24
Yeah,	38
[ I + # -- -- I  ] haven't seen a one.	24
Got [ that, + ] {F uh, } {F uh, } some insight there, [ to, + to ] kind of help me put together the feelings.	24
{C but, }  that can be fun.	9
That's good.	21
{F Oh, } I know.	36
# {F Oh, } no.  #	21
we'd go on Sundays and visit, {D you know, } the older people.	24
Yeah.	15
-- {C and, } {F uh, } <static> of course, most of the homes are, {D you know, } fairly nice,	9
your # own school, #	2
{C and } I don't really perceive doing it unless we absolutely have to.	24
-- {C and } up there, of course they ate a lot of sea food, and that kind of thing,	24
# {F Uh, } {C but } I read, # {D you know } -	26
I got married,  {F uh, } during the Christmas season	24
{C So, } when the guy came over, he was infatuated by that skunk,	24
{C So, } really, it was always just money -- -- thrown away.	24
No,	36
{C and, }  it is too early yet.	24
and some of the stuff that they weren't supposed to do that somebody found out, you know, like in the middle of the night, they would go ahead and do it anyway.	24
{E I mean, } I think, {D you know, } normally [ they, + they ] may get out	9
{D You know. }  They can take your  car and your clothes and your, anything	24
Every time you drink Scotch, you're paying Kennedys.	9
yeah,	4
Uh-huh.	15
I'm sure it would in such a monstrous place down there.	9
{C so } -	26
yeah.	36
I though that was a really cute movie,	9
# Uh-huh.  #	15
Although I would like to experiment with, {F uh, } the meals my mother made, {D you know. } So to speak,	24
{C So } [ I, + overall, I ] think I would rather hear just straight reporting.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C But } there's a couple of those I've seen once in a while,	24
It's always have to have it now.	9
{C and } I thought phooey, I'm going to do it myself because I figured up the cost	24
I, -	26
I rarely go	24
this was,  {D well, } I am actually from Mississippi,	24
no,	25
{D So } [ [ what, + what, ] +  how ]  do you spend the time with your children?	39
{C And } that might be a partial solution, or something.	9
Yeah,	4
{C and } we've caught, {D you know, } fourteen, fifteen pound catfish	24
I never had either,	24
{C So, } -	26
{C and, } {F uh. } -	26
school's very important I'm an  educator myself and my wife teaches,   *[[ Seems to be 2 slash units ]]	9
uh-huh.	15
{C but } we sure felt like it was hurting us, just being there,  {D you know } <laughter>.	24
I used to be into coin collecting	24
{C and } computers have come in towards the latter end of that.	24
{D Well, } they are predicting rain  and thunderstorms,	24
It's a lot cheaper there, isn't it?	7
Yeah	15
especially we're going to spend the next eighteen years, # in # school <Laughter>.	9
I am not -- -- going to work -- -- after the baby comes.	24
{C and } they have a kid that comes in and helps them in the afternoon.	24
It, -	26
{D Well, } I like to watch the movies,	24
<Laughter>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
We did that too,	24
yes.	4
# I'm being # a Yankee, I guess [ I'm, + I'm ] letting my Yankee come out, {D you know. }	24
right.	15
{C and } it seemed like the further I got away from Dallas, center, {F uh, } the more  lot came with the house [ and, + and ] the lower the price,  at the same time.	24
<Laughter>.	20
<Laughter>.	20
that's where I picked it up.	24
{F Um, } there certainly have been ideas surfaced, {F uh, } recently, {F uh, } matter of fact repeatedly by many people	24
Especially, your foreign cars.  {D You know, } like a Honda or, {F uh, } a Toyota.	13
{D Well, } we do the same.	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
They're just horrid --	9
yes.	4
Uh-huh.	15
I'm # an old experienced hand.	24
I remember when they were coming home.	24
It's not, -	26
{D you know, } the l-, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
{C But, }  I think,  there would have to be a lot more, {D you know, } information, {D you know, } disseminated,  before you say, let's do this, {D you know. }	9
-- {C and, } {F uh, } I taught early childhood	24
Yeah,	15
I don't know,	19
{D well } -- -- {D see, } [ we have dif-, + we have ] marketing people,	24
# {C And, } # {F uh, } I've worked a lot in doctor's offices and hospitals	24
-- <Throat_clearing> {C and } last time our one twelve year old went to the scout camp for a week,	24
that's probably <child_talking> a major one.	9
{D Well, } I have two.	24
{C and } it goes into the full gamut of gardening.    {D You know, } everything from flowers to bulbs to perennials  to grass to weeds to trees and  [ to, + {F uh, } how to ] prune.	24
Yeah.	15
-- {F um, } {C and } it's a total of two thousand.	24
{C And } it was really a great relief when I got to Texas  that I didn't have to pay that city income tax, though.	24
{C But } [ I just, +  I ] kind of worry about getting a car that's that new with low mileage on it because you wonder why did the person that owned it want to get rid of it.	24
Yeah.	15
{C And } that's my favorite.	24
Huh-uh.	33
{C but } he's quite a character.	9
{D Well, } yeah,	4
{F Uh. }	26
this is the last week.	24
[ {C So, } +  {E I mean, } {C so } ] for me, -	26
Oh yeah.	36
{C And } I just felt so bad,	24
Yeah.	15
it really does.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } -- -- I got the <laughter> job that I wanted by applying [ the, + the ] methods [ that, + that, ] -	24
-- {C and } I really liked that, because, {D you know, } to me it had a point.	24
Yeah.	15
{C And, } {F uh, }  [ that, +   that ]  [ 's, +    gets to be, ] {F uh, } a deterrent.	24
Right.	15
{D Well, } <lipsmack> they're working on diapers, which would be great,	24
I've just been married seven months,	24
I think, after a while, [ they just kind of, +   {D you know, } there's ] no new stuff they can do,	9
they shouldn't catch themselves in that circumstance anyway.	9
{D Well, } we'll look.	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } she was too young to baby-sit.	24
Yes.	36
Sure.	15
{C and. } I really do if I have the time to.	13
{E I mean, } you don't know whether the person sitting next to you -- -- anywhere is on drugs or not,	9
{C so. } -	26
{C But, } {F uh, } [ [ [ i-, + it,  ] + it's,  ] + it's  ] real stressful to try to find anybody that I think's going to do me right. [ And, + and,  ] {F uh, } {D you know, } have an idea of what's going on.	24
[ [  I, + <throat_clearing> I, ] + I ] kind of feel like I wish I could have gone back to undergraduate now <laughter>.	38
we're supposed to have a  chance to get some rain the next couple of days here, {F uh, } which will be, {D you know, }  a little bit more typical, {F uh, } autumn weather. But really it's  strange.	24
{F Uh, } I certainly wouldn't want people's lives ruined -- -- # {F uh, } <noise> wrongly. #	24
# Yeah	15
[ {C and } -- + -- {C and, } ]  they made a heck of a threesome	9
{C And } the starter was Bosch American,	24
they get pretty expensive.	9
Uh-huh.	15
-- {C but } I think that's the way  we need to go.	9
[ {C but, } + {C but } ] still, [ it's, + {D you know, } it's ]  really [ [ not, + not, ] + not ] a good quality.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } [ it's, + it's ] really been a big fight because a lot of the people that live by the landfill don't want it expanded, because they're thinking that they're water is going  to be contaminated somehow.	24
# {C But, } {F uh, } # -	26
[ I, +  I ] am.	9
what, -	26
yes,	36
Yeah.	36
{C and } he does it so.	24
I've seen a lot of people use them,  {D you know, } for flower beds,	24
{C And } I suggested to him, Why don't you change.	24
[ I, + I ] like to see, -	24
I'm ready <laughter>.	11
{C But } I'm thinking of going back to work <laughter>.	24
{D Well, } good.	21
# Right.	36
okay.	29
whereas some of them are so far gone that they can't do anything good for society.	9
{F Um, } I know that [ my parents, + my mother ] is trying to let my grandmother stay in her house as long as she can.  {F Um, }	24
<Smack> Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
# Goodness. #	21
{C But } mostly they're from the area.	24
<Laughter>.	20
Is that right?	12
{C and, } -	26
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
local news concentrates, on murders and things like that.	24
Oh.	15
{C so, } -	26
{D Well, } we had, -	24
Plastic is just too easy,	9
I haven't done much recently,	24
{C so } that, I've been thinking about that for quite a while.	24
{C But } -- -- I was wrong.	24
I've had two or three of those go out.	24
we need to channel it and focus it on some  things [ that, +  that ] need some fixing up.	9
Yeah.	15
Okay.  {F Uh, }	13
<Laughter>.   *[[slash error]] Ouch.	21
Yeah,	15
# Yeah,	36
I have  ((   )) . -	24
yeah,	15
{C And, }  {F uh, } we had passed [ a, + a ]  provisional one that  [ [ if, + if it did, ] + if they did ] locate here we would raise our taxes.	24
{D well } not mutts, but mixes -- -- {D you know } like one or two mix	24
Oh.	15
Right,	15
Yes,	4
Keeping fish  ((   )) . -	30
{F Oh, } okay, {F um, }	29
They often do ratings of restaurants, #	24
# I know. #	24
{C And } I worked in a first grade  classroom for one full semester --	24
they put a probe in your exhaust pipe	24
It was, {F uh, }  defense [ [ w-, + w-, ] + won  ] all the games.	9
I do not know for sure either.	24
{C and } [ they, + they ] had the tent	24
Yeah <laughter>. #	36
# <Laughter>.  #	20
{F Oh } do you?	7
the, -	26
<Throat_clearing>.	20
I like it <laughter>.	24
I know <laughter>,	21
{C So } it's not very practical (( )).	9
I think there was four or five different people, that would call, # {D you know, } # some of them, if they didn't have their addresses and all on them,	24
{C But } then again each state sets its own	24
They didn't go off.	8
[ I, + I ] did grow up with David Brinkley.  {F Uh, }	24
Yeah.	15
That's a strategy I think [ tha-, + that ] the people [ have to, + have to ] take. [ Is, + is ] how to be able [ to, + to ] lessen their cost of living.  {D You know, }	9
As a matter of fact, my future is banked on that, {F uh, } professionally because I believe [ that, + that ] there are, {F uh, } pressing needs in the marketplace, unmet by schools, colleges -- -- universities for, {F uh, } learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching Sesame Street and in child care.	9
{C But } diesel engines.	26
yeah,	36
[ I would not have, + I would not have  ] said that.	24
{D actually, } we have a  very very, {F um, } -	24
My husband had [ a, + {F uh, } a ] police gun at one time.	24
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } I graduated from college in nineteen seventy-two,	24
{C but } I don't think we ought to be over there fighting it for them,	9
[ {C So, } + {C so } ] I don't know.	24
{E I mean, } it was the type of thing,	24
Uh-huh.	15
I see,	15
{C And } [ it, + it ] is fun for me to  do that.	24
they get one of these caught being good slips.	24
I've, {F uh, } two kids right now --	24
Yeah.	4
we did have a solar water heater when we lived in Houston	24
College programs belong to this T I A A,  {F uh, } C R E F retirement fund.	24
that -	26
# <Laughter>.  #	20
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } I appreciate talking to you.	38
{C and, }  in fact, Tokyo, -	24
# Uh-huh.  #	15
{E I mean, } [ they, + they ] kind of even brainwash themselves into thinking they're better, which is kind of hard to take <laughter>.	9
{C and } they're the ones wasting all the money.	9
{F Um, } no,	33
<Breathing> {C And } let them drop to the bottom  {D and } maybe do a, a kind of a slow reel.	18
{D well, } Jackson, I heard just the other day had their sixty-first murder this year.	24
And, you know, to, to see how little they can get by with.	9
{F Oh, } wow, that's great <laughter>.	21
<Barking> {F Uh, } Pennsylvania.	24
{D Well, } in the last two years, I have not played very much golf because I am involved in Boy Scouts.	24
Where does your friend go to to recycle?	39
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
we tried.	9
# Yeah. #	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } [ they don't think, +  they think ] what the best  is, is, reputation [ for, +  for ] research	9
he's a writer	24
I had one that I hated.	24
{C and, } {F uh, } I guess dress it up [ with a, + with [ a, + a ] ] very nice black jacket when I [ have, + have ] visitors or have to give talks.	24
# <child_talking> To operate, yeah. #	22
Okay,	13
we can't get involved  in their civil war, {F um, } unfortunately,	9
Right,	36
{F Um, } it looks more like a crab.	5
Uh-huh.	15
[ I don't, + I don't  ] know why it would be, {D you know, } {F uh, } bad to test just every-,	24
Nope.	36
let's see,	17
Yeah.	15
[ [  I, + I, ] + I ] -	26
Uh-huh.	15
Twenty thousand dollars a year, if they're lucky.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
I certainly haven't done that in sixteen years or whatever.	24
Uh-huh.	15
assuming you can buy into global warming I bi-, -	9
I'm envious <laughter>.	24
{C So } -- -	26
yes.	36
# they're # vested a lot earlier.	24
Uh-huh <noise>.	36
{C And } that's, {D you know, } -	26
Okay, {F uh, }	13
{C or } they think it's wonderful just to go to McDonalds, {D you know, }	24
<Swallowing> {C And } I saved them and built an oven  cabinet out of one and  another cabinet out of another by using the faces and so forth <throat_clearing>.	24
Yeah,	15
{D Well, } that's  pretty scary.	21
[ [ what, + {D now, } {F uh, } what ] particularly, + particularly what ] kind of music do you like?	39
it seems [ by, + that by,  ] -	26
[ they, + {F uh, } {D well } they'll  ] serve you at your seat	24
Miniature golf, there's my game. {F Uh. }	24
{C and } you can see her smiling from ear to ear, she's so happy to see me.	24
{D Well, } you too.	38
{C An } we got him a new one,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and then } it takes three weeks  (( and all )) .	24
Uh-huh <<very faint>>.	15
{C so. } -	26
{C And } I noticed that, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C because } I wasn't familiar with the, -	26
[ {C And, } +  {F uh } -- -- {C and then } ] the rest of it I just did.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Thirty day notice for what?	39
{C and } [ I, + I ] feel sorry for them	24
{D Well, } {D you know, }  [ we, + my parents ] were divorced	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } we would put it under the tree, and that I would keep it together,	24
{E I mean, } I didn't want to rush school at her the whole time,	24
The grandchildren. -	24
{C and } now it's kind of like, {D well, } -	24
there's not enough # -- -- beds and treatment programs, rising drug abuse,	9
{C and } we'd stay in people's homes,	24
# Yeah. #	36
{C and, } # [  I, + # I ] just hope that, {F uh, } more and more companies, {F uh, } get on the ball,	13
# Yeah. #	15
I have -- -- to put it away	24
Right.	15
-- # yeah,	36
{F Oh, } yeah,	4
{C or } you need a large reserve -- -- so that if you do charge on that account, you can make a single lump sum payment.	9
{C And } just the fact that I can go straight from my desk over to [ the, + the ] recreation center and do it helps a lot.	24
[ they just, + {C so } they just ]  (( washing )) , {F uh, }   watching their lawn just blow away.	24
Oh.	15
that's right, {F uh. }	36
{D Well, } {F uh, } a little bit, {F uh, }	11
{F Uh, } that was about a year and a half ago,	24
{C But } some things, especially letters, if they suggest certain colors for letters, I just go with whatever I want to.	24
{C and } I get out,	24
Right.	15
I meant living in Texas,	24
I don't know <laughter>.	19
{C And so } I've put a lot more emphasis on that, on my kids -- -- # to try and, # -	24
I know.	21
Yeah.	15
# [ I, + # I ] hate to see them just, {D you know, } keep getting diverted off to spying on other nations and putting up defense things	9
he's a pretty nice guy.	9
{C and, } {D you know, } I think they're worth the time,  {D you know, } because they, -	9
{D you know, } these are kind of things {D like } during the normal rat race -- -	24
Spaghetti, I guess, though.	40
Sure.	15
the cleaning people come through and they'll pick up recycled paper,	24
-- because he has to like himself -- -- before he can like other people.  {F Uh, }	9
{C And, }  {F uh, } [ the, +  the ] people kept harassing her [ over, + {D you know, } over ] a period of months	24
they are booked up.	24
We've been [ fifteen, + fifteen ]  years [ in the, + in the ] house that we're living in.	24
one semester the whole team  was required to take aerobics	24
Uh-huh.	15
Right <laughter>.	15
Yeah.	36
{C and then } I've just seen where the wait  attendance the wait staff is rude, {D you know. }	24
{C so } she can cover quite an area.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Right.	15
{C so } I guess we lucked out when we moved here.	24
-- {E I mean, } it's like, if you plan  a year ahead, you can probably save up seven hundred dollars -- -- {D you know, } one thousand four hundred  dollars to send your child to college, {D you know. }	9
It wasn't Stallone,	24
{E I mean, } think, [ [ the, +  he, ] + (( this chain )) ]  that must have been on President Bush  to bounce the first pitch off the ground, -	9
Mayb-, -	26
I had dinner Monday night with a Vietnam veteran who is just now beginning to  recover from the drug and alcohol struggle that he had.	9
Uh-huh.	15
<Laughter>.   *[[slash error]] Pardon?    *[[slash error should be 'br']]	20
{F Um, } we do take the DALLAS MORNING NEWS	24
Yeah,	36
# <Laughter>.  #	20
yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
# That's okay.  #	27
I bet you could too, # because # [ it, + ] {D you know, } kids have to learn  how to get along with other people,	9
He's a movie critic on channel eight in Dallas.	24
Yeah.	4
Good grief <laughter>.	21
I don't know if it's the saw dust or the mess you make or the smell of the wood	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	4
Pardon me.	14
{C and, } {F uh, } they've had some financial problems with the team and so forth.	24
It would be sort of, -	26
((   ))  [ It's get-, + it's maybe getting ] better.  {F Um, } a little,	9
The problem would just be the switch over.	9
-- {C and } they'd go up, {D you know, } and do things	24
Uh-huh.	15
Bye.	38
{F Uh, } {D now } Daingerfield is, -	26
Yeah,	15
right.	11
Uh-huh.	29
[ S-, + social ] changes,	24
-- {C and } they, -	26
# {F Oh, } the # weather.	2
{F Oh } I bet it is.	21
I know	36
{C and } I go into the hot tub.	24
I think that  we're paying too much taxes.  {F Um, } [ that, + ] including taxes in general or income tax,	9
My son's just in day-care	24
{C but } it's never different -- -- in a lot of ways.	9
I don't know.	19
{F Um. }	26
{F Oh, } {F uh, } by choice?	7
[ that's a, + [ that, + that ] is [ [ a, + a, ] + a ] negative, [ but, + {F uh, } but, ] [ [ not, + probably not at, ] + probably not a ] deciding factor,	9
{F Um, } at various places to look [ for, + for ]  cutting the budget, first of all I consider more defense cuts than are already planned -- -- depending on the world situation.	24
I guess if you had some really complicated stuff,	9
[ That's, + that's ] nice.	21
I enjoyed it there.	24
{C and so. } # -	26
Uh-huh,	15
but -- -- I had to take it in,	24
{C but, } {F uh, } even in baseball you can, -	9
[ Most pack-, + most software packages ]  will do that for you.	24
{C so } [ you ha-, # + you have ] been to some family reunions, perhaps.	8
{C So } you kind of have a combination.	9
{C and  then } I said, {D well, } I'll going along,	24
Yeah.	15
Primarily with our local newspaper and T V.	24
What part of the country are you in?	39
{C But, } -	26
go out and buy one now	18
they don't have basements.	24
{F Oh, } really?	12
{C And } where you exempt things, like, {F uh, }  {F uh, } one of the best things I heard on taxes to stimulate the economy, someone, brilliant deductor, probably Lloyd Bentsen, said that all, {D you know, } if they gave back the deductions  on credit cards on your federal taxes -- -- people would probably be, {D you know, } spending more  money using their credit cards.	24
Uh-huh.	15
For me, I wouldn't have time to do an [ hour, + hour ] of aerobics and then take a shower and [ get, + get ] dressed again.	24
Yeah,	15
# Yes.  #	36
Uh-huh.	15
{D You know, } it's amazing, to me and stuff that I didn't do until I was in junior high. # which, of course, shows # my age.	24
{C and } kids -- -- [ aren't, + aren't ] even going to understand half the humor that's in there.	9
That's, -	26
That's nice.	21
{F Uh, } [ I, + I ] have a question.	24
they ought to put those (( )) people to work.	9
{C and } I can't think of it.	24
isn't that terrible.	12
{C but } we don't fight over it or anything,	24
{C and } he's charging us about a  buck a square foot to design it	24
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } we have to keep talking, I guess <laughter>.	9
Go get her.	25
{C So } that's all you need for {D like }  ((   ))   charts and stuff.	8
[ {C So, } +  {C but } ] [ [ [ I, +  I's, ] +  I, ] +  I ] put that against, {F uh, } my high school  where we had, {F uh, } a biology class of three hundred and fifty students	24
{D Well, }   we, {F um, } let's see, -	17
If you come in at the wrong angle, what happens is they bounce off and go back into space --	24
and, and issues get, uh, bogged down.	24
{D Well } thank you.	38
We're kind of, {F um, } -	26
I recognize [ there's, + there's ] over crowding problems	24
<Laughter>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
I was just wondering that <laughter>.	38
could you stand there and watch them beat that guy.	16
Oh.	15
# Yeah,	15
{C and } he always threatens that when I spend more than, what's coming in, I have to go back to work --	24
[ I, + I ] do enjoy cooking	24
{D like } she has to have {D like } a little  toilet right by her bed	24
{C and so, } -	26
Exactly.	36
Yeah.	15
you learn it,	25
{C And } it's something we can do together,	24
It's pretty soon.	9
True.	15
{D So, }  for me it's actually a pretty good topic.	24
{D Well, } since I have had kids, it is kind of funny.   [ I, + I ] never really was much of a garage sale shopper until I had kids.    *[[ 2 slash units ]]	24
{C but } <laughter>, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
{C And } it, it comes in a bottle,	24
we just went ahead and laid them down.	24
Uh-huh.	15
<Laughter>.	20
I thought that was a real unusual thing, for someone to do.	9
One of the secretaries we have down  here is paying twelve percent through G M A C or something.	24
{C and } just recently I've changed my job to actually do some of the marketing.	24
--  ((   ))  truck, {D you know. }	24
I will look you up in the fall then.	24
# That, {F uh, } -	26
[ So, + so ] that's, I think, one of the reasons I don't need to budget is that [ [ I don't have, + I don't, ] + I don't have ] to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because I can't afford it, because I'm not interested in that expensive thing.	24
I've heard the name	24
Okay,	36
{D well, } I live outside of  Dallas	24
{C So, } I then read, was it BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM,	24
there's nothing that he has [ that, +  that ] you could go after.	25
Yes,	4
If they're above the knee they turn into shorts, {D you know. }	9
{C but, } {F uh, } I don't know,	19
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } price-wise, it was great  because he did it all himself, {D you know, }	24
{C but } it wasn't, {D you know, } too easy either.	9
# That's true.  #	36
<Sniffing>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
least I, -	26
{C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } [ what, + ] [ they, + they ]  covered everything from entertainment to spreadsheets, {D you know, }  and then [ they + ] -- -- also, the hardware.	24
{C so } -- -	26
[ he gained, + he actually gained ] from it, {D you know, }	24
{F Oh, } that's good,	21
{F Oh, } goodness.	21
the guy I was talking to never goes,	24
{F oh, } I honestly don't feel like it's strict enough in my opinion.	9
Right.	15
Yeah.	15
I use to [ watch one, + watch one ] on the air,	24
{C But } [ they, + they've ] got so much young, raw talent,	24
I guess, as far as people like, {F uh, } our family, we can feel like sometimes we pay more than our share as middle class [ people with, + Americans with ] -- -- {F um, } college age -- -- students, {D you know, }	9
Takes a long time,	30
Uh-huh,	15
{D Well, } they don't,	5
#both.#  -	26
[ that's, + that's ] kind of a problem for them.	9
[ I, + I ] really enjoyed it.	38
the same I know the abortion issue with right to life and right to choose -	9
# Uh-huh. #	15
That's correct	36
{D Well, } [ how do you, + how do you ] feel about, {F uh, } companies drug testing prior to hiring?	31
I'll try the middle of the afternoon.	25
{C And } that was, a few years ago?	8
it's a story of all the politics and, {F uh, } lobbying and just basically state  by state events, that lead to the events that brought about the  Civil War.	24
Do you have any children?	7
this is a federal law, controlled by the Treasury Department. {F Uh, } for fully automatic weapons.	24
Uh-huh.	15
I've   nailed the problem down	9
-- {C and } one boy who had been drinking  decided for some stupid reason to try to play with the train.	24
and, um, <lipsmack> I don't know.	19
uh-huh.	15
{F uh, } you ready to begin?	7
{C or } do you, use insecticides?	35
{C but } I think he's stopped pretty much now.	24
I just think it should be [ [ a little, + {D you know, } a  little, ] + a little ] more regulated.	9
{C but } we gained a playroom  for the kids and an office out of enclosing the garage.	24
Okay.	29
it wasn't really that expensive,	24
{C and, } {F uh, } I guess, -	26
Okay.	13
I think that's neat,	9
that's pretty awesome, too.	21
{C or } do you, -	35
{C And } we have that happen.	24
it's not as much of a stigma not to work as it was for a while there.	9
[  I, + I ] roll it in bread crumbs and,  {F uh, } Parmesan cheese,	24
Yeah.	36
[ I, + {F uh, } I ] kept hearing noises	24
You do?	12
Just walking that's all <laughter>.	24
Uh-huh.	15
How important you think that would be.	24
{F Um, } {C so } that's good.	24
Uh-huh.	15
we come home	24
{E I mean, } Dallas is a very marked up <breathing> area,	24
That's true.	36
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } I really am,	11
Uh-huh.	15
I have book shelves	24
Two.	24
Yeah,	30
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
Oh.	15
((   ))  I'm a college professor,	24
Yes.	36
I thought about that.	24
# Yeah,	15
Okay.	15
{C and } he had run up, {F uh, } more than a years salary [ in, +  in ] various  debts to,	24
It is, because they, -	24
[ {C and } + <breathing>, {C and } ] a lot of the buildings in downtown areas [ that, + that ] {C either } need demolishing, or need fixing up, -	24
<Laughter> {F Oh, } it's not too bad.	9
{D So, } -	26
{C and, }  I do, -	26
You know where he says kill all  the lawyers <laughter>.	8
[ It's really, + {F um, } this has ] opened my eyes to thinking, {D you know, }	24
Right.	36
you know, comes right into my air conditioner	24
{C and } couple lives in Pittsburg,	24
{E I mean, } <laughter>  probably would have paid the same amount	9
(( Yes ))	4
{C so. } -	26
when it would snow in Texas -- -- {F uh, } [ I would just, +  {E I mean } we'd ] be [ f-, + really cold  ]	24
{D Well } tell me	18
it must show in my face.	24
Sounds interesting.	21
like everywhere else, {F uh, } -	9
{F Oh, } mercy.	21
{D Like } [ what, + {F um, } what ] type roses?	39
That, -	26
It's just different.	9
Yeah,	15
Most, -	26
yeah.	15
{C And } I have experience  with this, because I work at [ both, +  both ]  as a director of music and also as an associate under a man.	24
No,	33
{C and } when I see the money that's poured [ down the, +  down the ] drain on  Medicare and Medicaid, -	24
{C but, }  {F uh, } it has been ruled against, {F uh, } regarding air pollution because they think that it's causing terrible smog over the Grand Canyon. And, {F um, } particularly in the winter months.	24
# Yeah,	36
[ {C But, } + {C but, } ] I really enjoy it.	24
Uh-huh .	15
and, and that was some of the best tasting water,	9
I have to <laughter> do it the other way,	24
{C And } I was thinking that you needed to put some waivers in there for the handicapped and also for people that had to stay  home and maybe be wage earners for their family,	24
the last time they went up, a friend of his wanted to go,	24
<Laughter>.	20
Right.	15
That's probably where I first started, was in Girl Scouts.	24
Yeah,	15
Oh.	29
-- most of them do.	9
Yeah,	15
# {C and } # you have less accidents	9
It's, like, {F oh, } man.	9
Three and a two year old.	30
if they go back to the inner city, they may not see trees for a while, much less be able to take care of them <laughter>.	9
# {C and } # we do a lot of take out because everybody's so busy running around,	24
{C and, } {F uh, } he checked body fat content --	24
[ they, + they ] claimed they did the best that they could [ have + have ]	24
Okay,	13
{C But, } I know, we already have a new money system.	24
[ {C but } + -- -- {C but } ] I enjoy doing it more when I've got  other people with me.	24
It's designed to be added on to.	24
We're just not real big movie goers.	24
{F Uh, } they're, -	26
# But there's so many more people, # that are homeless	2
<Noise> <<someone is walking>> Yeah.	15
Yeah,	15
I really enjoy it,	24
That would be good.	36
exactly,	36
it's right on a big lake,	24
{C and, } of course, if it's all white you're all right	9
No,	33
{C and } I was even able [ to, + {D you know, } to ] accumulate some savings in a sense in the checking account, because I'm pretty thrifty	24
[ one of the, + {A there were four  high schools in my county, } one of the ] high schools was blown away by a tornado.	24
I'm in favor of it.	24
yeah,	36
Do you?	7
{C and } it's got  the pinchers like a crab.	24
in the winter time I usually plant some pansies in there,	24
some of the stuff is pretty boring.	9
-- {C and so } that has made me, -	24
[ We had, +  {F uh, } a week ago they had ]  golf ball size hail coming down in one part [ of the, +  {F uh, } of the ] city of Dayton itself.	24
You're making one more months payment every year.	24
what part?	39
yeah.	15
they just [ put it on a charge card, +  put it on account, ] and then pay off the bill because they  want it now.	9
Right,	36
[ What's, + what's ] your most recent one that you've seen?	39
{D Well, } that, -	26
{C but } we will probably be going up at Thanksgiving this year,	24
Yeah,	15
Right,	36
{C but } I have the morals that keep me from, {D you know, } -	24
{C and } I # put them up # -- -- # mulch [ [ ar-, + around, ] + # around ]  the other shrubs, and, {F uh, } {F uh, } [ had, + had ]  a pile of dirt from various things, {F uh, } back by the garage that I filled in with	24
Have you faced, {F uh, } elderly care yet, {F uh, } nursing home care for any of your parents?	7
{D Well, } {D see, } my sister kind of got in the opposite  end of that, because [ they, + they ] moved into a neighborhood and bought [ a, + a ] real nice  stone house down in South Austin.	24
{C and } I think certain entitlements  [ I, + I'm ] inclined to agree with you, too.	24
[ [ I, + I, ] + {F uh, } I ] transferred to Delaware and graduated there.	24
{D Well, } we went on a family cruise  last year, on the Premier Family Cruise Line <baby>	24
{C and } it's healthy, too.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } when I bought the car that I bought now, I did that also	24
The little guy is so cute,	24
That's true.	36
[ I, + I ] can't see paying an annual fee for it.	9
I had one lady one time	24
{D Well, } I'm a drafter,	17
they do.	24
# we # actually live in two different places right now because she has her job.	24
{C So } it really, -	26
no,	33
We've got to be able to get a handle on what is happening	9
Uh-huh.	15
{E I mean, } I can go in there,	24
And I think, uh, the big city, uh, -	9
Yeah.	15
No, {F um. }	15
{C but } with practice, I would imagine you could groove that swing, too.	24
there was nothing over here.	24
[ I think that, +  I think that's ]  part of what, {F uh, } baseball needs more of.	9
I realize that's true	24
I think that's what upsets me worse than, that they're getting a little,   {D you know, } {F uh, } on the side -- -- [ that, + that, ] # it seems that when they # get up there [ it's, + it's ]   [ what, + ] if I vote your way, what it'll do for me # rather, # than this is the way my constituents want it.	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ I, +  {F uh, } I've ]  never, -	26
yeah.	15
Not at all.   *[[slash error]] Yeah,	36
{D Well, } what is it?	39
We did not get to see the end of the game.	24
I didn't send them back.	24
I don't know what we're going to do as a country.	24
I get a little  leery of the real small ones <noise> that they don't get much interaction with  kids	9
the market was so good,	24
I don't know that I could do that.	24
[ it's, + {F uh, } it's ] easy to keep up on current event-,  {D you know } -- -- [ on cert-, + ] -- -- {D you know, } especially when [ you, + {F um } -- -- {D you know, } you ] get a paper every day.	9
Uh-huh.	15
<inhaling> we have engineers who, {F uh, } go out [ to the oil well, + <thumping> [ to the, + to the ] client's oil well, ] [ and, + and ] work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff,	24
it is,	24
Uh-huh.	15
he was like, {F uh, } -	24
it's like the street people that are starting to show up all other the U S, [ is that, + ] that's essentially an underclass	9
I've never done it myself -- -- unfortunately,	24
they want to see all the horror movies.	8
{F Oh, } did you return it?	7
I haven't had that much,  of course	24
We don't have the vision care,	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C but, } I've never had to have a front end alignment on a Cadillac.	24
[ {C and } + {C plus }  ] [ for, + for ] the type of student that's going to that school,  it's going to raise the level of the school -- -- because your parents are engineers or chemists.	9
the government specifications,	9
{C but } I hate watching the, {D like, } ten o'clock news	24
yeah,	15
it's nice.	9
No,	32
If it's not a whole bunch of everything at once -- -- type stuff.	24
, yeah.	26
Exactly <laughter>.  {C And } th-, -	21
Well <<pause>> <lipsmack>  <<pause>>.	26
that's -	26
# {C and } # I think that was the extent  of it to the best of my knowledge.	24
{C so, } I'm, {F uh, } -	26
You can't just watch them by yourself or else, it's not bearable.	9
huh-uh.	33
You have to get back in the sticks in the, -	11
{D Well, } [ I, + {D actually } I ] don't know a lot about different brands.	24
Yeah.	15
I'm not a I'm Mexican food gourmet by any means	24
{C and } we don't want to  (( smush ))  their creativity, {D you know. }	24
The last one I saw was DANCES [ OF THE, + ]  WITH THE [ WOLVES, + ((   ))  WOLVES. ]	24
They've got three daughters.	24
Yeah.	15
{C but } as the years go on, if you're with the company for any length of time then it gets much better	9
Uh-huh.	15
You don't think that's strange looking.	8
i-, -	26
Really?	12
Right.	15
well HEADLINE NEWS repeats every half hour	24
{C so, } I try to do things like that,	24
I haven't  ((   ))  the Wilson class. -	24
Yeah,	15
{F Uh, } right.	15
You really have to watch those interest rates.	24
{D Well, } I wish that's all we had.	21
<Cough>.	20
Yeah.	15
job. {F Uh, } one of the drawbacks, I think, of working for a big company, is often times, you do have to follow pretty rigid, {F um, } <throat_clearing> guidelines,	24
<Laughter>.	20
{E I mean } it, alleviates your problem	24
That's been one of the arguments here.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Wow, } [ [ that's, + that's, ] + that's ] a nice size carp.	21
{C So. } # -	26
{F Oh } really.	15
{C And, } {F uh, } I would like to go to Ireland.	24
Right <laughter>.	15
{F Uh, } {C and } Christian literature. -	24
I need to be here for them.	25
food and junk to carry out.	22
{C But } [ I was a lot, + I was a lot ] more impressed with her than I thought I would be.	24
as far as the quality of the streets, the school systems, {F um, } the hospital stuff that the government gives money to.  {F Um, } the, {D you know, } all the things that the government does like that.  [ I, + {F uh, } I ] think they need to manage it a little bit better,	9
[ it's a, + it's a ] great role model for everybody.	9
My current one has been the most successful.	24
Wonderful touch tone telephone there.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Period.  #	13
{F Oh, } okay.	29
Yeah.	15
# {F Oh, } okay. #	29
-- {C so, } it, {F uh, } has worked out quite  well,	24
that's not,	26
Unbelievable <sniffing>.	21
while I was waiting for you to connect, [ I, + I  ] thought of a couple of menus,	24
[ I, + I ] read as I said, [ and, + ] {F uh, } quite a bit.	24
That's really nice to find out that it's behind there <laughter>.	24
{D Well, } -	26
If it's the lot where it's funded by the individuals <lipsmack> -	24
You just couldn't believe [ that they would, + that they would ] be mean, [ [ [ and, + and, ] + and, ] + and ] drop bombs and kill people,	24
about a year ago, we picked up a second hand, {F uh, } {F uh, } Audi --	24
{D Well, } there isn't really much  to talk about as far as lawn and garden goes.	9
{F Oh, } wow.	21
I agree.	36
Very good.	21
Pappasito's.	30
# Yeah. #	15
I wonder if they thought about it themselves or whether someone, somewhere is really thinking, that, {F uh, } it would be a good idea to have everybody spend some time in public service.	7
{C And, } {F uh, } I think the only way that  can be changed for us to get [ a, + a ] better tax revenue that's fairness and all, is for us to limit their terms.	9
you go through college	9
{D so. } -	26
I could just walk in the door	24
{C and } we just, have lots of people from everywhere. Lots of industry coming in,	24
Yeah.	15
{C And so } with that, why, our lawns do  stay, {F um, } {D you know, } pretty nice all summer, if you water.	24
{D You know, } he was, {F uh, } allowed to, -	26
{D well, } when I got pregnant, I went ahead and quit work and decided just to stay at home	24
Yeah,	15
{C and } he didn't go back for more,	24
uh-huh,	15
{C but. } [ It's, + it's ] kind of hard.	24
okay.	15
{F Um. }  Then your kind family is probably pretty rare now a days.	9
[ Did you ev-, + Did you ever  ] do the James River?	7
That means one of the points of it.	24
I think they're there,	24
[ I'm the, + {D you know, } I'm the  ] opposing teams best player, [ so, + so  ] to speak,	24
{F Huh. }  # {F Oh, } those # -- -	26
Eleven,	30
they'll get into  it.	24
{C But, } {F uh, } it will be interesting to see (( )).	9
{E I mean, } they just couldn't believe this	24
I think they're maybe going to give us a state income tax.	9
<Laughter>.	20
So I didn't even,  I didn't really, uh, even bring it up when I went in to pick it up.	24
{C because, } it used to be they were draftsman <laughter>.	24
{C but } [ it, + it  ] was, {F uh, } a way of, {F uh, } triggering, {F uh, } awareness.	9
oh,	15
And for that price.	2
In engineering?	8
Do you sing or knit or anything?	7
Yeah,	36
I think T V is bad.  Because they, {F uh, } show all sorts of violence on, -	9
Uh-huh.	15
yeah,	26
{C and } [ it's a very, + it's an excellent ] automobile. [ [ And, + {F uh, } but, ] + ] {D you know, } price and so forth,	24
Yeah,	36
the office, -	26
{D you know, } you lear-, you adjust, you figure out,	9
{F Oh, } we have one rotten cat.	24
Yeah,	4
# {C And } they, -	26
{F Uh, } I'd started playing when I was in elementary  school actually.	24
{C and } it was.	24
-- {C and so } I would work	24
(( BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM )) .	30
Really.	12
{C So } you quit.	24
yeah,	15
Uh-huh,	15
This country kind of takes the worst care of the elderly of any other country.	9
I think, that's what the class that meets on  Saturday mornings.	24
{D Well, } that's funny,	21
I, {F uh, } sell a, {F uh, } healthy cookie on the side.	24
Yeah.	15
I guess if this is the only place you've lived, Lubbock is a lot different than Dallas.	9
Uh-huh.	15
[ what, +  what ]  are the titles,	1
This plea bargaining baloney, where, {F uh, } {D you know, } they plead to a lesser crime, or, {F uh, } they plead guilty [ in, + ] or, {D you know, } tell about someone else   and [ they, + they ] get less time, -	9
The unanimous vote is questionable, though.	9
that's true.	36
{D So, } air quality.	24
Right,	36
[ [ I, + I'll, ] + mostly I'm ] into it for relaxation,	24
{F Uh, }	26
{D So. } -	26
{C But } thanks for talking to me.	38
It cost us less money	24
Yeah,	26
{E I mean, } the beaches are nice,	24
{C so, } he's really interested in the heart.	24
Right,	15
{C and }  I talk to them,	24
{C and } I'm thinking when I get older, [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] think if brought all my precious belongings with me, I think I could live in a home.	24
# I never # felt spoiled.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
{F Oh, } yes <laughter>.	36
[ The, + the ] same here <laughter>.	24
{C and } -- -- {D you # know } you really, # -	26
[ I have a, + I have a ]  self-propelled, {F uh, } Snapper.	24
Uh-huh,	15
we're not on city water,	24
Yeah.	36
{D Well, } there's not a lot more I can think of to discuss on clothing.	24
That's, -	26
[ it was, + it was ]  the scab teams,	24
I guess, he's a big help out in your garden.	9
{C So } I think if I had a big home and a big lawn [ I'd, + I ] don't believe I would enjoy it.	24
Yeah.	15
you don't have to go.	25
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] resale value is really important to me <laughter>.	24
Wow.	21
You kind of think this is got to str-, -	24
{D well, } we have high rises,	24
{C and } I've actually been in the drinking watering business since eighty-three.	24
{C and, } {F uh } -- -- we baby-sit quite frequently.	24
{C And } I backpack a lot over the summer.	24
Uh-huh.	15
# {D Well, } # [ [  that, + that's, ] + that's ] hard.	9
once you get into some of the programs <breathing> that are out now, you can do so much with them, that you don't do until you really make yourself use them.	9
right?	23
I know a lot of  it here in my state, -	24
He [ doesn't, + Doesn't, ] -	24
we have forty,	24
{C and so } we're, {D you know, } enjoying not having [ that, + that ] payment [ every, + every ]  month	24
{C and } you need to be very careful,	9
Uh-huh.	15
we got lucky.	38
Uh-huh.	15
uh-huh.	15
probably the only thing, sometimes we'll take [ cash + {E or } the cans ] in	24
{C And } I really, {D you know, } -	26
Ooh.	15
Yeah,	15
we have a dog,	24
normally that would interfere with college, I would think. #	9
[ We, + {F uh, } we ] used to live in an apartment	24
Uh-huh.	4
{C but } I got talked into the bike instead.	24
{C But, } {F uh, } I don't know,	24
{C but } I'm sure that will be good.	38
I think in general, {F uh, } <sigh> punishment in  the United States is a lot weaker than it should be.	9
it is.	24
{E I mean, }  there was a time, {E I mean } where, I remember when I was real young, I just loved Harry Truman.	24
No,	33
<Throat_clearing> Uh-huh.	15
Is that the new, -	26
Okay.	13
well, -	15
{C and } my husband was raised, {F um, } on a working farm near Dayt-,	24
yeah.	26
{D Well, } {F uh, } I guess it's one of those things that, {F uh, } if it's going to really promote a lasting peace, if there is not going to be a peace, -	9
Put them back <laughter>.	24
Yeah,	15
-- okay.	29
{C but } I'm troubled by too close a clinging [ to, + to ] the past	9
yeah,	15
-- {C and } I was going to dig them up for a  friend and for some starters for me,	24
{C and, } That's probably why we get so many people.	9
{C but } I think if you take more than three children in, {D well, } -	24
{C and } I don't know why we couldn't have duplicate voting on some of this.	24
Do you?	12
{C an. } -	26
Do you like Ken  ((   )) ?	7
I understand that.	24
{D Like } cheeses or fruits or vegetables or, -	35
Uh-huh.	15
If you have [ an, + an ]   ((   ))  optometrist or an ophthalmologist, there's a vast difference in those two, {F uh, } professionals.	9
I guess it'd be best if you  knew each person and what they stood for and why and everything.	9
That's the vibration dampener,	24
-- {C And } I'm looking at him like, Jeez.	24
[ Y-, + ] -	26
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
it is.	36
{D Well, } [ he, +  {C but } he ] has even, -	24
I could certainly see it being done	9
Uh-huh,	15
{C And, }  {F uh, } I read magazines mainly because they're fast	24
{C and } I know they've changed it a lot and upgraded everything,	24
{C And so } I go, okay, {E I mean, } you just,  [ you + ] did <laughter>, what you wanted to do,	24
{C And } I think that really makes a difference.	9
Is it.	36
<Inhaling>.	20
{F Oh, } my goodness.	21
{C So, } that just creates, -	24
bye-bye.	38
{C and } it's in the sixties,	24
# Yeah.	15
That's really pretty out there.	9
{D Well, } last week, as a matter of fact, my children was on Spring Break --	24
I tried exercise classes,	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ I just, +  I ] usually fall asleep <laughter>	24
{C so } [ [ I, + {D you know, } I, ] just, +   if I need cash, I just ] tell him	24
# That makes sense.  #	21
{C but } he wasn't there yet.	24
{C but } I don't anymore,  maybe once or twice a year.	24
How about yourself?	31
Uh-huh.	15
Miss Nancy, we should be in business now.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C But } I'm ready to have a President elected that at least has some sort of a domestic agenda,	24
Right <laughter>.	15
I think # so. #	36
{C but } the, {F uh, } camper had, {F uh, } beds in it, {D you know } -- -- when we had that one,	24
{C and } I understand it's supposed to rain until Saturday night.	9
[ That's, + that's ] what the T V stations do.	9
{D Like } five pairs of socks and, -	9
{C And } [ I've, +  I still love ] it.	24
{C so } it's, -	26
-- {C and } then I'll just forget it.	24
# {C But, } # -	26
That's right.	36
{F Uh, } {C and, } {F uh, } let's see.	17
I think it's a pretty good, -	24
See [ I, +  I ] no-, i-, -	26
<Child_yelling> {C So } I kind of just have  taken a back step away and, {F uh, } hopefully that someone will clean up the mess that's there.	24
No.	33
Yeah.	15
{C So } what you do is, you strip off, {F oh, } four, five, six little rolls, coils, of line into your hand.	24
{C and } that's it.	24
Uh-huh.	15
if they don't say, no annual membership on them, I'll throw them away.	24
<Laughter>.	20
he says, {D well, } I think this is what it is,	24
{C and } I, {F uh, } made the tuna fish sandwiches.	24
Yeah,	36
and you have everybody else.	9
{F Oh, } {C plus } we watch a little T V together.	24
Yeah,	15
{D well } Rochester is {D like } right on the shores, isn't it?	7
Okay.	13
{C but, } I know, that, {F um, } for a lot of the civil cases it's rare, -	24
A mobile home's a heck of a lot cheaper,	24
{D Well, } good luck to you in pursuing your nursing degree.	21
that's probably true <noise>. # {D You know }	36
[ it's a, + it's, ]  Riverview, Ohio or some place up there.	24
# <Laughter>. #	20
[ The, +  the ] job is what provides  all of your needs,	24
Rarely a day went by when the wind was  less than fifteen or twenty miles an hour. Summer and winter,	24
I'm not really, -	26
if you, -	26
Let's go around this tree,  and -- -- {D you know, } try a slice through a hook here,	25
# {E I mean, } I hate it # <laughter>.	24
{F Oh, } my gosh.	21
Really?	7
<Inhaling> We just have the case,	24
Right,	36
{F Uh, } it's a local radio station.	24
{C But, } {F um, } now my children [ have, + have ]  sometimes, -	24
It teaches them pride in their country.	9
{C And } they can tell me, basically some  things that I don't know <laughter>.	24
Right.	15
Okay.	29
they sure could.	9
it did.	9
{D well, } is that right? <laughter>.	12
there's a joke about I B M which says, {D you know, } it's like, {F uh, } -	24
{C but } then they'll raise it somewhere in the state or the sales tax or property tax or  whatever.	9
# It # is obvious.	9
Uh-huh.	15
yeah,	26
Right.	15
{D Well, } it does # <laughter>. #	11
That's a lot of fun.	9
Yeah.	15
And, uh, -	26
yeah.	15
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] this is why.	24
{C and } it has grown from there.	9
Uh-huh,	15
I'll be fifty-seven in June,	24
It's just primarily the price that's, {F uh, } satisfying at this point. #	24
{F Um, } yeah,	26
Yeah.	4
[ It's, + # it's ] awfully easy. #	9
{C but, } {F uh, } it was kind of interesting because she was kind of the strict one,	9
college is not for everybody.	9
What was the other thing?	39
Is that right?	12
my son was driving,	24
uh-huh.	15
Him just standing there.	9
Uh-huh.	15
that's what I do.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
Yeah.	36
{F Oh, } okay,	11
{C or } building supplies place.	35
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } it wasn't until I was thinking about it just now that I realized that's actually something that's culturally relative.	24
Everything had a little bit of curry in it.	24
No,	36
{F Uh, } {D well, } Brian,	26
[  I + <breathing>, when I ] bought the computer, all of a sudden I was receiving them, for some unknown reason, through the mail.	24
No.	33
<Sigh> Ugh.	15
Yeah.	15
<Laughter> {D Well, } I have been to California.	24
{C But } it -- -- # probably takes # -- -- a lot.	9
It did pretty well,	24
{C And then } what you have is also [ {D like, } + {D you know, } {D like } ] three different kinds of salad.	24
Yeah,	15
I've used, {F uh, } many a gallon of them, myself.	24
Yeah.	15
{C And } you let it come to a boil again	18
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Do you think the verdict  should be completely unanimous by the jury?	7
{C but, } -	26
{F Uh, } [ I st-, + I want ] to see the FISHER KING [ and, + and, ]  {F uh, } catch ROBIN HOOD.	24
Uh-huh.	15
<Throat_clearing> {F Oh, } I am sure they would {D you know. }	36
Okay.	29
{C or } how, -	26
DESIGNING WOMEN is on that night, # too. #	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C So. } -	26
{C but, } {D you know, } there's only so much one person can do.	9
{C but } it just wouldn't be, {F uh, } smart for me to do that in my home with my children.	24
{F Oh, } you do a lot then.	22
yeah.	27
{F Oh, } yeah.	36
Uh-huh.	15
That was my brother's first job in a grocery store.	24
{C And } here we were all hep to go to Woodstock, {D you know. }	24
I think [ that, + that ] [ if, + if ] there is a problem with the school system, {F uh, } [ from, + ] it's been my perception that the school teachers and school officials are not that well, {F uh, } paid. That perhaps that might be one area [ that, + that ] could be improved.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } to us, {D you know, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{D so } <laughter>, {D you know, } the competitor,	24
No.	33
{C and } like I said, my sister's still in it,	24
Yeah.	15
{C so } you know.	26
{C So } it's pretty scary.	9
{C so, } that's [ one, + one ]  way he looked at it.	24
{D well, } thank you.	42
I really, -	26
{C so. } -	26
They, -	26
{C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } this is one of the big things with kids.	24
Yeah.	15
# Uh-huh. #	15
yeah,	36
I've lived in Texas most of my life.	24
# {C but, }  # {F um, } some of these people are just out and out brutal.	9
that makes such a # difference. #	9
Is that right?	12
That's  ri-, -	36
# {E I # mean } [ I like, + {D you know, } I like ] Costner,	24
{C and, } the first year we were there it was kind of like, eight hundred dollars,	24
Uh-huh.	15
I don't know.	19
{C So, } do you have any [ art, + ] {F uh, } {A how do I say it, } creative or artistic # hobbies? #	7
[ he, + he, ] [ do-, + does ] that a lot,	24
{C And } most of the seafood's frozen.	24
Uh-huh.	15
What if we would have lost thousands of young men.	16
{C And, } {F uh, } yo-, -	26
Right.	36
[ He, + he's, ] {F uh, } just now really starting [ to, + to ] get interested in a lot of things, <laughter>	24
one is, did it really happen the way [ the, + the ] prosecutor said it happened, {D you know, }	16
{C so } I will just stay up and finish a book that I am, -	24
no,	33
Yeah.	15
yeah,	26
That's what always amazes me, {D actually, } [ is that, + {F um, } is that, ] {D you know, } -	24
You, too,	38
Right.	15
I,  -	26
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	36
{E I mean, } on the other hand, {E I mean, } you take a garbage man in New York City starts out at twenty-six thousand dollars.	18
how long have you had them.	28
she said <<imitating a woman>> [ My, +  my ]  best friends are lawyers <<imitating a woman>>  and {D you know, } all this,	24
{C and then } we ended up with four grandsons.	24
{D Well, } I'm trying to think if I ever even had a favorite one at one time, {F uh. }	24
[ my family, + my dad ] was,	24
{C But, }  {F uh, } otherwise [ w-, + as I said, we ]  have had, {F uh, } a relatively mild winter, speaking for this area of the country.	24
{C so, } they benefitted tremendously by leaving the Mavericks.	24
Uh-huh.	15
That's a great position to be in.	21
{C But, } {F uh, } next year we'll probably buy a new car	24
Yes,	36
Uh-huh.	15
Did you?	12
[ {C but, } + {C but } ] I've really, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } I wouldn't mind, {F uh, } {D you know, } getting back into one if they would,  {D you know, } -	24
Do you use credit cards a good bit?	7
{C or } they think they're not going to get caught	9
Yeah.	15
Sure would.	9
{C but, } every year  it just seems to hang on,	24
do you?	12
I didn't know that.	24
{F Uh, } when I was in high school we had a choice of, {F uh, } taking, {F uh, } physical education courses on exercise,	24
It makes sense because, {D you know, } [ you, + you've ] got the flexibility if they're good athlete they can, {D you know, } do a bunch of different things.	9
{C And } it's nice too.	9
Uh-huh.	15
How about yourself?	31
{D well } [ you'll, + you'll ] get a couple more probably.	9
{F Oh, } [ you do, + you do ] {D actually, } {F uh, } grow a garden to produce food?	7
{C so, } it's, no fee, or subscription either to read at my leisure	24
{C but } {F um, } {F uh, } we haven't found one yet.	24
{C And, }  {F uh, } I don't know whether that's bad or good,	24
Yeah,	4
Of course, I don't,  {D you know, } -	19
That's right.	36
[ {C But, } + {F uh, } {C so } ] when you are first going to school [ that, + ] you kind of  have the luxury of being able to -- -- have some latitude in choosing the place to go.	9
I sell NuSkin, too.	24
{C But } it was, in, -	26
Every time it comes up it gets voted down.	24
Yeah.	4
# {D Now } do # you have to have tickets ahead?	7
yes.	15
{F Oh, } {D well, } <laughter> actually I'm  from California	24
Right.	15
that's great.	21
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
{C and } I used my mother's recipe,	24
# Isn't that something.  #	16
All right.	15
But, uh, I guess the activities that, uh, we have with them are, uh, pretty few and far between.	9
not, -	26
# Yeah.	36
[ I just, +  I ]  bought the cloth and the pattern for it.	24
# Oh.  #	15
Bye-bye.	38
# {F Oh, } wow.  #	21
Uh-huh.	15
Of course, he sat along the sidelines all season,	24
The rec-, -	26
{C And } I imagine you still have a very  close relationship with them.	8
I don't want to say three months,	24
yeah,	4
{C So, }  by the time I traded it in it was ready.	24
Yeah.	15
I guess I got too many hobbies	24
{E I mean, } {C and, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } have you seen PRETTY WOMAN?	7
{D Well } I've enjoyed talking with you.	38
# Yeah. #	15
we've taken that this year, and said we're going to pay off all of our  credit cards	24
{C because } there are other people around that,   {F uh, } -	24
someone gave it to him when he was in junior high school,	24
Yes,	36
here you are to the logistics of the thing again, {D you know. }	9
{D Now } [ th-, + that ] [ [ y-, + s-, ] + you ] can still, {D yeah, } -	26
{C but } as far as, {F uh, } you know <laughter>, you're pretty much bullet proof in this state.	9
[ {C and, } +   {C and } ] [ that was a, +   it was [ a, +  an ] ] [ un-, + ] I guess, {F uh, } <throat_clearing> United States institution.	24
Pump,  yeah, *[[should this be two slash units?]]	30
# [ when # I, + when I ] do my chores up at  the rad-, -	24
{F Uh, } we <throat_clearing>  kind of, -	26
I guess today [ that would be, + {F uh, } some how or other there would be ] a program of some sort that would take care of that sort of thing,	9
Yeah.	15
I must not have understood the whole thing	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ That, + yeah, that ] is a scary thought,	36
I'm not certain that that was, -	24
{F Oh, } okay.	29
Uh-huh,	15
That's where you swim.	9
Yes.	15
Just one.	30
{C and } we undertook a building house.	24
It all depends on what I'm fishing for, and the time of  day.	24
<laughter>.  Yes,	15
What's your favorite T V show?	39
{C And } dropping the prime is probably one of the things.	9
Oh is that North Carolina?	7
the cars are different years, but the same Chevy V-eight.	24
# We # -- -	26
Yeah,	15
Oh.	15
Yeah,	36
Right.	15
What are you guys having for Christmas?	31
they are going with their farm system.	9
{C and } probably just got home.	8
Uh-huh,	36
{C and } a few things we had to do that <breathing>, are part of it that you don't really like,  {D like, } {F uh } <breathing>, making decisions on living wills and -- -- extended care, that type of thing,	24
Fifteen years.	22
{C And, } -	26
{C And } we got a few, {D you know, }	24
Right.	15
{C but } I sort of have a liberal political slant,	24
{F Oh, } that's a pretty big fish.	9
It's not exercised very often,	24
Oh.	15
[ Hope, + hope ] the stud will find her attractive.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Right.	15
{F Um. }	26
I think it cost me three dollars a square foot and, {F uh, } {D you know, } no less than that.	24
I want that <laughter>.	24
{C and } now I'm down to about four	24
{D so. }  {D Well, } {F oh, } I talked about this the other day,	24
Uh-huh.	15
<laughter> I can -- -- imagine that.	21
{F Um, } I don't know,	34
it really does bother me when I think about, {D you know, } leaving our children [ with, + with ] this sort of, {F uh, } a national problem that we can't seem to find [ an, + an ] answer to it, {F uh, }	24
Yes.	15
Yes.	15
Uh-huh.	15
I think we did.	36
{C and } I know just especially in the last, {F oh, } ten years and really since, -	24
I don't know how long <laughter> <child_talking>.	24
[ it, + it ] comes right on [ through + -- -- through ] the screens,	24
{C So } [ that, +  that's, ] {F um, } {D you know, }  <throat_clearing> -	26
And like I say, with C N N and, and, uh, the cable news.	24
{C And } do they have the death penalty there?	7
{C and, } {F uh, } I felt really good.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Quite frequently. -	24
I don't like strange people coming to my door, {F um, }	24
{F Oh } no.	21
{F Uh } <laughter>,	17
<Laughter>  Roberto died while we were  [ down + ] there as a matter of fact.	24
Political things don't interest me a great deal,  except I do like to stay informed enough to, feel like  I halfway vote intelligently, {D you know } --	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } [ the, + the ] [ mu-, + ] Miata was first introduced, {F uh, } -	24
{C And then } we had another guy, {F uh, } Ronald Lafferty, that thought God told him to kill his sister-in-law.	24
# I guess I am # -- -- for certain cri-, -- -	24
{E I mean } it has been a real, {F uh, } -	26
{D Well, } I'll tell you.	37
it's a lot of work -- -- {D you know, }	9
I'm afraid you're right.	9
does California have a, -	7
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
[ {C but, } + <laughter>, {F um, } {C and then } ] when I used to come back to the states in summer we'd often go up, {F um, } to the lake country in New York -- -- with my brother's family [ and, + and ] do camping there.	24
[ Have you, + have you ] ever done anything at all?	7
that's for sure.	9
we don't really eat out too much.	24
(( One day ))   I would like to, {F uh, }  {D you know, } the,   {F uh, } -	24
I said, you got two choices kid,	24
Until you pull the pin,	3
{D You know. }  Right now there's a lot on the market for sale because of people having lost their jobs, and everything	9
{F Uh. }	26
{C but } anyway, {F um, } [ I just, + I've ] never liked D C a whole lot	24
All right, Ron.	36
Yeah.	15
that's true.	36
They get real crazy.	24
[ {C And so, } +  {C but } ] the thing [ is, + is, ] that, {F um. } -	26
{C because } you don't have to worry about unpacking or anything like that {D you know. }	24
{C And, } {F uh, } then it doesn't bother me very much.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
Especially, I did some cabinets in, {F uh, } ash and oak --	24
{C Or } [ do you, + do you ] know in Virginia [ whether it is, +  if they have ] smaller juries	35
I try to tell my kids  [ just, + just ] kind of be aware of what's around them, {D you know }	24
-- {F uh, } I don't know whether there  will be an increased amount [ of, + of ] surrogacy that we see.	24
They're not willing to tell the truth.    The same way with, {F uh, } issues of, {F uh, } race and things like that  <throat_clearing>.	9
-- {C but, }  {F uh, } you just took a  roller and put it on there,	24
{C But } it's too  hot to be working in the yard.	25
I may have filled out [ on the, + on the ] form,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } that would be great.	9
we've spent the last twenty years in Oklahoma.	24
{D Well, } there's that	36
Yeah?	12
[ {C But } for now, + {C But } for now, ] we have a lot of ice and snow in the wintertime and, {F uh, } cold weather. And that type of thing.	24
[ {C And, } +  {F uh, } {C and } ] the point [ of, +  of, ] I guess, -	26
{C Plus } if something goes wrong, I know who to blame.	24
uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	36
What's the best part about it [ to, + to ] you, [ the, + the ] quiet, the getting away?	39
{F Oh, } that's good.	21
{D like } in the winter when it wa-, -	24
{D You know, } they feel like they've lived life	9
yes	26
Yeah,	15
You guys   <child_talking>, {F uh, } do you  get much of a chance to hunt or anything	7
{C but } it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage.	9
I had a [ hundred, + hundred ] sixty horse, {F uh, } <lipsmack> Murcruiser in it.	24
{D like, } {D well } heck,  everybody's got one, {D you know }	9
{C but } [ I d-, + I also think ]  that's, at least in my experience, truer of girls than boys.	9
It's, uh, I mean it's news is not, not that way, -	24
{C and, } {F uh, } he graduated and went off to college	24
{E I mean, } not that [ I, + I ] think that I'm equal to men because there's a lot of things that men can do that I, <breathing>  could never do strength wise and so  forth --	9
we have family that's far away.	24
{F Oh, } absolutely.	36
and it was treated more, like a, like a taxi driver <laughter> type job, #then a,# then a doctor type job.	9
{C and } I sold seven.	24
# Yeah. #	15
What about yourself?	31
Yeah.	4
it's really, really nice.	24
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C so } that's. -	26
# Just a # little shell to go under a suit, {D you know. }	24
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] you're staying within your  budget and [ keep-, + ] everything is working pretty good.	8
I've been trying to learn as much as I can about it,	24
If you want to stop the crime, I think you've got to get, {F uh, } the people when they are kids.	9
-- {C and } you can give me eighties --	24
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] also, {F uh, } [ the, + the ] issues they deal with, {F uh, } really tends to [ open, + open ] your eyes as well as your mind to some of the problems.	9
Yeah.	15
[ That is, + that is ] a problem, {F uh, }	21
[ {C and } + -- -- {C and } ] it was a little bit hard to, {F uh, } wind down,	24
{D Well, } that will be interesting.	21
{C because } [ I, + {D you know, } if ] somebody  has been convicted and has been sentenced to be put to death, how is it that they can appeal and appeal and appeal and get stays of [ ex-, + execution? ]	16
{C and } in Germany they don't have the jury system.	24
People would always bring them when they go to the countries,	24
{C so } it wasn't too hard for them to come in the day and leave.	24
# For instance, # -	26
[ I, + we ] [ will probably + will ] put [ some things up. +  Some posters and stuff up  ] <lipsmack>.	24
Uh-huh.	15
we thought even with all the cold weather weather we have had they have been blooming just fine.	9
{F Um,  } how do you like it?	31
It's really awful.	9
{F Uh, } once I get my son into and through with college, he's going to be starting, {F uh, } Rice next year	24
yeah,	15
{F Oh, } # okay,	29
-- # {C and, } # {F uh, } <lipsmack> it really, -	26
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } yeah,	36
Yeah,	15
I wouldn't mind just calling up the grocery store and giving them my order and -- -- going an hour later and picking it up <laughter>.	9
{C And, } {F um, } what about the whole situation with the refugees, the Kurds?	31
{C But, } -	26
Five dollars a call?	14
I was a W F for several years,	24
[ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C so } ] [ I don't, + I just don't ] like anything that I can't figure out why it doesn't work <laughter>.	24
my, good, you're a picky eater, if I can get you to, -	25
{D Well, } people think you burn it, it's gone,	9
{C so, } {D you know, } -	26
# {C But, } the problem is # ,  {D like } first time I went out of here, [ and + ] they took me to Las Vegas --	24
I know a lot of places, they, {F uh, } {F uh, } -	24
Except you get to taste the product instead  ((   )) .	9
{E I mean, } my wife and I, seems like we get home at five thirty and the damn phone starts ringing -- -- and rings up until ten, eleven o'clock sometimes.	24
{C and } I, as far as, {D you know, } -	26
Yeah.	15
{C and } occasionally I'll watch them on channel eleven,	24
{F Huh. }	15
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } really.	29
{C but } there's a lot that can be done right here in this country, too.	9
{C and } they  (( don't ))  even have a dozen applicants because, {F uh, } {F uh, } the kids are going off after the big money.	24
At North Carolina State University.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D well, } it was good  talking to you	38
{C and } sometimes we'd watch the weather stations.	24
Uh-huh.	15
more than five minutes of a basketball game, just seems about, -	26
I take the paper every day --	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C so } <lipsmack> I got [ a, + a, ] {F uh, } nine and  a half percent interest rate.	24
{D Well, } we had (( ni-, wh-, )) growing up	24
{C and, } {F uh, } they had this bill, {F uh, } that she had bought such and such amount of merchandise, {F uh, } over two hundred dollars worth of merchandise.	24
Sure. Uh-huh,	15
Uh-huh <<very faint>> <clink>.	15
{F Oh, } okay,	29
# {C but, } # <Laughter> {C But, } [ you, + you ] can't say that that was right.	9
{D You know, } if you start talking about miles,  they'd look at you like,  what.	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } I'm mother of four,	24
it'd start squawking.	24
{C and } if you didn't have any choice -- -- [ on, + {D you know, } in ] who you go to, -	9
Yeah.	15
{D you know, } they've got it made,	9
naturally.	21
{C And } I thought this would expose both of  them to what it's, {D you know, } like on a [ coll-, +  a smaller college ] campus.	24
Good talking to you	38
{C And } that is unreal, # because we've # got people out  here that are just poverty level.	9
[ that, + {C and } that's ] what I hate doing is the finishing stuff.	24
Um.	15
Right,	15
Those little kids don't understand it.	24
{C because } [ I thought +  lord, I thought ] I lived in a halfway decent area.	9
Oh.	15
{C and } that would be a nice way, especially if you have young children.	9
{D Well, } I think the key [ for, + for ] L A this year is whether Oral Herschiser can come back.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C But, }  {F uh, } I don't have any plans for probably another two, three years of even looking, {D you know. }	24
Yeah <<faint>>.	15
Bye,	38
{C But } we don't like to go there because  that's the most expensive,	24
yeah.	36
{C but } it's nice talking with you.	38
[ It's, + it's ] on the Oklahoma-Arkansas border.	24
{C and } we wear them, {D you know, }	24
It's probably middle-class housing there.	9
I don't know exactly what it is.	19
{C And } [ it, + it ] seems to be working out	9
{C and } you've got to pay a lot, {D you know, }	9
there were Lake Shore, -	24
Yeah,	36
Okay Nancy, then I guess  [ the, + ] today's subject is benefits -- -- in the job other than salary.	24
{F Um, } as far as college teams, {F uh, }  I know it's really easy to say,	24
I spent the weekend in Ohio with my family --	24
# I think that's part of the problem. #	9
My goodness.	21
It was nice talking to you.	38
{F Oh, } yeah,	38
Stuff like that really <laughter>, -	24
{F Oh, } I see.	29
that was really on the  national news a lot.	24
{F Uh, } we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have.	24
{D Well, } that sounds like something good to do then.	9
{C And } the American people, when this first started, they were even reluctant to let them do that.	24
{C but } -- -- right now we haven't had any,	24
Uh-huh,	15
{C and so } I'd leased this one for two years.	24
Huh-uh.	15
{F Uh, } yes,	15
{C but } it's too costly for us.	24
{C or, } -	26
{D well, } we should probably get another, {F um, } Visa card, [ ye-, + ] [ one, + another one ] that's free.	24
# Right. #	15
Just, {F uh, } can't take the risk I did as a dumb teenager, I guess <breathing>.	24
All right.	6
Right.	15
Just about.	11
Yeah.	15
I think, -	26
Right.	15
I listen to K R L D, and, {F uh, } {F uh, }  K L I F, the news talk radio.	11
{F Oh, } uh-huh.	29
{F Uh, } for the operating staff it's  [ on a seniority, + it's, {D you know, } based on how long they've worked there. ]	24
they can be black holes to throw money into <laughter>.	9
{C and } of course people are denying it.	24
{C but } that's how we got into a problem.	9
No.	36
{D Well, } tell me about your home.	18
[ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C and so, } ] {D you know, } [ [ we, +  we ] don't,  + there's lots of things that we don't ] get told. For good reason.	24
{C so } I get, -	26
# I know. #	36
{C And, } my, {F uh, } {F uh, } father and stepmother are not in  very good health.	24
I was in the, {F uh, } Defense Electronic Division when I retired.	24
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah,	15
we, -	26
# {C And } # I guess it's all one big game  because [ you, + you ] just never run out of places to go,	24
the only thing, this DANCE WITH WOLVES, I want to see it in a theater.	24
I used to like to read about royalty a lot.	24
{F Oh, } there's no doubt about it.	21
{F Oh, } okay.	15
[ [ I, + I,  ] + I, ] -	26
I've had that happen,	24
{C And } [ I, + I ] really think that [ we're, + we're ] falling by the wayside with not incarcerating these people.	9
# Right. #	15
It is amazing how fast you take off the inches --	24
That's exactly what they were trying to get them to do.	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C and so, } {F uh, } [ that, + it's ] kind of a seasonal thing.	24
{C and so, } {D like } my roommate went home,	24
our   first fifteen years or eighteen years of being married nothing worked <laughter>.	24
Oh.	15
Presentation	22
True.	36
uh-huh.	15
{C but } we try not to.	24
We just bought a new house.	24
{C But, } it's an interesting point, though, that, {D you know, } everybody's so  anxious to recycle,	24
<sigh> She still had her individuality,	24
I've, we've, we've, we've kind of been the types that will say, this is what we intend to spend,	24
Right.	36
{C and } we saw  one movie recently	24
[ {C And, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } they ... -	26
# [ That, +  that's ] true. #	36
{D Well, } that's a good way  [ to, +  to ] [ make + ] a little extra money.	21
{C but } I'm just afraid [ it's going, + it's going, ] # to break # us.	9
it did. #	11
<Laughter> enjoyed talking to you.	38
-- {C so } here if you don't water it just looks awful.	24
Right.	36
{C And } I just don't think that this -- -- # doesn't always get emphasized # -- -- anymore, {F uh, }	9
{C so } [ I, + I ] felt pretty fortunate about that.	24
<Noise> <<like a telephone buzzer>>.	20
I didn't hear that.	24
{D Now } I had a lot of friends who went to the Peace Corps, {F uh, } back in the mid sixties --	24
Not, -	26
Yeah,	36
<Laughter> There is a whole lot of stuff going on out  there	36
{F Oh, } neat.	21
I could go on and on about that.	24
the Lincoln ride is certainly good, too,  but [ the, + this  ] Lexus is nothing like I have ever been in before.   *[[one or two utt?]]	24
What about, [ when, + when ] would people do it, when they finished high school?	7
{C So, } {F uh, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
# Yes.  #	15
I rent my kids <laughter>.	24
No.	36
What about your home?	31
it is <laughter>.	36
All right.	21
this would make a lot, right?	7
What kind?	39
Yeah	15
she would go her way,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I got to make him dinner and stuff	24
{C but } if you get on the, the, {F uh, } grassy kind of part, you get a little bit of traction, {D you know, } not slip and fall.	9
That, -	26
[ that's, + that's ] the stereotype that's very strong down there, {D you know, }	24
we do,	24
That's right.	36
# Both? #	14
I think that a majority of the places in the U S, {F uh, } {D you know, } there is some government aid available,	9
[ I, + {F uh, } I ] used to [ could + ]  be able to name ten shows or so, {D you know, } that I felt were worth my time to  watch,	24
{C and } when I went to college I think everything in my closet, I had made.	24
{D You know, } [ I, +  I ] really do not know.	34
No,	36
I do not -- -- know what we would replace it with <laughter>.	24
{C and so } they're going very nice places,	9
Yeah.	15
[ {C but, } + # {F Um, } # {C and } ] we take  [ [ my dental, +  my dental, ] +  his medical. ]	24
-- {C and } [ I, + I ] don't know how a coach would feel [ if, + ] that teaches health or  [ Eng-, + {D you know, } English, ] or whatever that they had to wear a tie.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Right.	15
{F Oh, } is she still there?	7
Yeah,	4
it just kind of seemed to be the magic number for them <laughter>.	24
{F Uh, } the U S isn't the threat that we've always made them out to be, {D you know, } even if they're saying that beneath the doors.	9
{C And } he will go out and get himself into trouble and come home,	24
the problem is that [ it   hits, + the sun hits ] it.	24
Huh-uh.	15
Yeah.	15
There's, {F um, } {F uh, } Jan Hooks from SATURDAY NIGHT LIFE.	24
every hole.	22
{F Oh, } that's their project  too, isn't it?	7
{D you know, } when you're first married or starting out, you think if you really have something,	24
{C And, } {F uh, } {D all right, }  now for instance, in California where they passed the {F uh, } {F uh, }  semiautomatic -- -	24
I'll remember the name.	24
# Yeah	15
<Gasp>  # Oh. #	26
{C so } I could see that as something that might occur in the court system for those that are troubled,	9
{C And } we lived in [ those, + those ]  third ones	24
yeah,	4
{D Well, } hi.	6
{C and } camping is not near as much fun.	24
{C But } as you climb up that tree, pretty soon [ you're, + ] [ the, + the ] branches get smaller on the top of the tree --	9
I've got two little ones	24
yeah,	4
{D Well, } {D you know, } they tell you that you get tried by a jury of your peers --	24
That's true,	36
It doesn't?	7
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } [ that's when, +  that's when ]  they [ took, +  toured. ]	24
Yeah,	36
You, too.	38
Don't let them watch it.	18
And, you know, I, I believe that if someone goes on welfare that's when, you, you know, send them back to their country.	9
#  ((   ))  # {D you know. }  {C So } it's like, -	26
<Talking>.	20
{C but } ... -	26
Who else is, {F uh, }  {F oh } -	39
That is right.	21
{C And, } {F uh, } our youngest is, {F uh, }  expecting her first baby.	24
Right.	15
# Uh-huh. #	15
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
we really did.	24
Sure.	21
{C but } I'm glad to see us advising them --	24
We're very far from our families,	24
[ [ It, + it's  ] -- + -- it's ] supported with facts though.	9
Yeah,	15
{C but } the nature of the, {F uh, } courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that it's a very long haul before anybody's ever executed.	24
I've always watched it.	25
Yeah.	15
It's just [ a, +  a ] two story building.	24
Not all the citizens and the people in Plano can go ahead and, {F uh, } participate right now,	24
{C so } [ it's, + it's ] fun when we go to that one.	24
Oh.	29
it doesn't look like  it can withstand too much, {D you know. }	24
It's mostly just the tunes.	24
<Laughter> I don't really care for her to be president again.	24
I understand.	21
{C and } all that does  is lawlessness.	9
Yes.	4
I'll never forget.	24
you go ahead.	18
Most of them, {F uh, } continue to work if they [ have, + have ] kids.	9
uh-huh.	36
Yeah,	36
{E I mean, } [ it's still, # + it's still ] a small minority,	9
There've been some interesting subject that  they've called about.	9
{D Well, } I had never been there,	24
{C and } -- -- maybe they're afraid <laughter> that people are going to, complain or something.	9
Yeah.	15
Sounds neat.	21
Yeah,	15
{F Um, } I like it because, {F um, } -	24
On Sunday we just met, uh, a family, -	24
<throat_clearing>  I doubt that that will come to be again,	24
<breathing> it just depends.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } that's got to be paid.	9
yeah	4
Yeah,	15
Yeah.	15
yeah,	36
{C and } within, {F uh, } two months, he has all his house payments gone -- -- everything paid, {D you know, }	24
{C and } they're broken in one way or another.	24
Okay	15
Right.	15
{F Huh, }  that, # is # good then.	21
Bye-bye.	38
Yeah.	15
They could do very well,	9
{C And, } {D you know, }  the second time you see it, you understand more subtleties in it.	9
{C and, }  {F uh } -- -	26
{C but, } {F uh, } {D you know, } there are requirements, and  quotas, what not, for me to make,	24
Where did you all move from?	39
{C but } <laughter>. -	26
That happens.	27
{F Oh, } {D well, } {D see, } {F um, } <laughter>. Uh-huh.	26
we do.	24
{C but } I'm thinking about changing right now <laughter>.	24
Right.	36
She lives with my mother and my father who also live here in town	24
{F Oh } yes.	29
I don't know,	19
{D Well, } I don't know <lipsmack>.	19
Yeah.	15
{C but, }  {F uh, } we're toward the bottom.	24
What's it like to be twenty-three as a woman  today,	39
They used them in Afghanistan, did [ re-, + remarkably ] well considering the terrain they were flying in.	24
[ {C so, } + {C or } ] if my call rate [ of, + of ]  eight [ t-, + ] or so a week went up even higher because <laughter>, {F uh, } someone [ had, + had, ] -	9
{C so, } {F um, } [ if you, + {F um, } unless you ] have some other things you want to talk about as having to do with P C -s. -	8
{F OH, } yeah.	21
That's right.	21
{C but } -- -- what I usually do is I'll try it  out in the magazine first, and, without tearing it out, and then give it a, -	24
Huh.#	15
Yeah,	15
Yeah,	15
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ]  {F uh, } we ended up going to see GREEN CARD.	24
{C and } these people that had changed her diapers when she was three were still there.	24
yeah.	26
# {C But } [ I've, # also, + I've also ] used them [ for  building drawers + [ where you, + ] {F uh, }  for rabbeting ] [ and, + ] {F uh, } because, {F uh, }  rabbeting [ on my table, + on my, {F uh, } radial arm saw ] is a little bit uncertain <laughter>.	24
I would commute every day, {F uh, }	24
{C and then, } {F uh, } after we sold the first house, we were left with enough cash that there  was enough to make the down payment on this house.	24
college is so  casual,	9
Yeah,	15
Just in a very cursory way.	24
{C and } I thought that was a good deal.	9
he didn't go out with the intent of hurting someone else. Or with no regard for someone else's well being.	22
<Laughter>.	20
Have you ever read, {F uh, } or heard of the book THIS PRESENT DARKNESS?	7
{C but } you can get them in the nursery.	24
[ We're, + we're ]  going to one here in a couple of weeks.	24
In  (( Allendale )) .	24
[ Who's, +  who's ] not very well educated?	14
{C So } where do you think they target their efforts?	16
My mother, {F uh, } doesn't  get paid much money,	24
Yeah.	15
No.	33
Steve, {F uh, } with the election year and whatnot coming up, do you think we ought to cut taxes, raise them,	7
{C but } we've had lots of them in the past.	24
that's true.	36
{F Um, } that was a concern with me.	24
{F Uh, } yes.	4
Were you, -	26
Yes,	38
{C But } I thought it was pretty neat.	24
{F Oh, } just about a week.	24
{F Oh, } really?	12
[ That ki-, + the kids ] maybe on the average get, {F uh, } something like thirty seconds of  quality time with the parents.	9
[ {C and } + {C and, } ] -	26
Yes.	36
-- {C and } I've made many trips to  Washington and down to Virginia Beach, Virginia, where my mother lives,  and things like that,	24
-- {C but } it's pretty varied.	24
Yes,	36
society's  not going to put them to death,	9
I'm originally from  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,	24
# No,	36
{C but, } {F uh, } we're to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away -- -- for college,	24
and we're having problems now because the fish are dying and certain acidic loving plants, uh, or alkaline liking plants are j-, not lasting anymore because the soil levels, the p H is changing -- -- as this acid rain continues to fall.	24
you're right,	36
{C and } that's about it.	24
{C and } they're just beautiful.	24
# Right.  #	15
{D You know, } my parents don't hardly use them.	24
What kind of work do you do when you're consulting?	39
[ if he, + if he ]  thinks it's going to be two hours, it's four if, {D you know, } whatever,  it always takes him twice as long.	24
what color [ is, + is ] yours blooming?	39
Of course the ones I always  remember are [ the, +  the ] older ones --	24
{C and, } she's only [ [ about, {F oh, } si-, +  between six and eight, ] +  six to eight ] weeks old	24
we just got married {D like, } {D like } December,	24
They played Dallas.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } knowing how they love to dig -- -- and love the water, {F um, } [ and + ] we thought  that was kind of a tough climate --	24
It's frustrating.	9
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
The same way <static> our people have to go by their laws when they're over there.	9
What are your memories of boating,	39
Yeah.	15
{C but } I think it looks good on taller people.	24
{F Uh, } I like classical music.	24
again, they just were six,	24
Right.	15
{C But } [ I get, + I have ] that problem with [ the + the ] ceiling, {D you know, } [ the, + {F uh, } the ] [ blown, + blown, ] ceiling. {D You know } where you get around the edge.	24
You think my daughter would like it?	7
Yeah,	26
{C but } I didn't get elected on the panel,	24
I really do.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } yeah.	15
Now tell me what you expect from the Mavericks this year.	18
{F Uh, }	26
{C But, } {F uh, } {D no, }	26
Have fun playing tennis.	38
# {F Oh, } it's [ be-, + unbelievable,  ] #	21
Okay.	29
he's in kindergarten,	24
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] the last, {D you know, } -	26
Yeah.	15
{C and } you can go the opposite direction and, {F uh, } over do   all the frills and laces and flounces and  what have you, which don't belong  [ in the, +  [ in, + at least in my opinion, in the  ] ] work place,	9
{C and } they have all the things during the morning,	24
{C but } # is it, # -	26
Yeah,	15
Okay.	29
are you going to be a career person?	7
Ours has too.	24
Do you think [ to + ] possibly [ is + ] that it will help with the regular banks?	7
I don't feel well unless I am exercising	24
[ That, + {F uh, } is that ] Amelia Earhart, [ -hart + ] School there?	7
the cheese fondue I make, -	24
{C but } it's a big commitment.	9
I should imagine Virginia, from what I read, {F uh, } {F uh, } is like  every other state.	9
[ I think that the, + I think what, ] -	9
it's just a problem that [ p-, + ] no one is sure just how to handle -- -- I think.	9
I agree.	36
Uh-huh.	15
I've been listening to that a lot lately.	24
{F Uh, } back to gardening.	24
Yeah.	15
Okay,	15
{D Well, } {F um, } I'm going to listen.	3
I think they have ten in the summer, {D you know, } [ one, + one ] week after the other.	24
[ {C and } a lot of their classes, + from the time they were about third grade, [ they, + they ] changed classes ] several times during the day, which has its pros and cons,	24
Of course, {F uh, } you being from New Mexico, you've probably been [ n-, + ] to Washington. Especially if you're, your present location.	9
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
why not because that's [ a, + a ] lot of  times, {D well, } it's, -	9
{C and } I have, -	24
Nutrisweet,	2
Uh-huh.	15
{C so } I get to see the different ways that they, # {F uh, } all raise # them.	24
Yes.	36
Yeah,	15
They're getting serious about things like, {F uh, } mandatory, -	24
((   )) .	13
[ I, + I ] don't know.	24
{F Uh, } now I like, {F uh, } everything Mi-, {F oh, } -	24
Sure,	15
{F Uh, } we went to Hawaii on our honeymoon,	24
<breathing> They're given  like, a ten year time limit -- -- where, -	9
Yeah.	15
{C And, }  {E I mean, } it just scared me to death	24
I'm sure it's fast  ((   ))  or something.	9
{D You know, } [ it is + {D like } it is ] not going to do that much damage to the course, but apparently they think differently <laughter>.	9
{F Oh, } that's great,	21
I'm surprised you didn't go [ to, + to ] any [ pa-, + parties ] or anything where they were playing a lot of music or stuff	9
{C so } a lot of the, {F uh, } cars go to, {F uh, } {D you know, }  ((   ))  shops,	24
I think that's what it is,	24
no,	32
I guess I never heard the history of that.	24
You should be able to accomplish as much.	9
-- Ryan against Ryan, {F huh. }	7
-- they [ have + can ] look after a lot of things	24
Right.	15
they do <laughter>.	10
<Laughter> Yeah,	15
East Texas is recruiting for, {D you know, } their fall semester	24
it's a good reference when you need to dig something up.	9
# Yeah. #	15
{F Um. }	26
{C and } from there we now recycle glass and newspapers and, {F uh, } aluminum cans and  plastics.	24
{C And then } even my eleven year old boy loves to listen to it.	24
Yeah,	36
In the salt water?	7
{C and } I've made a [ few, + few ] garments.	24
it just seems like the weather around here goes so quickly from being Winter to, {D you know, } muggy, and hot,	24
<Laughter>.	20
since it's tax season, I'm doing a lot of taxes,	24
In fact, we found it easier to divide  the major bills up, {D you know, } cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half,	24
I try to,	24
{C but, } {D you know, } I, that, -	26
# Uh-huh.	15
yeah.	15
Yeah,	15
# {F Oh, } I'm sure it must. #	36
[ that's what, + that's what ] people face with that choice.	24
# {C So, } # {C so } what ended up happening [ was, + [ was a, + was a ] ] shift.	24
Yeah.	15
[ {C And, } + {C and }  ] I have older children too that now are out of high school	24
they're distributing them.	24
<Music> Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{F Uh, } I'm just getting tired of when I do get hung up in traffic, not being able to determine what the problem is [ and, +  and ]  come to some resolution of whether it's better to sit in the traffic light and wait or get off at the next exit and that kind of stuff. Just because I can't see, {D you know, }	24
{C And so } [ I, + {D you know, } <sigh> I ] guess most of the time when I think about somebody going into a nursing home, <swallowing> it's more a case of where they are not able to look after their day-to-day needs.	24
{C So } I'd like to go back, because we had, {D you know, } -	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
What ages are they?	39
I've always, -	26
There was a time, though, in the, {F uh, } middle part of November that got really cool, really, really -- -- unseasonably cool --	9
{D You know, } {C so } [ it's, + it's ]  really kind of a complex problem.	9
{D Well } <noise> they keep you hopping, I'm sure.	9
this is our night out.	25
Yes,	4
Exactly.	36
{C and } [ he's, + [ he, + he  ]  ]  must be [ part, + cross part ] with some kind of desert animal, because he's very long and lanky,	24
{C And } that's probably something [ that, + that ] you could do, {D you know } -- -- family, included.	9
yeah.	15
[ al-, + although ] now, -	26
There's plenty of money in the system,	9
Basically, {F uh, } my husband and myself use the credit cards in regards to major purchases.	24
That [ [ w-, + we ] don't have, + {F uh, } {D well } a lot of states don't have ] capital punishment.	24
{F um, } how do you feel about, {F um, } the way the U S has reacted in the Middle East?	31
{C And } that helped, you think?	7
{C and } that's all it needs versus every day when I lived in the city --	24
time to, {D you know, } start going to bed	24
{F Huh. }	15
I would too.	24
{D Well, } the French went in and tried their old style warfare, and, {F uh, } got soundly thrashed.	24
even if they made that kind of money, there's some countries that have {D like, } fifty percent income tax, {D you know, } that have, socialized medicines and things that, -	24
there we go.	24
Is, {F uh, } traction much of an issue for you up there.	7
<Breathing>.	20
[ We, + we ] try to go so often.	24
{C so } [ that + these ] mentally ill patients could walk into where the other, {F uh, } older people that were in there for reasons of, {F uh, } {D you know } age, {F uh, } -	24
I'm glad it's there, though.	24
I don't know <laughter>.	34
Yes.	15
I would love to live up there.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
We didn't have any -- -- insurance.	24
{C and } if I want a car, -	24
{C but } my oldest [ will be, +  will be ] a sophomore.	24
{C so } they'd already taken it apart.	24
I don't, -	26
Right.	15
[ [ In, + in,  ] + of  ] the defense  ((   )) .	26
Have you ever, -	7
I don't -- -- paint, except I stenciled my wall.	24
{C but, } {D you know, } that whole space issue, I think, is real important.	9
Okay,	15
Carp is usually pretty much fun.	24
{F Um, } our friends in Houston bred the dogs.	24
I do read them.	24
{C But, }  {F um, } [ we, + we're ] on the southwest side of  Houston	24
{C And } offer you, {D you know, } help if you need help.	2
{C but } I guess it's sitting around so  long that it's sort of like our mortgages.	24
Yeah,	15
I like  the group.	24
that's -- -- more related to New Jersey than it is to like Rochester, New York, [ those, + that ] kind of thing.	24
I try to fool everybody # <laughter>. #	24
Yeah.	4
Uh-huh.	15
{C And, } {F uh, } {C then } after that [ I, + I ] went to work.	24
We were laughing,	24
{C And } it is not hard to cook, like some meals are.	9
{C but, } {F uh, } I don't know,	19
{C And } perhaps newspapers do that	9
Yes,	36
I did the dance step when I lived up in -- -- Michigan	24
[ Doesn't it just, + {F uh, } do they ] have to go back and do a whole new trial	7
{D Well, } that's probably the next year's agenda.	9
He picks up a stick and goes # bang. #	24
We waited	24
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C And, } ] yeah,	26
My mother was is was teacher for years and years	24
I agree with you,	36
{C And } second time we went to Munich, Germany and were there a week, and loved <noise> Germany.	24
{C but } then {F um } a friend of mine's a doctor and argues with others that conception is a biblical term.	24
{C So } now they're hitting  (( me up there ))  <laughter> with a finance charge.	24
Oh.	15
In quality, especially now days,  {F uh, } that's almost everything that comes across [ [ the, + the, ] + the ] airways  ((   )) .	24
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Even when I was there, my boys didn't share all that much with me,  and  certainly not to the extent I did with my mother.	24
That's what I want to do.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	36
I belong to [ a, + a ] Boy Scout troop.	24
Vietnam we never did get out, {D you know, } never did get the job done because they were too  (( ham strung )) .	9
they were not on the same, {D you know, } ward,	24
What do you do?	39
Yeah,	36
{D You know, } [ a lot, + a lot ]  of people don't take newspapers at all.	9
# Uh-huh.  #	15
Uh-huh.	4
{C but } it's supposed to be cleared out at least by noon tomorrow	24
{C and } I made the  mistake of dropping out of college to get married.	24
Stupid.	9
I live in Richardson --	24
{D Well, } {F uh, } sometimes it's such a, -	26
I think that's dumb.	25
Right.	15
I guess they don't have it at home,	9
It doesn't make sense.	9
Yeah,	15
{C and } he helped me	24
Yeah.	15
<Breathing> yeah,	15
{C But } [ [ [ whe-, + you, ] + when you, ] + when you ] simply drilling a hole, {E I mean, } a real simple thing, like gee, -	9
I'm probably eventually going to get a three eighty-six.  {F Um. }	24
{C and } the actual play time that there is -- -- is five minutes.	9
at this point our children are grown,	24
I see	15
That's a pretty rough area there, isn't it?	7
{C and, } {F uh, } there is a lot of profit that's coming in	24
<laughter>.	20
I hadn't heard about that.	24
Right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
They all have a pretty good reputation.	24
Yeah,	36
that's exactly, -	36
I  think, {D yeah, }  I have to make these,	24
{C and } I don't know that I'll buy a brand new one again.	24
yeah,	4
I'd like to see it turned back to {D like } the Southwest Conference down here,	24
Okay.	29
<Beep>  Okay, {F um, }	13
Yeah,	36
{C but, }  {F uh. } -	26
[ I, + I ] just wish all kids, if they have to be put in day school, could have that kind of place <lipsmack>.	24
-- it's definitely new frontier stuff.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh } yeah.	38
{C So } the seven of us went on a cruise and then went to Disney together.	24
You were a confidential <noise>  assistant to the, person.	24
Is it?	7
No,	33
{C but } I don't think that society will be  willing to tolerate the current health care crisis for too long.	9
[ [ It, +  {F uh, }   unfortunately I guess for myself it  wasn't, ] +    {F uh, } it was ] purely by my own choice.	24
# Yeah? #	12
{C So, } as I understand it here, if there's anything, they'll call off schools [ and, + and ] close businesses.	24
you kind of wait	9
{C and } it's very expensive.	9
There may be bottles as well, but {D like } beer cans, soda cans and what not	24
{C and, } -	26
Yeah.	15
I'm sure it is, because that's the way that I enjoy this Pontiac that I have.	24
That's something.	21
I have been told that thing is just lovely.	24
{F Oh, } it is.	21
You ever seen anybody kill a chicken?	7
{C but } I have played {D you know } different courses in in the Dallas area.	24
with the economy the way it is, I think crime can't do much but go up.	9
Huh.	15
[ I, + I ] laid off my woods about three years ago	24
{F Uh, } no,	33
<laughter>.	20
He just couldn't stand it that Charlotte was going to die at the end.	24
{C But, } {F uh, } it's, yeah. -	26
Yes.	4
I know, now <laughter>	24
it's in the strip, yeah,	24
Yeah.	15
Right.	15
(( my husband ))  usually, -	26
in college people cannot, I mean, the teachers can't make tests any more,	9
Yeah,	15
Nowadays I don't think I could afford the boat or the time, nor do we live that close to a lake anymore,	24
[ {C and } + -- -- {C and } ] he knows about AIDS,	24
Yeah.	4
that still could add up.	9
Yeah.	15
<Noise>.	20
{F Oh, } Stockton.	24
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] they basically, {F uh, } type out abstracts which are really literally, -	24
<Laughter>.	20
Afternoon, Doug,	6
Right.	15
I'll have to ask her about that. {F Uh, } because we have a delivery guy that comes around, that sells, -	24
{C And, }  [ they, + they, ] have [ a, + [ you, + ] a ] good appetite <laughter>.	9
-- {C and } pretty soon, before you know it, {D you know, } he's run into so many problems,	24
{C and } what he, -	24
Are you on the early retirement?	7
Uh-huh,	15
Uh-huh,	36
<Laughter>.	20
{C and } that really is the nicest thing.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } it's a little ways off in the future --	24
{C And so, } in the long run, if it's really what they want, {D you know, } they are better off.	9
I read that, too.	24
{C But, }  {F uh, } that's the way it is.	9
[ I, + I'm ] sure it would be very stressful	9
{C and } there's so many different problems there.	24
{C so } next thing you know she's teaching in a maximum security prison.	24
Uh-huh.	15
No,	33
Uh-huh.	15
I guess that's why we need to plan  for retirement, so when we do have the free time, we'll have [ the, +  the ]  means to, {F uh, } pursue our dreams.	9
I know what you mean.	21
We've been in the house just the three years.	24
I saw Peter Townsend on T V last night,	24
{F Oh, } okay.	29
I hope you can understand what I s-, # <laughter>. # -	24
no,	27
{D Well } no,	32
# Take #  care.	38
Right.	15
Yes,	36
# {D Well, } {F uh, } {F uh, } [ have you, + have you ] done any jogging?	7
They weigh about anywhere from ten to twenty pounds.	24
[ It's, + I suppose  it ] depends on who you're working for and where at.	9
Yeah	15
you can just go and vote --	24
yeah,	26
{C and } maybe if the world could have given them some type of aid.	9
<Child_talking>.  <<Very faint>>  Uh-huh.	15
Yeah	36
{C And, } [ you, + {D you know, } you ] just do it that way.	24
It's a salt water fish in fresh water, {F uh, } environment.	24
{C and } was it a dolphin or a torpedo.	16
# [  I think, # + I think ]  the, {F uh, } -	9
<static>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
{C and, } [ let's, + {F uh, } let's ]  throw the rascal in jail and stuff.	25
My husband cuts them out --	3
Uh-huh.	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C and, } {F uh, } I decided it is not worth it.	24
He wasn't, # going to, # -	24
{D well, } I did too.	24
# {D well, } I have a daughter that's [ [ in the, + in, ] + # in the ] I B program at Garland.	24
{C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } I still do it once in a while.	24
I told her that's a gift from God	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
[ he-, + he'll  ] be three in August.	24
that was a lot of fun.	24
One is, you often see in the headlines the big numbers.	24
# yeah. #	15
<Laughter> {F Uh, }	15
Uh-huh.	4
{D Well, } -	26
now [ I, + I ] do use gas cards.	24
Let's see what else do  I do. Play golf some,	24
{C and }  let's go out and do things together when I don't  feel like it, {D you know } --	25
{C and } he has three kids.	24
Right.	15
That makes a big difference --	9
{C Or } if they would allow them to,  {F uh, } give broader answers, they, -	9
{F Oh, } yeah,	4
# Yeah.  #	15
{F huh. }	15
{F Uh, } {C and } my kids like [ to, + to ] go play with their friends,	24
[ {C so. } + {F Um, } {C but } ] [ I stood the, + stood the ] injury wrestling,	24
{C and } she may marry somebody	24
{C and so } it's like they charge you for  the deposit,	22
This was a long time ago.	24
That's right.	36
{F Uh, } it has to do with airplanes and everything, which is what his whole life is <laughter>.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Huh-uh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
[ we, + we ] have a few, {F uh, }  of the real short stem.	24
{F Oh, } I -- -- understand.	15
{E I mean, } I, -	26
no.	36
[ [ that's, +  that's ] + [ alwa-, + ]  {D well, } that's ] kind of a hobby	9
[ {C But, } + {F uh, } {C so, } ] do you do, {F uh, } -	7
they have A B C D type tournaments	24
{C but } here there's just no comparison  that, much more crime. -	24
{C so } I would say -- -- in the last three years, we've probably used a lot more cans than ever before.	9
Okay,	15
Uh-huh.	15
nice way to start off this spring. Get back in shape.	9
{C and } my mom grows, -	24
It was so awful.	24
That's right, {D you know, }	11
[ {C but, } + {C but }  ] there are, -	26
If the-, -	26
it's not ours, {D you know. }	25
Yeah,	36
# {C or } # they say they do anyways,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C So, } {F uh, } {D anyway, } {D well, } it's good to hear from you.	38
{C And, } {F uh, } my mother and my older sister  both are geriatric nurses.	24
H M O.	2
{D Well } <breathing>, {F uh, } <breathing> <noise> I'm not sure to be honest with you,	17
{C but } he started [ the + {F um, } {F uh, } the ]  movement for creative nonviolence.	24
Yeah,	15
<Laughter> {C And, }  {F uh, } we, -	26
# I # once too,	24
[ It's a, +  {D like } it's ] something you  either just really want to do it	9
{C so } it ought to just be a ball.	24
{C So, } I have [ little projects + <children> little computer projects ] going on that I consider hobbies.	24
I had not received my, {F uh, } personal identification number.	24
Yeah.	15
{F Uh, } {C so } [ [ we're, +  we're  actually, ] +  we're ] pretty disciplined,	9
It's just now [ st-, + still ] a little overcast,	24
{D Well, } [ how do, make, + how do [ you, + you ] cook ] crawfish?	39
{F Oh, } {D well } that's interesting.	21
you're a house husband	25
{F Oh, } it's {F uh, } scaled back considerably.	34
Yeah,	36
Yes,	36
{D well } up until a few years ago, I guess, there just too many liberals about and  permitting too many, {F oh, } -	9
Yeah.	15
<Laughter> No,	32
{C But } you have to drive that  old car until you get that money saved up for that new van.	9
Really.	12
{F Oh, } {C so } you don't wear heels anymore I'll bet.	22
Yeah.	4
{C So } I'm thinking, {F um } -	26
# Uh-huh.  #	15
{C and } I had to carry a beeper around	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } they're small, [ and, + {F um, } and ] fluffy,	24
[ It, + it ] is convenient, isn't it?	7
-- {C but } any big city has a bad section.	2
Yeah.	15
I like it from a distance really.	24
[ {C and } they  ((   )) , +   {C and } that's ] why they're so  compatible. Because {E I mean } -	24
No.	36
{C and } I tried to talk my husband into just buying a whole bunch of pots <laughter>. And planting them all in it, {D you know, } because that's favorite thing, is tomatoes -- -- to grow.	24
Uh-huh.	15
# Oh. #	15
{D well } I don't know if they consider themselves animals anymore.	24
th-, -	26
{C so } it's lot better.	9
It was same time period,	24
{C And } how did you feel it went?	31
{C and } I just think it's such a hassle,	24
[ it's a, + it's a  ] catalytic converter,	24
[ It, +  it ] really kind of depends [ on, +  on, ] {F um, }  [ what they were, +  {D you know, } what they were ] looking for.	9
Why?	39
{D Well, }	3
# Around a thousand. #	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	4
I think everywhere they just need to sit down and hire some people,  the grunts, as I call them, like  myself <laughter>  -- -- to tell them,	9
{F Uh, } {C but, }  {F uh, } they managed to get through, although not always with flying colors.	24
{D now, } did you push one?	7
Yes.	15
Uh-huh.	15
They, {F uh, } go along and have so many miles I guess of highway to take over --	24
{E I mean, } I don't know,	19
{F Oh, } it's okay.	27
# Uh-huh. #	15
Uh-huh.	15
I go now, with my husband.	24
Whatever he makes, it's all out of the same thing.	24
{C but } [ [ it's, + {D you know, } it, ] + it ] was Lubbock View Christian Church	24
Yeah.	15
Knock on wood <laughter>.	24
It looks like our Cowboys are coming back	9
I'm a student.	24
we just do, {F oh, } tomatoes, bell peppers, radishes and turnips, {E I mean, } not turnips,  carrots, beets and things like  that.	24
I've had real good luck with them.	24
{C but } I know in Colorado I have witnessed that where [ it just, + {F uh, } it just ]  stacks up [ at the + when the ] Rockies starts,	24
<Laughter>.	20
Yeah.	15
[ {C and } then they, + {C and } they, ]  {D you know, } -	26
Hi,	6
Yeah.	15
yes.	4
{C but, } -	26
stay in the house as long as you can.	25
therefore, [ my, + my ] reading pleasures are quite wide.	24
{C and } I looked at him	24
-- {C and then } they have about six miles  from here is called, a little city called Wesley,	24
yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah	15
{C and } nothing wanted to go,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } that's another big factor of mine.	24
[ It was, + it was ] beyond, {F uh, } -	26
<Cough>.	20
I agree with you very much so.	36
What d-, what is that?	39
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } I came out of there	24
we use it live in California	24
luckily I've paid in state tuition the whole time.	24
{C So. } -	26
Right,	15
Sure,	38
{C So } that they have at least one service every Sunday.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } I remember, -	24
{C and, } {F uh } -- -- boy,	26
I don't know	19
{C and } that was the worse car I've ever driven in my life.	24
{F Uh, }	26
{C Because } there's just nothing in there that interests me.	24
that's just part of it.	9
Quite a long time, {F uh, } probably five or six years	24
Yeah,	26
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C But } to be making [ a, + a ]  million dollars a year, that's pretty sad.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } it is tough --	24
an abortion means it's somebody's in trouble and that it's an awful thing, {D you know }	9
I really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis.	24
Okay.	13
Uh-huh.	15
{D so } have you ever voted at all?	7
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } [ they, + {F uh, } {D well, } <breathing> they ]  quit making those, the  (( quieter jet )) carburetor	24
# <Laughter>.  #	20
Uh-huh.	15
{C so } it's not any,  {D you know, } {F uh, } build up on the charge cards at all.	24
Yeah,	26
{C and } it seems a lot of  times [ that, +  {F uh, } especially in criminals that, ] their rights are so protected	9
We, -	26
{C or } my oldest is in school	24
[ {C And, } + {F um, } {C and } ]  that's my favorite way to exercise.	24
from Plattsburgh Air Force Base.	24
I know I have, {F uh, } {F um, } home security system.	24
{C and } [ they just, + they're  ] not meant to last, at all,	9
We've been trying for about two years but -- -- no luck yet.	24
Wow.	21
"{C And } my mom was like, ""They should  just be all shot right now."""	24
I think you are right	36
Okay.	13
I haven't.	24
Right.	15
{C so, } -	26
{C So } she's into this.	24
[ That, + that ] is certainly true.	11
# We lived # -- -- really close to a par three golf course.	24
Yeah.	15
{C but }  I'm,  {D you know, } -	25
just this last summer we went back to Utah,	24
{C And then } the tuition is also the same thing.	24
Yeah,	4
{D Well, } that's really too bad because [ it, + it's ] giving some people unfair advantage.	9
{F Oh, } I see.	29
Uh-huh.	15
I served,	24
Right,	15
{C But, } {F uh, } sometimes if  something, {F uh, } is on that they want to watch I leave it on,	24
I think [ the benef-, + the company benefits ]  in the long run.	9
Kiss some butt,	22
{C And so }  then I would just have messes in the house,	24
That's right,	36
# {C And  # -- -- then } there, [ th-, + ] [ is, + is ] that other group #  that is # -- -- working to maintain a standard of living -- -- that, {F uh, } they think [ is, + is ] surviving <laughter>  which is really more luxuries.	9
{F Oh, } I know.	21
{C But } now I realize that it was  better because, {F um, } they have got into a lot of trouble, because of lack of supervision.	24
do you kind of just, -	26
a lot of them do get their sentences commuted to something else.	9
#t-, d-, whether my dentist or# <laughter>, -	26
We live <noise> out here [ by, + it's by ] Ogden.	24
{D see } [ it makes, + it makes, ] {F uh, } five pie crusts at once.	24
that should be life,	9
{C and, } that way, whatever meat we have, if they don't like it, {D well, } -	24
I don't complain weather wise though, because it was also thirty-five degrees there yesterday morning,	24
Yeah.	15
{C but } it's for, {F um, } -	26
{E I mean, } gee whiz.	21
{E I mean, } I'm just now finally starting to do the aerobics thing.	24
I say down,	24
Do you have a two income family or one income?	7
Yeah.	15
that's right.	36
{C and } we have a bunch of college kids around here going to Tech,	24
-- {C and } they bloom in, {D you know, } late June, mid, July.	24
{C and } they were growing so fast	24
{F Oh, } you're kidding.	21
{D Well, } I do not know.	19
Yeah,	4
# Yeah,	36
{D You know, } why do you do this to yourself?	16
I found that real interesting.	24
Yes.	15
That's okay, too.	9
I hate it for her,	24
They supplied some, {F uh, } {D you know, } -	26
He jumped off the balcony actually,  of a second story apartment.	24
yeah.	4
{C So } Arlington's going to build a stadium, a bigger one.	24
I do too.	24
Do you really think that new vehicles though is a big problem.	7
You're not  (( ridged ))  right?   *[[spelling: rigid]]	7
Okay,	15
I do watch the special shows that they come out with, the NOVA stuff.  [ And, + and, ] the nature shows.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } we use to catch those little bullheads	24
There's supposed to be a storm,	24
I know.	36
<Noise>.	20
# {F Oh, } yeah, #	15
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] in talking with, {F uh, } some of my fellow students,   it looks as though, {F um, } nursing homes are not going to be the only option any  more	24
Yeah,	36
{D Well } the injector nozzle and stuff in, {D you know, } the big diesel farm tractors, {D you know, } {D what } are about the size of your thumb,	24
Right.	15
you're thinking of Rick Moranis.	9
[ it was, + I think it was ] the south east area, from Dallas.	24
They're not even there yet  -- -- {D you know. }	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C But } I normally  get a call {D like } every other day.	24
they had, {F uh, } a murder mystery,	24
{F Um, } one down there is [ the, + {F uh, } I think it's an ]  old schoolhouse.	24
Right.	15
{C and the } <laughter>, -	26
{C So, } we're just  going through the process.	24
he's on national radio.	24
{C But } I haven't really  cared up until this point.	24
Really.	15
Yeah.	15
I, I -	26
-- and it was one of those cash and carry deals.	24
Yep.	15
They had summonsed eight hundred people,	24
{C but, } {F um, } we really would like to,	24
yeah,	15
<Laughter>.	20
))  right <laughter>.	15
I didn't need it.	24
Yes,	15
Uh-huh,	15
{F Huh, } {F oh, } yeah,	36
It, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
No.	36
{C and so }  <laughter> I really don't receive any benefits right now # <laughter>. #	24
{F Oh } yeah.	15
When you say that you grew up, {F uh, } in the sixties I take it that was the, {F uh, } teenage type years	8
right,	36
I mean it's, -	26
Yeah,	36
We always had just one.	24
{D like } they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water, {D you know, } that kind of thing.	24
{F Uh, } not tons,	5
{D So, }  {F uh, } what do you think about it?	31
{C But, }  it, -	26
Yeah,	15
{C or. }   I do not mean [ respons-, + ] attachment and responsibility,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I was curious as to [ w-, + ]  {D you know, } what specific things [ you, + you ]  did have to put down.	24
Okay,	38
<Throat_clearing> <<faint>>.	20
{C but } I think there's enough news out  there that they could pass on more factual information to us,	9
I read [ a, + {F uh, } a  ] novel that used the names of like Princess Di and Prince Phillip coming over here to be entertained and  all,	24
{C And then, } {F oh, } let's see,  there's a couple or three that I would like to go see before they go into videos.	24
which I, -	26
{F Oh, } yeah	15
Yeah	15
That little things like [ that, + that ] -	9
{D Well, } I know that Russia, [ they're, + they're  ] comparably [ more, + better ] educated than we are, in our country.	24
# <Laughter>.  #	20
-- {C and } there's no, -	24
Right.	36
{C And } it still takes me twice as  long as I think it's going to take to do the job,	24
I'll do that.	37
All right.  # Have I got your attention now? #	25
so that your mom doesn't have a job -- -	9
Right.	36
# Is it? #	12
I just really can't disagree with you.	24
Yeah,	15
Yeah.	36
# You might be right. #	21
{C so, } -	26
Yeah,	36
{C And, }  {F uh, } {F uh, } [ he gets, + he sees ] them out running a lot	24
Yeah.	15
{F Um, } [ I think, + I think  ] that idea is [ even, + even  ] more common in Western Europe.	9
yes,	15
Uh-huh.	15
I guess people just kind of keep their noses pointed in their own business,	9
# Uh-huh. #	15
Shoot man, it's, what, midnight almost?	8
Yeah.	15
{D Now } what type of woodworking do you do?	31
{D Well, } [ that sounds interest-, + that sounds fun ] <laughter>.	21
-- and that's an invasion of my privacy, I think.	9
<Music> {D Well, } {F uh } I don't know that we really have a budget.	24
the old church.	2
that's -- -	26
{C and } the second time he never came back.	24
{D So, } do [ you, + your ] privacy being invaded at any time?	7
{C So. } -	26
-- {C and } I have a mini van we bought a few years ago.	24
{C but } they have to adhere to that industry standard.	24
{E I mean, } she's not a gifted pianist in the sense that she's going to excel just naturally.	24
Yeah.	36
Oh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Somewhere in China somewhere I think that it was # filmed. #	24
{C Because, } {F um, } they don't allow me to work since, {F uh, } I'm a foreign student.	24
I wouldn't want to see it cut any more than that.	24
Yeah.	15
I don't know how far they trace.	24
{C And } you think that would be relevant.	2
{C Because } under the law if your child [ mo-, + ] back talks you, # he # would be stoned.	9
[  I, + I ] {D like } keep forgetting to make these calls.	24
Uh-huh.	15
That's -- -- # so important, #	9
I never really thought about that,	24
{F Oh, } {C so } he's really into it.	22
[ {C and } I, + {C and } I ] like it, {D you know, } I don't know.	19
It's a eighty-seven.	11
{C and } they, -	26
{D Well, } good.	21
Really,	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C so } [ we've just, + we've ] kept on --	24
[ I, + # I ] never # really watched the whole thing.	24
{C And } [ y-, + you ] want people out of prison	9
I understand that totally <throat_clearing>.	21
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } then again, she has a lot of support	24
Yeah,	4
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	36
{C and } I thought I would never buy a house -- -- with a flood gauge down the street.	24
Its reliability.	24
Okay.	13
{C But, }  {F uh, } I found the motor boating was real fun.	24
Yeah.	15
a girl would like you to spend time with her going shopping <laughter>.	9
{F Oh, } pardon me,	41
Yeah.	15
Huh-uh.	15
I've never been past Ohio.	24
{C so, } we don't have a yard,	24
Okay <laughter>.	15
{D Now } as far as our grass, it grows crazy <laughter> here.	24
{C And } {D you know } there's not going to be  those adding mistakes that we all make.	9
# That's # considered a pretty good program.	24
They had, {F uh, } -	24
# Oh <laughter>.  #	15
Yeah,	36
{C and } [ some, + something ] has to be done because I definitely think [ [ it's, + it, ] + it ]  really [ plays, + reeks ] havoc with your quality of life when, {D you know, }  you can see it's going on around you	9
Sure.	15
Yeah <noise>.	15
{C because } I remember our family,   {D well, } [ [ we, +  we, ] +  we ] went everywhere.	24
I work during the week all the time.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C but } I just felt like  justice wasn't served because they had the  money, the big lawyers, and she didn't,	9
[ in, + ] {F uh, } -	26
{C and } [ I, + I ] taught school for six years.	24
What have you done?  <noise>.	39
{F Uh, } {C  so } it's like I said spending money doesn't guarantee you, {F uh, } winning a pennant.	9
(( to )) . -	26
{D Well, } I've really enjoyed the conversation.	38
you can make it either tight or <laughter> as loose as loose can get.	24
Oh.	15
{C And } the other is with my whole  family whom we, {F uh, } go somewhere that the kids will enjoy <breathing>.	24
{D So } what is your advice to -- -- picking a college.	39
{D Well, } that doesn't, -	26
# [ [ it, + it, ] + it's ] just not the com-, -	26
{C And } I saw a silver necklace that had these little teeny weeny silver spatulas [[ and, + and, ] + and ] knife [ and, + and ] a fork and all kinds of #stuff# --	24
{C And } if they can't come up with something by the fifteenth, then the state's supposed to decide, the courts.	24
{F Um, } no,	33
<breathing>.	20
-- {C and } they'll fix you. {D You know. }	24
You were good at it <laughter>.	22
# [ it's, + I # notice [ it's  like, + it's like ] ]  THIS OLD HOUSE,	24
Yeah.	15
{C And, } -	26
I don't think we have a adequate policing, uh, particularly on industry.	9
{E I mean } it's just a precaution for everybody.	9
# Uh-huh.  #	15
# Yeah, #	15
I may just be flat painting over it.	9
{C but } I guess Alzheimer's would  come as close as anything,	24
Yeah,	15
{C and } they're both, -	26
Uh-huh <talking>.	15
[ we've + <talking>  we had ] a problem with that.	24
# {C And } that's, # -	26
{C but } they would rather have it private, # {D you # know. }	9
{C and } we have  Russians and Polish.	24
Okay.	15
You never know.	38
[ It's just like, + [ it's, + it's ] just ]  so ironic that this would happen <laughter>	24
{C but } we tried to figure out whether we could put three in because we really need to be able to put at least three in.	24
How will I dust this thing?	16
{C but } [ you, + you ] got the use out of it	9
you look at the note on the page	24
Have more of an active role in taking care of children, more of an active role in taking care of the home.	9
Yeah. #	15
-- {C and } it's kind of nice [ to, + to  ] have that.	9
That was [ a, +  a ] great one.	24
Maybe you could te-, -	26
It's true,	9
that's true.	36
our house isn't the average small one.	24
# It's all tradition.  #	9
Bye-bye.	38
Do you have that there?	7
Uh-huh.	15
I have to ask you,	19
[ I've heard, + {D you know, } I've heard ] a lot of people say, [ it, + ] the short cut on the cooking for lasagna,	24
I wish we'd, -	24
I am.	11
# {C and, } # {F um, } they said that [ [ they, +   they have, ] +  you have ] quite the problem with, {F uh, } the ghettos,	24
Yeah,	15
I don't know the way it vibrates,	9
I get them rarely	24
Yeah.	15
{C and }  I started crocheting a king size  bedspread for a guy that I was dating at the time.	24
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] the younger generation, the next like my cousin's children, I don't know very well, {D you know. }	24
{D well, } [ that's, + that's ] a very different way to do, -	9
{F Oh, }	15
I tell you.	36
Right.	15
basically I work for Honeywell in Minneapolis --	24
-- # {F huh. } #	15
no.	33
Right,	15
# Uh-huh. #	15
<Breathing>  Oh.	15
I see.	15
{C So, } how do you think we can get people to vote?	39
Sure.	15
{C and } he would write C O T.	24
Yeah.	15
[ Sometimes, + {F um, }  usually  ] the reason I will turn it on is to hear the news.	24
and they have to, that kind of job, uh, to go out there and shovel that tar and, and drive those big trucks.	24
then we moved back.	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
for example,  [ I have, +  I'm ] in a chemistry class right now --	24
Yeah.	15
# {D Well } # -- -- {D definitely, } I'm sure, the winters are more mild here.	9
{C Or } do you think the others are pretty much compatible these days?	35
{F Oh, } it's probably, {F uh, } twenty-five by thirty or forty, something like that, that I put in my normal food garden things each year,	24
Okay.	13
Yeah,	36
really proud of him though, the way he's, {D you know. } -	24
Yeah.	36
Do they teach them in school <child_talking> right now where she's at about drugs?	7
{C Plus, } [ [ the, + the, ] + {F uh, } the ] vet sent me a bill for what he did <swallowing>	24
I've only been here eight years,	24
# Is it your parents # or your husband's parents?	7
{E or, } started to say the, {F uh, } -	26
Yeah.	15
I think, {F um, }  people, -	24
{D You know, } {C and, } as I said, it just rained <laughter> every time.	24
-- and people without small children that may have grandchildren, # {D you know } # -- -- still have these guns	9
Right.	15
She's just a lot of company to us.	24
That's true.	36
let's see, {F uh, }	17
{E I mean } now i-, -	26
They are almost [ like, + like ] a big star.	9
{C And, } {F uh, } now he is a conservative,	9
{F Uh, } my family is, {F uh, } {F uh, } real into camping and four wheeling,	24
uh-huh.	15
{C so } I didn't even think of saying Arlington, Texas.	24
Yeah.	15
[ it, + {D you know, } you ] still have [ the, + {F uh, } more ] drug problems and typical, # {F uh, } # small city type problems,	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
{C and } I'm on work study --	24
# Good.	21
-- {C and } whatever you have to put in there [ to get  the, s-, + to take the gaps ] out between the sheets  -- -- and on the ceiling and all that. -	24
Yeah.	15
{E I mean, } you have to get so used to doing it that it's a habit.	9
{C Or } it becomes snack time for various reasons.	24
Yeah,	36
{C And } it worked out really well.	24
{F Um, } yes. That is a good show.	15
{F Oh } yeah,	15
# Boy, # -- -- you and my husband would have a whole lot in common # <laughter>. #	9
{C But, } {F uh, } [ when you're not, + when you're ] a private company, the rules don't always apply.	24
{C and } that's communism,	9
We feel [ that we, + that they  ] should give businesses more incentives to do more recycling and more reduction [ and, + and  ] more reuse and all those things that could be done.	24
{F Huh. }	15
right.	15
[ I, +  I ] seem to remember that, {F uh, } little byline <noise>  on a lot of things I've read.	9
I don't think I would.	9
for instance cans and bottles, they never go away at all.	24
[ I-, +  especially, it's ]  usually for the young children and [ [ the older, + the old people -- ] + -- older old people. ]	24
[ I, +  I ] think, {F uh, } <horn>  [ I don't, + I don't ] even think it ought to be, {F uh, } voluntary,	9
exactly.	36
wow,	21
{D Like } when I walk I'll take along a radio or something	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } I'm very upset that the news media has not identified those deaths -- -- [ and, + and ] pursued it, {D you know, }   because I'm interested in the circumstances surrounding # this thing. #	24
Good.	21
Yeah.	15
{C And } now finally the littlest one is oldest [ to, +  to ]  sit, {D you know, } and watch the pictures instead of <laughter>  grabbing it and trying, # to rip the pages # out.	24
-- {D so } you know all the story and who did what -- -- and when it happened,	24
{C and } [ you, + you ] give them your  speech and maybe a little slide show or  something,	9
what do you like, brookies or, {F uh, } rainbows	7
Overseas, where would you be going?	39
it's a locally owned paper.	24
I think it just builds on the foundation that they've already built.	9
He's got a three eighty-six and  wants to get a four eighty-six. {D You know, } this kind of stuff.	24
-- {C but } you just don't hear people talk about them,	9
{C And } I got off on my rows somehow,	24
<Child_talking>.	20
Yes,	36
{C and, } {F uh, } they're not bad [ as far as a, + {F uh, } {D you know, } as far as a ] local paper goes.	24
Delic-, -	26
{C and } she did very good,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } they didn't just play all day long.  {D You know, }	24
{C and } -- -- that's usually how it's, {F uh, } happened,	9
yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
Okay,	29
{C and } in the last couple of years things have changed dramatically, not only on the political front but also on the economic front, where, {F uh, } couple of years ago [ we had, + ] {F uh, } America was one of the leading powers and one of the strongest nations in the world as far as economics were concerned,	24
It was a hyacinth.	24
Oh.	15
and I have used it once --	24
[ {C but, } + {C but, } ] in urban areas it's, {D you know, } steak places,	26
And I drove that one home,	24
Uh-huh.	15
-- {C but } [ I, + I ] don't really know how  to go about it without having a degree	24
She can't accept that we want # to be the care givers. #	24
{C But, }  {F uh } -- -- # I # never did apply for a Discover card.	24
{C And } the reason being is once I painted,  I don't want to have to go and do it another five or seven years later --	24
{E I mean } if, -	26
{C but } they have a high school group that works in the Appalachia -- -- # area # every year.	24
{C And } it was definitely voluntary, too.	24
[ They have a, + they have a ] similar situation in that a lot of  old guys on the team,	9
You mean the clocks.	22
Yeah.	15
Fernando.	30
Yes,	36
but she just wants to be able to have that freedom.	24
{C so } I guess with respect to the question, -	9
Yeah,	4
Uh-huh.	15
I just think it's just may be a little too easy  {D you know, } to acquire one. # [ On, + on ] a whim of some sort. #	24
Uh-huh.	15
I'm in the South Building.	24
-- {C and } he's cutting it down <laughter>.	24
I usually do a month at a time,	24
and she had, uh, quite a bit of snow on the ground her way.	24
As I understand it, from the Iraqi point of view this current cease fire thing that the U N, {F uh, } had set up, {D you know, } the Iraqis are probably not going to go for at all, unless they're just absolutely forced to.	9
airlines just drive me crazy.	24
that's neat.	21
I can't even really remember.	24
-- # {E I mean, } # {D you know, } {F uh, } it has a lot less fat.	24
as far as, {F uh, } universal health care -- -- {F um, } I guess I'm all for it.	24
that is one solution to it.	9
[ it's got to be, + it's got to be ] horribly tempting for [ those, + those ] peasants.	9
Oh.	15
{C but } I actually was successful for the last two years,	24
Uh-huh.	36
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
really.	15
{C And } we made some really nice Christmas wreaths with, {F uh, } dried red flowers and dried white  flowers and, {F uh, } eucalyptus.	24
If I had any children [ I would, + {F uh, } I ] hope that I'll be in a position to stay home with my child because I'm not real, {F uh, } {F uh, } trusting <laughter>, [ of + a lot of ] people, # {F uh, } especially today.	24
{D You know, } whether that's two -- -- five year terms or whatever.	9
{C So } that's got everybody excited.	9
I was so upset with TEXAS that I haven't gotten into any more of his books because I thought it was just horrible.	9
Uh-huh.	15
I've got a lot of, -	24
they're {D like } lawyers I guess.	24
Paris.	30
That's right.	21
Right.	15
Yeah,	36
[ I think, + I think ]  a lot of, {F uh, } people probably feeling that way,	9
good.	21
We've gone out to, {F um, } {F uh, } a place in western Pennsylvania called Falling Water.	24
not yet.	24
Right now it's just [ a, +  a ] single level rambler.	24
right.	36
Yeah,	36
How'd you get into it?	39
I've been calling a lot of companies.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Are you a native of there?	38
would, -	26
he said what did you get a deal for, Bill.	24
{C but } they [ were so, + seemed, ] cold and impersonal,	9
Nobody's out of a lot  of trouble more than once.	22
# [ I've # -- + -- I've ] lived down here a couple years.	24
{D well, } there was, -	26
{D Well, } [ not, +  not ]    as hard as some places out west because you don't get the, {F uh, } major pollution sources as you do out in Denver with the -- -- # inversion # -- -- and Los Angeles and [ a-, + ] rest of California which is just terrible it sounds.	24
{C but, } {F uh, } {D you know } the cease-fire,	24
{F uh, } I see.	15
{F uh, } # [ my, + my ] wife's mother # is the only grandparent left,	24
uh-huh.	15
{F Um, } factories [ that, + that  ] burn coal as [ a, + an  ] energy source with sulfur and nitrogen contaminants, {D you know, }	9
# Uh-huh. #	15
<Laughter>.	20
<Laughter>.	20
My wife has a Volvo	24
# Yes.	15
<Noise>.	20
#  In fact, my mom drives trucks	24
{C and so } that's, {D you know, } -	26
{C and, } {F um, } they have a calligraphy show,	24
{F Uh, }	26
Uh-huh.	36
they understand the plight of people.	9
I guess [ the, +  the ]  problem with that is there's no true authority in any kind of international verdicts -- -- like, {D you know, } the old day with the rack.	9
{C but } the people that she got -- -- were there because they weren't qualified to do anything else -- -- {D you know. }	24
{F Uh, } there are supposed to be, {F uh, } some people  [ f-, + moving down here from ] Colorado Springs for T I.	24
It's only getting worse exponentially -- -- it seems.	9
{C And, so } that's how I got <meow> involved.	24
I think, I'm glad you mentioned that, because I think I have to, since I don't have the opportunity in the morning I'll probably catch the head lines on  (( T-News )) .	24
<Noise>.	20
{C And } I was a math major, which was a real rarity, among women at that time.	24
{D Well, } I guess, although, [ I, + ] {D well, }  that's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is, because, {F uh, } if that's the case of a tree falling in the  forest	9
{F Uh, } yeah,	4
when you said it was [ quite a, + quite a ] way away, I did not know [ it +  that ] meant you had to drive like an hour	24
{C But } it turned out to be a very cute movie.	24
My goodness.	21
No	36
{F Oh, } really?	12
I just thought they had some, -	9
[ [ I, wo-, +  I, ] +  we're ] certainly in agreement there.	9
[ I, + I ]  remember whenever I was growing up, often times spent with my Dad was, {F oh, } just wonderful, {D you know, } [ go, + go ] hunting, or go to the races, [ or, + or, ] {F oh, } any number of things.	24
I wanted to see that.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
It wouldn't be any kind of [ special, + {F um, } special ] effects type thing.	24
<Breathing> No,	36
# [ It, + it  ] spread out,	2
{C because, } got teams [ like, + like ] Buffalo who [ weren't, + certainly weren't ] a powerhouse, {F uh, } ten years ago.	24
Right.	15
{C and } I thought it was pretty normal,	9
{C and } I think that's right	24
{C And } the kids in this area are very bright. And come from, {D you know, } parents that are professionals or semiprofessionals [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } very interested in their education.	24
yeah.	15
[ they want the, + they want the ] fun part and [ not the, + not the ] work.	24
<Laughter> Yeah,	15
Right,	36
{C and } she'll just sit there and listen <laughter> like  I'm doing something wrong,	24
{D Well, } that's what my husband thinks about my car now, that he's had the Legend --	24
{C and so } it just sort of echoes through the house <laughter>.	24
{C and } -- -- they do have the death penalty.	24
exactly.	36
{C and, }   {F uh, } as manager [ and, + ] {F uh, } they have a very, very poor leave policy	9
How interesting.	21
<laughter>. #	20
Because [ I, + I ] didn't know if that would make a difference -- -- # in how you # felt.	24
They said that every yard has some --	24
Yeah.	15
{F Uh, } catfish, yeah.	24
Yeah,	15
{F Oh, } gosh.	21
{C but } we don't have any place that collects the grocery bags.	24
Yeah.	4
[ it's, + it's ] been, {F uh, } -	26
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
<Noise> <<pause>> I don't know.	34
whether, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
Right, yeah,	36
{F Uh, } it sounds wonderful.	9
{C So, } [ you, + you've ]  only known the dog, [ wh-, + ] how long did you say.	39
{D Well, }  (( there )) -	26
You're kidding?	12
<Laughter>.	20
{C So } we, -	26
right,	15
Right.	15
Yeah.	15
[ They really d-, + they ] have to have,	9
<beep> {D Well, } [ I, + I ] don't think that [ it's, + it's ] wrong for a company to require drug testing for certain types of positions.	24
{C and } I got, {F uh, } caught up with a class I was taking at T I,	24
{C But } I kind of stay with my own subject matter what, {F uh, } pertains to my daily life -- -- at the present time.	24
{C and, } {F uh, } this one guy decided to play, {F uh, } lonesome cowboy or something.	24
and, uh, I think, -	26
[ I don't really, +  I don't, ] -	26
Okay.	13
Have you ever heard about that one?	7
{D Well, } yes,	36
{D You know, } a lot of times [ I'll wa-, + I'll start watching ] a movie	24
{C and, }  {F uh, }  that was even harder -- -- actually.	24
{F Uh, } {D anyway, } [ the, + our ] benefits are pretty good.	9
{F Oh, } exactly.	36
# They really # are.	9
[ They hold it on the week-, +  {E no } they hold it on [ a, + # {C either } a ] # -- -- Saturday or a Sunday, ] # or at # least a day [ when, + when, ] {F uh, } a great number of people are not working.	11
Right.	15
{C and } I think those programs are really good for children.	9
Right.	15
{C But, } I don't know,	19
Yeah.	15
I like to knit.	24
{F Uh, } actually, no,	33
-- {C and so } we have quite a  collection of those,	24
Uh-huh.	15
I worked, -	24
# Do you? #	7
Uh-huh.	15
we're just, -	26
# Yeah, {F uh. } #	4
{F Uh, } that's a good idea.	21
I don't guess I've ever been to anything like that	24
Bye.	38
{C But } [ I, + I ] think, {D you know, } I'm actually at a smaller program,	24
{E I mean } it's dying now,	24
that's true.	21
# {F Oh } [ I, + # {F Oh, } I ] see.	29
# Right. #	15
when it gets way too hot -- -	26
Right.	15
{F Huh. }	15
# How, -	26
{C so, } I don't have  [ any, + any, ] {F uh, } relatives [ that I am, +  {E or, } {E or, } {F uh, } several generations back, that I am ] familiar with their names and how they fit into the family.	24
Use too.	24
There's no official document signed or anything?	8
Yeah,	36
<Throat_clearing>.	20
{F Uh, } no,	33
It's, -	26
you had to, memorize it,	9
The only problem is I just moved to Texas	24
This guy had supposedly, {F uh, }  strangled this woman and stuffed cotton toweling down her throat and up her nose <laughter>.	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	15
{C and, }  {F uh, } we put him in Amrein's Day Care, [ after. + After, ] -	24
{D Well, } that's good.	21
{C And, } {F uh, } it spreads real evenly	24
{F Oh, } I didn't realize that.	24
[ I, + I ] don't believe in, {F uh, } -	24
# {C and } # you realize it's important that, {F uh, } -	9
Yeah,	15
{D now. }  {D Well, } Mark, {F um, } what was that again?	39
{F Oh, } great.	21
# <Laughter> # Yeah,	36
Uh-huh,	15
I don't know too much about it either.	24
-- {C and } it's been out for  a couple of years,	24
I've heard of that.  #	24
Yeah.	15
We've  had it for, {F oh, } about five years.	9
<Breathing> Have you ever been [ to the, + [ to, + to  ] the ] Dallas Symphony?	7
Nice talking to you, Tom.	38
{D Well, } the other thing, of course,  is the fact that they hope, you will not pay your bill at the end of the month, # so that you # would be paying interest.	9
Well, sometimes, strangely enough, one vote has made the difference.	9
Yeah.	15
{F Um, } I guess the last thing I took to anybody to have done was on my wife's car, {F um, } when we went in for inspection.	24
#  ((   ))  # --     *[[slash error]] -- {D like } the small corporation that I work for.  There's no pension plan --	13
# Yeah. #	15
{C and so, } {D you know, } those don't take much time at all.	24
-- {D so, } -	26
{D see, } [ we never, + in fact I never ]  had squash growing up.	24
Uh-huh.	15
of dang, -	21
{C But, } -	26
we, {F uh, } -	26
[ The, + {D well, } as it is now, the ] middle and upper classes are paying more than their share for the health care of the whole country because they're the only people that can afford health insurance <whistling>	9
I know my brother's home has been flooded a couple of times, {F uh, }	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	36
uh-huh.	15
my truck's broken down	36
I don't know what's the best way to do it,	24
{F Oh, } I did fish out of it occasionally,	24
Yeah.	15
you're like, {F oh, } no,	24
{C and, } -	26
{C And } I've never been sorry,	24
Absolutely,	36
Uh-huh.	15
Okay,	29
right.#	15
Uh-huh.	15
-- {C so, }  {E I mean, } a lot of people, {D you know, } right at the vending machines, # they # have receptacles that, {D you know, } # you # can just pop your cans in	24
Right.	15
Rewrite the whole thing.	2
DEAD ZONE.	24
Huh-uh.	15
{C and } it's really cold and drizzly	24
{C And } {F uh, } that's about it.	24
twenty thousand,	30
I only skied once my whole life <laughter>.	24
Okay.	29
{D Well, } [ I, + personally, {F uh, }  {D you know, } {F uh, } I ] just went in limbo.	24
That's good.	21
Yeah,	15
He is working on his Master's.	24
I've known Jack for a long time,	24
{C So } the type of vacation you'd like, {F um, } -	26
I don't know,	19
{C and } I do not watch a lot of television	24
very much.	24
Yeah	15
It wasn't, # -	26
{E I mean, } {D you know, } {C and, } {F um, } [ I, + I ] know [ where, + {D you know, } where ] a couple of the mills that have, -	24
My daughter is, {F uh, } {F uh, } doing a schedule of, {F uh, }  twenty-four hours on the weekend,	24
{F Um, } we really enjoyed, {F um, } DEAD POETS' SOCIETY.	24
{E I mean, } there's a great deal of sacrifice that has to be made on the part of a family [ if the, + if the  ] wife is going to actually be a mother.	9
We'd stop when we wanted to, that kind of stuff.	24
-- {C and } we can't because it's not accustomed to being on a leash --	24
Yeah.	15
Right,	15
Yeah.	15
Huh-uh.	15
-- {F uh, } which has recipes which allegedly can all be prepared in thirty minutes, {D you know, } the whole meal -- -	24
Uh-huh.	15
Right.	15
I'd like to see the  Vikings get revamped somehow.	24
there's not going to be any room, shortly.	9
We're trying to cut cost and everything like that, [ and, + and ] recycle and  all that stuff	25
{C and, } {D you know, } various people in the  communities want us to play for things,	24
{D Well } they're having  a lot of recruiting this week in all the different areas.	24
Uh-huh,	15
{F Um, } {D you know, } lot of the big name brand, I guess, {F uh, } chains --	24
{C But, } {F um, } I think they took the dental  away now.	24
Where do you take your cans?	39
((   ))  because they have got [ a  good rate on, +  {D you know, } good prices ] and  everything.	24
{C and } my grandparents have a pool	24
Isn't that neat.	21
{C and } nothing happens.	9
I think, -	26
Uh-huh <noise>.	15
[ {C but } it # -- + -- {C but } it  ] does seem [ there, + that there  ] is a lot more here in Plano of, {F uh, } just bored teenagers <laughter>.	9
{C and } they're not really even participating.	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
{C And } talk,	2
Thank you.	42
{C but, } you know how it is  ((   )) .	9
{C and, }  {F uh, } it's hard to tell what I'm doing,	24
{C but } maybe that's what rounds it,  {A I don't know. } {C But, }  tumbling.	9
[ {C So, } + {C so } ] I see us in [ a kind, +  somewhat of a ] catch twenty-two [ unless we, + unless the ]  banks or industry  and [ or + ] the government go together [ and, + and ]  come up with a way to, {F uh, } have us as a part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into the new nonpolluting, {F uh, } compound.	9
I sure wouldn't turn my back on them.	24
at what time,	1
[ Though + ]  [ I tend to be, + we tend to be  ] skeptical.	9
[ {C and, } +  {C and } ] my wife's always worked.	24
It's a  ((   ))  call.	9
The Cocker Spaniels are loud <laughter>.	9
{D Well, } I was going to talk to you about that eighty-six team <laughter>.	24
We could use a little more rain, I believe.	24
It was always my impression that the Justice himself, or herself, had the final say.	24
I'm in Plano just, {D you know, } north of where you live.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C Because } {F uh, } inside  the jail [ there, +  I don't think there's ] no real rehabilitation.	9
{C And } it's mainly Black [ [ and, + and, ] + and ] Hispanic.	9
{F Oh, } you're lucky then	9
it's true.	21
For sitting on there kiesters.	24
It's -- -- supposedly low lift lines.	24
[ If they, + if they ] had it, I don't even know that I'd probably read it even if it was at the library though.	24
that is, -	26
# Yeah,	15
# {F Oh, } that's great. #	21
What is the nature of your company's business?	39
{D Now, } {D see, } [ that's a, +  {A you talk about, } that's a ] crime right there.	9
Anything political?	8
{C and } I said, {D Gee whiz, } for twenty dollars we can go down the road and  get [ a, + a ] motel -- -- which we did,	24
{C And } I know, that, {F um, } I've covered for people that came in drunk, {D you know, } on the late shift or something,	24
[ I, + I, ] {D you know, } -	26
{C and, } -	26
{C But, } {D anyhow, } {F uh, } {D now, } are you going to buy this next car	7
{C So, } how do you feel about guns?	31
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] there's no way   that you can get them, unless it's by force.	9
{F Uh, }  {C but, }  {F uh, } the planning of them -	26
Yeah.	15
once I found out that that's really not necessary or legal then I just refuse	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Alabama.	2
and -- -	26
Huh-uh.	15
{C  so } I'm really just starting to get involved [ in, +  {F uh, } in ]  what's out there and how they do things.	24
{F Um, } {C because } of having, {D you know, } flexible higher education provides a flexible schedule.	24
We really have to do more,	9
there's no where you can miss.	24
how about you?	31
I just thought of that one [ when, + when ]  they brought up about politics.	24
<Laughter>.	20
{C But } there is a grass that you can use that is  shade tolerant,	24
Bye-bye.	38
I think what needs to be done is they  need to control their spending habits.	9
{D Well, } I used to think that universal health insurance was probably the right thing to do.	9
{C so, }  {F uh, } {D you know, }  [ I, + I'm ] ready to get ahold of another one that I can have a little more input into <laughter>	24
[ Which +  [ that's, + that's ] ]  what recycling at home sorting does, {D you know. }	9
{C But, }  you're right, {D you know. }	36
That's right.	36
{F Oh, } yeah,	15
{C And } I think that's the reason it's so high everywhere.	9
Yeah.	15
I think that -	9
Yeah.	15
{C and } he just pulled this thing kind of out of his pocket and just, {D you know, } scanned it,	24
{C and } you don't know what you to want to, put up there,	9
{D Well, } that's true,	21
Uh-huh.	15
You got lucky you didn't ruin the whole engine though.	9
Yeah.	15
{C and, } -	26
Cuomo I believe is, -	24
{C and, } {F uh, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{C But } I know, for a fact that the paper, {F uh, }  on that end they're not, <laughter> {D you know. }	24
{D Well, } I'm relatively fortunate about that.	24
Uh-huh.	15
No,	15
There, -	26
That's it <laughter>.	24
That's kind of ironic,  because I don't live too far from Oklahoma either.	24
It's fun <<very faintly>>.	24
Sure.	15
no	33
{C because } [ we're so, + we love ]  our freedom -- -- and our freedom of choice -- -- and, {F um, } having people <<rattling like  ice>>.	9
I really, -	26
{C But } anyway,  they're trying to [ keep him, + {D you know, } keep him, ]  {F uh, } from reinjuring anything,  but anyway <laughter>.	24
[ do, + do  ] you have a home, or apartment?	7
{C so } I should keep up.	24
Yeah,	36
<breathing> <<heavily>>.	20
<Noise> <<like glass with ice>>.	20
if we were going to support this smaller country, then we are going to support it a hundred percent.	25
{C And } in stores [ and so -- + -- # and so ] forth # it's,  wh-, -	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ I saved pa-, + {D you know, } I recycle paper, ]	24
Right,	15
{D Well, } yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } they said, {D well, } {D you know, } [ [ he, + they're, ] + he ] has no job,	24
{C So } the humidity is I think what does it <laughter>.	9
<Hum> <noise> <<TV or radio heard faintly in background.>>  Okay.	13
Uh-huh.	15
{C But } I'm not sure it's something you can teach.	9
there needs to be a time of inspection and check out.	9
{F Uh, } so, that was -- -- pretty much, {F uh. } -	26
Really?	12
{D So, } -	26
[ We, + we ]  were from North Carolina	24
I went to visit my daughter in Florida --	24
Pardon?	14
Just kind of,   -	26
{C and } I was having my hair cut --	24
{C and } we have this God awful ugly # thing.	24
{C and, }  {F um, } it had been recommended by some friends of ours	24
If they want to, right.	2
Really?	12
about, {F uh, } like you say, using them, yo-, -	9
How # do you blow yours up?	39
No.	30
# {D Like } # one of the guys I work with really laughs when he looks at Minneapolis because he's from Detroit --	24
That's true, <laughter>	36
[ I don't, + I think ]  that's stupidity on parents' part.	9
{F Oh, } do you watch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE?	7
[ they're +  they're ] a set of twins, {F um, } a boy and a girl.	24
# {C So } that's good. #	9
{D Well, } {D well }  I've enjoyed talking to you.	38
{C And } they may be ambulatory,	24
{C and, } {F uh, } we visit Mexico occasionally,	24
that's the only time I ever spent with my mother,	24
Oh.	15
you too Ellen.	38
{C and then } they throw it  out, and get something else, {D you know, }	24
What about people from, {F um, }  Pennsylvania.	31
{C but } [ they're, + they're ] supposed to initiate that [ some-, + sometime ] in the next couple of months.	24
my husband and I lived up in Washington State for awhile --	24
Oh.	15
<noise>.	20
uh-huh,	33
<Sniffing>.	20
{C And } [ it's, + it's ] been real interesting,  the different personalities <laughter>. That I run across.	24
{F Oh } good.	21
{F Oh, } no.	21
{C and } save specialization, I guess, for graduate school, unless they're sure [ they want, + early on they want ] to do something like engineering or something.	9
Okay.	15
{D Well } I B M # doesn't fire anybody. #	24
out of a piece of paper, they can kill somebody, {D you know. }	24
{C and } you have to make that decision	9
<<Very faint>>  Uh-huh.	15
Okay,	38
{C Because } I don't see that really yet in positions of power, really.	9
{F Um, } <laughter> the temptation's too great.	9
{C But, } {F uh, } <throat_clearing>.  Let's see, what else was I going to say here.	1
What's the name of that company <laughter>?	39
{C and, }  {F uh, } -	26
{C but, } -	26
yeah.	15
{C But. } -	26
no	36
Yeah,	36
{C Because } I thought all these people  are going to laugh at me because I don't know how to work this machine.	24
For the last many years I've more or less let them direct what I want to do, # and # where I want to go. And just kind of go with the punches.	24
I'm trying to get my career going.	24
it really is.	21
they're pretty balanced out all the way through.	24
It sure is.	36
{C So } to me if somebody has life, {D you know, } beyond a reasonable doubt [ they should, + that should ] be it.	9
# Yeah. #	15
Yeah.	36
No,	33
-- {C and } he's going through a stage right now where he's kind of afraid of dogs barking if he can -- -- hear them and can't see them --	24
I'm calling from, {F uh, } Provo, Utah,	24
Uh-huh.	15
we pretty much work from project to project [ on, + {D well, } {D you know, } with ]  different sponsors.	24
{C but, } {F uh, } I appreciate that,	24
yeah.	15
{C so } [ we, +   {F uh, } we ] look at the paper,	24
That's right.	36
Uh-huh.	15
it was just, [ one, + ] the little bathroom, were the thing that really bothered me because I felt real closed in.	24
Uh-huh <noise>.	15
when I bought this several years ago when our local economy was good everyone said, no, no, you're crazy to buy a mobile home.	24
Yeah.	15
# Yeah.	15
{C And, }  {F uh, } [ [ it, + it, ] + it ] bites us over and over	9
I haven't seen the ELECTRIC COMPANY in a long time.	24
{C and } now [ I, +  [ lik-, + like ] a said, I've ] read a lot of [ self, + self ] help books.	24
Yeah.	15
uh-huh.	36
# He's been through obedience school. #	24
-- and, uh, there's walking trails on both sides, a walking path,	24
{C and } I don't know if it will ever happen again	9
This is something that ought to be in the schools -- -- # rather than # some of the other stuff they # do. #	9
Yeah,	15
I think [ that, + {F uh, } {D you know, } that ] there needs to be a way that, {D you know, } once someone <inhaling> has gone through, <sigh> {D you know, }  a trial, I do not know how to fix it.	9
{C And } I went the next morning to Arlington,	24
{E I mean, } we just really, -	26
{C And } I, -	26
{D Now, } how many could you serve?	39
{F Uh, } very moving, too.	24
get the kids -- -- interested in it too.	9
That's what it takes,	21
it's beautiful,	24
# <Laughter>. #	20
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
we just put our goals in different, {D you know, }  levels is	9
we do some of that,	24
It's a little bit strange for me.	9
{C But } I think that soon the paper may be kind of the only source again.	9
I think that's why they call me because they want to get people outside the state, {D you know. }	38
{C So } I decided to do it <laughter>.	24
{D well, } she's usually in bed by this time,	24
{C but } I haven't really had a chance to talk to her about that for a while.	24
mostly I do like you do,  give it away as gifts.	24
nice talking to you, too.	38
{C and } your wife's folks still live in Colorado?	8
# It's, {F uh, } # not that expensive.	24
{C And } those people, they're so sweet [ and, + # and ] # so genuine, {D You know, }	24
{C But, } {F uh, } Kauai,	24
I've met him several times.  {F Uh, }	24
{C and  then } on some little technicality they get out and on the streets again doing the same they did before.	9
{C but, } -	26
My wife is sort of in the real world,	24
if you're on a trip or something, you don't have to take a whole bunch of,  {D you know, } cash with  you,	24
No.	36
you have to keep up with them.	9
they've got, {F uh, } I guess all, -	26
Uh-huh.	4
I'll bet you really are.	21
{D you know, } improved. -	26
I'm in a P H D program right now.	24
{F Oh, } yeah,	4
-- that's causing the hole in the ozone.	24
Uh-huh,	15
# <Cough>.  #	20
I don't think they're going to  go to a gun store or pawn shop and get it the right way when  there's a check,	9
I agree with that.	24
{F Oh, } {D so } what would be [ the, + ]  your favorite meal to cook?	39
{C or, } -	7
{C So, } we went all interstate.	24
[ he'll, + he'll ]  take them out just to be with them.	24
<noise> somebody brings a whole lot of ice for  the watermelon	24
{F Oh, } yeah,	36
{D Well, } maybe they don't.	36
you don't get away with this nonsense <laughter>.	25
[ It just, + {F uh, } I'm just ]  not, -	26
{C and, }  {F um, } this woman just offered  (( it to me )) while I was  [ in, + in ] graduate school	24
I drive an hour each way to work	24
Yes.	36
It's on.	24
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F um, } there's a big controversy whether they should have to, {F um, } have [ [ a, + a l-, ] + a ] law to have them certified [ or, + or ] not.	24
{D like, } {D you know, }  when I actually started working full time, [ and + ] [ I, +  I ] got married shortly after  getting out of high school.	24
you remember when Archie Manning was a quarterback?	7
I'm still a full size person,	24
<laughter> {C but, } <laughter> here we go	18
Huh.	15
{C and } they're [ almo-, + almost ] starting to age a little bit here,	24
Yeah,	38
{F Um, } I don't have a whole lot of dislikes.	24
Oh.	15
you got to take them for walks	9
I do.	36
{C But } Tyler, we sort of got spoiled with, I think.	24
# Really <laughter>. #	15
I think, -	26
{F Um, } a lot, -	26
((   ))  I think they could.	9
{F Oh, } I didn't know that.	24
{D Well, } <inhaling> I am not sure.	24
Right.	15
Yeah,	36
{F Uh, } got, -	26
{F Oh, } dear,	21
Yeah.	15
it wasn't so he-, -	22
{C So, } yeah,	15
{D Well, } they had the, -	26
It just seems like  I was so busy all the time,	24
Oh.	15
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Is that usually what you tell them in the letter?	7
it is my favorite.	24
<noise> That's a, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{D Well, } we're leaving tomorrow	24
[ when, + {F uh, } when ]  Dan went up to college up at  (( Ricksun )) , Idaho he took him with him,	24
{C and } I keep saying my check does less and less	24
{C but } I wanted to be sure.	24
Uh-huh.	15
He doesn't really pay attention.	24
To, {F uh, } -	26
No,	36
# Uh-huh. #	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and then } it was time for them to go to bed.	24
{C and } we had mostly mutts,	24
-- {C and, }  {F uh, } the churches always have I think, [ a, + a ] pretty good program,	9
{C and } boy,  [ they, + they'd ] show up.	24
{C but, }  {F uh, } do you see any way of like altering it so that they would become more honest?	7
{C So, }  he's going to probably, hopefully set it up so that he will be able to pay someone to come in and stay with him probably for sixteen hours a day, because I think that's the best situation, is when [ you're, + you ] get that old and you've been independent your whole life, you don't want to go into a home, because, like I say, my father's eighty,	24
I don't remember that feeling back in Vietnam.	24
{C and } when I painted them, I didn't realize that we didn't have any turpentine or paint thinner or anything in the house.	24
{C and, } {F uh, } that was, {F uh, } -	26
{F Uh, } like on Thursday nights at nine o'clock when I get home from aerobics I will watch, {F uh, } KNOTS LANDING <laughter>.	24
Yeah.	4
I was born in Buffalo	24
right.	36
{D actually, } I can't remember,	24
I think what they need to do is, they need to somehow <lipsmack> take the money out of it.	9
-- (( )).	20
{F oh, } gosh.	21
<Laughter>  Okay.	29
{F Um, } let's see,	17
{C so. } -	26
<laughter>.	20
Yeah.	15
thanks a lot.	36
[ that it, + that it, ] -	26
[ we, + {F uh, } we've ]  got, {D you know, } -	24
If she sat down and looked at it she'd be like,  God, what am I doing this for, {D you know. }	9
That's pretty good.	21
on the other hand, {D you know, }  given that my wife likes those, [ [ I, + I, ] + {D say, } I ] occasionally like to watch them	24
{F Um, } probably, {F oh, }	11
Uh-huh,	15
{C but } in reality I think [ they're, + they're ] trying to represent their constituents.	9
I make a lot of afghans or used to make a lot of them.	24
uh-huh. #	15
Right,	21
What are your favorite television shows?	39
{D So } that should help.	9
I just know that,  {F um, } acid rain apparently is a big problem in Canada from,   [ (( would )) + ] -	24
{C And } you?	7
{C but, } {F uh, } -	26
{C and } our Disney was extended a day,	24
{F Uh, } I currently have an eighty-seven, five liter Mustang G T -- -- that I've done a bunch of modifications  [ to, +  to ] make it, {F uh, } handle and  perform better,	24
I'll have to tune in.	24
Yeah,	36
[ I like, + {D well } I like ]  to cook foods I like to eat.	24
{C And } I got to looking at my class of sixty-nine,	24
They're not a cowboy boot,	24
Even with the gasoline tax.	9
{F Um, } basically, the whole, -	11
{C or } maybe it was on the radi-, -	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	15
Uh-huh.	15
I just don't know if, {D you know, }   I was eighteen or whatever, I'd want to be stuck doing it for a year or whatever.	24
[ What, + what ] do you have? Five and four.	31
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } [ [ i-, + it, ] + it ] just isn't chance taking enough for me.	24
<TV> Uh-huh,	36
Do any of [ your, + you, ] in your group get paid for any of this?	7
it's kind of been [ sc-, + ] cloudy every day,	24
I thought so too,	36
{C And so } it seems like there's, {D you know, } always some body digging things like that.	9
{F Oh, } did it attack the child, then?	7
# {C And, } # {F uh, } [ it was, + it was ] pretty wild.	24
Yes.	15
{F Uh, }	15
{C and } they've just  raised the, {F um, } income caps on Social Security to the point where <laughter> -- -- [ you have to be pretty, + you have to be pretty ] well off  before you stop [ paying -- + -- paying ] that as well.	24
Yeah,	15
{C but } they're a lot more trouble than cats actually.	9
<Laughter>.	20
{F Uh, } has Jeff Bridges [ and, + and, ]  {F uh, } <lipsmack> Robin Williams.	24
That's right.	36
{D Well } what have you seen?	39
{C So } I am, -	26
[ [ [ It, + it, ] + that's, ] + that's  ] a possibility.	9
{F Uh, } they may just go into being a doctor just clearly just to be a doctor for the full reason,	24
{C so } I've never been around children.	24
We're just [ not willing to set + a society not willing to spend  ] the time or  the money to do what it takes,	9
Yes.	15
{C Or } we play games, like board games.	24
That's true.	36
-- {F oh } this person had mental problems --	24
{C And } they have just done as much as they  can for that man,	9
Oh, well that's nice.	21
[ {C and, } + {F um, } {C and } ]  I did that when I went to Europe one summer.	24
{D Well, } it's, in terms of guaranteed return on investment -	26
The university?	8
Yeah.	26
Monday night's pretty good with MURPHY BROWN -- -- and DESIGNING WOMEN.	9
{C And so } that was a real  challenge,	24
Yeah,	15
{C But, } {D you know, } I know, -	26
Right,	15
[ What, +  {D now } what's ] ten percent,  we can deduct,	14
{F Uh, } I know it did it all February.	24
Do you have any pets?	7
Oh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
# Yeah. #	15
{C And, } {D you know, } when you work  nine to five, or eight to five, and you're in rush hour traffic to and from work, unfortunately.	24
{C and, } in fact, [ he, + ]   everyone there was a toxicologist for the Environmental Protection Agency, who did work back in nineteen eighty-six, who wrote a letter to Dr. Price in nineteen eighty-seven.  {C And } in this letter he praised Dr. Price for the work he did back in the sixties on this and said that E P A had been doing experiments on nonhuman primates and proving that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis.	24
Yeah.	15
that's the way it was, I'm sure back then.	9
Right.	15
((Though))  <laughter>  -- -- that's about, five percent right there	24
Uh-huh.	15
I'm [ relativ-, + relatively ] familiar with Texas school system	24
You can save a lot of money, too. Certainly cut down on long distance charges [ if you, + if that's what you ] have in mind.	9
The people just don't care about, # what # they're doing.	9
that's basically Eastern European Jewish food.	24
Right.	15
Yes.	4
used to be  [ we, +  we ] put all of our trash in green bags and the trash men came out twice a week and picked up.	24
{F Um, } my most recent, {F um, } movie [ that I, +  that I ] liked a lot,  not my most recent movie, was HENRY THE FIFTH.	24
He likes to dig around a little bit.	24
No, <laughter>	36
# <Throat_clearing>. #	20
I really need to go see the original one,	24
{C But } you got to think in a way it's kind of a outward showing of that they don't think they have a chance of doing anything, and take it out on the school.	9
{D Well } that certainly doesn't help matters any.	9
Okay.	36
I do too.	24
{E I mean, } that's what it boils down to, is [ people like to, + people say, ] {F Oh, } I don't want to be on jury, {D you know, }	24
I can, -	26
Right.	15
{C and } [ you don't want them to have, + you don't want ] a judge to be appointed because you don't want someone's friend to be a judge.	9
-- uh-huh.	4
{C but }  some of the vans now have driver side air bags. Which I think is a good idea.	24
Jack.	24
# Yeah.  #	15
I know.	36
{C and } they have, {F uh, } a couple of shows called basic training,	24
I don't know.	24
{D Well, } {F um, } I'm, {F uh, } pretty pro gun control over all.	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } I enjoy that too.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	36
course in our particular state, {F uh, } we have the prison overcrowding, whatever,	24
{C And } they said that in Canada, there were as many heart, {F uh, }  trauma centers as there is in San Francisco.	24
Uh-huh,	15
{F Oh, } yeah.	4
Uh-huh.	15
{D You know, } it finally got to a  point where she just had to sell it and  move into an apartment.	24
True.	21
# Probably # more tuned in to that.	9
{F Oh, } [ we always -- + -- we always ] do though.	24
Take everybody,	2
the price of home, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
Nice and quiet,	24
Course they pay them,	24
there's no [ t-, + basements ] down here	24
Yeah.	26
That's really wild.	21
# Yeah. #	15
No,	33
{C but } [ I, + I ] like to wear comfortable things like cotton and baggy things and. -	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } they no longer have any other cats.	24
{C and } I'm sure they have some of that now,	24
{C and } they started having extractions at age eight, {F uh, } because they just had too  many teeth for their size mouth.	24
{C but }  [ [ it, + it ] +  to me it ] seems really interesting that they come along and add another ten percent tax, {F uh, }  on top of it.	9
It sounds like just neglect all over.	9
{C But, }  {F oh, } -	26
No,	33
{F Um. }	15
{C and, } {F uh, } [ his, + his ] or her opponent can  say {D well } look, they did this.	24
Right.	36
{E I mean, } [ I'm, + I'm ] thinking of research in that direction rather than -	9
{C and, } {F uh, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
There's no reason that we shouldn't do it,	9
{C and } yeah,	26
{C and } -- -- {D you know, } the [ [ more, + more, ] + less ]  that's done about it the more it seems it tends to spread into smaller areas # unfortunately. #	9
You're going to start getting a lot of gunfire.	9
Well, it, it's, it's a really, day care programs are really neat, you know	9
two years ago we had one,	24
Yeah.	36
They know they're not going to pay it back.	9
Right.	15
Right.	15
you all just had a tornado, {F uh, } over close to Oklahoma and Texas?	7
would you tend to chose the one that does	7
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I've been eating at home all week long with the kids and would like to go out somewhere,	24
{C And } the whole idea was, {F um, } presumably those who get voted in would be wiser than the average person, [ and, + and,  ] a specialist and able to make more informed decisions and can protect against the tyranny of democracy,	24
{C and } [ [ [ the, + the Chin-, ] +  the commu-, ] + the communist Chinese ] didn't like this at all.	24
Uh-huh.	15
and that's also what's causing our atmosphere to lose it's ozone layer.	9
I know, <laughter>.	36
you knew that you were also breathing that into your lungs,	24
I'd rather be able to control my money as much as I do with what's left over -- -- taxes than to live in, {F oh, } England or, {F um, } some countries where so much of it is socialized that you don't see any of that money at all --	24
How's,  {F uh, } -	26
# Uh-huh. #	15
Substitute.	9
Yeah.	15
A certain amount.	24
{C and } I do a lot metacoustic phonetics and -- -- looking at the acoustic characteristics of speech,	24
Uh-huh.	36
Okay.	15
Oh.	26
yeah.	15
{D Well, } that's good.	21
-- [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and }  ] that can vary between colleges, and faculties even, as to [ how, + ] {D you know, } what the attitude towards achievement is.	9
They're just standing  in line, doing whatever they are supposed to,	24
{C and } I think the real trick is to avoid the <sigh>  {D you know, } -	9
# {C but } # I don't know that there's a real, {F uh, } -	24
I think they've gotten to be quite a joke.  The way the people can appeal and  file for mistrials	9
Huh.	15
like [ the, + the ] money laundering scams.  All that was drug related.	9
{F Oh, } uh-huh.	15
{C and } that's what  we're finding, {F um, } here, where we're at, in Minneapolis area,  is that people don't want to carpool -- -- that there are inconveniences to that,	24
they wanted to be like  men,	9
{C And } [ [ [ it's, + {F uh, } {F oh, } it's just, ] +  I don't know, it's, ] + it's ] a total free relaxation.	9
{E I mean } I'm always willing to try anything usually.	24
{C And }  you're going to have to put them in front of the guns just the same.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } when I first heard C N N, it only started about, {F uh, } since the war, {D you know, } or right before that.	24
[ {C so, } + {C so } ] [ the real, + the real ] current news and, the hard news -- -- [ [ is, + is not, ] + there is not ] really enough of it there.	22
I keep not doing it until after I'm there	24
# [ A lot of # gang related, + a lot of murders,  ] {F uh, } just in general the whole, -	24
{F Um. }	26
{C And } it makes them pretty tasty.	24
it is.	36
{C So, } I, -	26
yeah. #	36
{D well, } [ I've, + I have ] had some because I was working for P I E,	24
Yeah,	36
# <Laughter>. #	20
it's been nice talking to you.	38
Good <laughter>.	21
<<pause>> {C And, } entirely too much time is  spent, -	24
Uh-huh,	15
{C So, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
-- {C and } they are so good.	9
Uh-huh.	15
# <Laughter>. # *[[slash error]] # {D Well, } #   *[[slash error]]	20
I don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind <laughter>.	9
# {F Uh, } uh-huh	15
{C But, } {F uh, } I think men and women both have [ valuable, + valuable ] assets to offer --	9
Right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C but, }  yet that can be carried to an extreme, too.	9
{C and } you can't, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
okay.  #	15
We're going to try to make our decision by July.	24
{C and } I have a closet full of sweaters.	24
Yeah.	15
Yeah,	38
{C But } [ I love the food + I love the food, ]	24
I think a lot of it [ was, + was ] just that,  {D you know, } [ [ [ [ becau-, + because  of, ] + of  the, audi-, ] + {D you know, } because, ] + because ]  the majority of the high risk groups were people -- -- no one really cared about.	9
I see [ these, + these, ] {F uh, } supervisors running around, {F uh, } having meetings.	24
{F Oh, } yeah,	4
I hate it, <laughter>.	24
{D Well } [ [ [ that's, + that's,  ] + that,  ] + that's  ] very true,	21
{C or, } -	26
# Right. #	15
Women?	13
Yep.	15
[ I, + I  ] just heard it.	24
[ [ {C And } + {C or, } ] + {F uh, } {C but } ] most the stuff that we barbecue is like steak and chicken and hamburgers, hot dogs, {D you know, }	24
those kind of things age you more.	9
{F oh } yes.	36
{C But } you go ahead now <laughter>.	18
{D Well, } do you have any opinion of potential changes that may occur in the next generation, specifically?	7
{C But, } {F uh, } -	26
{C and } the doctor called me up and said, {F uh, } she had a low white cell count and that, {F uh, } [ she wasn't, + she was ] dying and, {F uh, } suggested that I take her to a [ [ working hos-, + dog hospital, ] + animal hospital ] <swallowing>.	24
[ {C But, } +  {C but } ] that whole, -	26
<Door>.	20
Yeah,	15
{C and } he gets, {F uh, } {D you know, } the full health and dental	24
[ {C and } + -- -- {C and } ] like you said,  [ pro cho-, + pro-choice ] and -- -- whatnot.	9
Right.	15
When they say this proposal, is this something that they're just suggesting,	7
{D well } I don't anymore.	24
{C and } I thought I better do some simple things and  work up to this -- -- because it was just so difficult -- -- to get it done.	24
[ [ I, + my, ] + I ]  guess what I'd have to say about that, is, there can only be one champion <laughter>.	24
one week, <laughter>.	24
{D Well } is there enough money,	24
How about you?	31
{C but, } -	26
although again, we have to prepare the soil.	24
Uh-huh.	15
I think that is what usually people, {F uh } -- -- say they do, [ they + ] like the best.	9
{F uh, } back to the topic,	18
{C And, } {F uh, } the kids like to play Nintendo,	24
{F Oh, } great.	21
Uh-huh.	15
{C so } I tend to read a lot of the baseball books	24
yeah,	26
Especially with the kids.	9
the quick growing,	9
ther-, is supposedly a difference from selling then being a courier	24
I think you're allowed [ so many times, + {F uh, } I think two or three days ] [ a w-, + a year. ]	24
<Swallowing> It was just that when that was empty, you knew you were out of money.	24
{C because, } {F uh, } if you go to the bank and try to get a loan, they want to charge twelve, thirteen percent, {D you know, }	24
they don't even know, {D you know, } what the guys name is, {F uh. }   Bruce Williams who does financial work all over the United States.	24
<Laughter>.	20
Oh.	15
I have a daughter.	24
[ I, +  I ] like  everything basically.	24
{C but, } {D you know, } for other kind of cans, [ just to, + ] it'd probably only take aluminum cans like that, don't they.	7
Uh-huh.	15
# Yeah. #	15
{D Well, } -	26
They run anywhere from  two hundred to four hundred dollars, I think -- -- which I thought was a lot.	24
{F Uh. }	15
what else have I seen.	1
{C so, } # he # and a friend of his get together	24
{F Uh, } I can see [ some, + some ] potential changes that probably [ [ are, + are, ] + would ] not cost very much  but might, {F uh, } make things a little easier. Such as offering [ a, + a ] smorgasbord.   Having a larger variety of benefits	9
I guess the financial planners, the training now.	24
Uh-huh.	15
They won't work.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Oh, really.	15
I think that's really the only fair way to do it.	9
Don't overcook it though.	18
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] times that we do have baby-sitters [ we, + we ] try and catch, {F um, } some things that we normally wouldn't do, {D you know. }	24
Okay,	26
Yeah,	38
I never have much luck with tomatoes.	24
you can prevent yourself from getting junk mail by getting yourself off of mailing lists.	24
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } I imagine.	21
{C so } I don't think I'll have a problem.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Flower beds are all right.	24
Have you seen the show, [ it's, + it's ] new this year, called HOME FRONT?	7
That would be good.	21
I just think they were not doing anymore, {D you know, } than they had to do.	9
I see,	29
yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } {D well, } it sounds like you're pretty much into computers.	9
Yeah,	30
{F Uh, } I have a Ford pickup	24
Oh.	15
<noise> just,  I didn't feel like she was mature enough socially --	24
Liberal politically,	24
He likes to lay next to you  and have you scratch his head [ [ and, + and, ] + and ]  snuggle up to you,	24
{F Uh, } I work part-time	24
{C but } now they're so  much into selling drugs -- -- # and weapons # and all that,	9
it's just # a lot of fun.	24
{C And, } {F uh, } there's a, -	13
Then you were important <laughter>.	2
a long time ago, {A [ I, + I ]  remember my dad was telling me this, }  I think, that, {F uh, } they do it by, like, a bunch of men have guns	24
{C and, }  {F uh, } in order to get Eagle, you have to have merit badges in, {F uh, } citizenship in the community -- -- citizenship in the nation, citizenship in the world	24
{C and } we never did,	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
We had a lot of bank robberies and  [ different, +  lot  of ] break ins and stuff.	24
{C And then } if you want popcorn and stuff -- -- [  it's +  just, {E I mean, } {F uh, } it's incredible. ] No,	24
Right.	36
{C But, } {E I mean, } do you see yourself having thirteen kids -- -- or twelve kids?	7
# {C and } # before even at work, -	26
The # A -s? #	7
[ {C And, } + {C And } ] we often forget about the one the injustice has been done [ to, + ] because I [ bet, + ] they still say our system is the best in the world.	9
I had one kid [ threaten my life, + Threaten my life. ]	24
{D well, } [ they, + they ]  show it,	24
# Oh # .	15
It was quite nice in that respect.	24
We sure need, {F uh, } the business.	9
# I'd # -- -- agree with that.	36
{C And, } # -	26
That meaned she was warned.	9
we lived in the Philippines for T I in eighty-five, eighty-six, and eighty-seven	24
{C and then } it became, {D you know, } an hour and a half, to, {D you know, } some days, two hours to get to work.	24
I think golf, isn't it?	7
[ Ri-, + ] I have some <laughter>.	24
Yes,	4
{E I mean, } you don't have to ... -	26
{F Oh } really, <laughter>	15
# They can't # even afford to take off, {D you know, } to have children it seems like.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C So } he wouldn't have gone to  something like where we're at, [ they'd, + ] in Austin, Texas, University of Texas,	22
{E I mean, } {C and } I just don't think it's healthy	9
[ [ I did, + I, ] + I ended ] up just stenciling [ [ [ a, + {F um, } a blind, ] + {D like } a, ] + just a roller shade. ]	24
{C and, }  {F uh, } as far as I know, it's still there.	24
{C and } some of them are in Turkey -- -- when actually [ [ they, + they don't, ] + they're ] their own people and their beliefs and their own culture system.	24
{F Oh, } I see,	15
Yeah <breathing>.	36
I realize that you indicated you wanted to check out as much as you can about it --	22
Really.	15
{D Well, } I used to make the regular  pudding, the chocolate and put it in the pie shell	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
some people argue that they need a gun to make sure that they aren't going to get shot because of the incidences of break ins and, you know.	9
Yeah.	15
{D You know, } {C and } [ they just, + they just ] wrote it right off.	24
Uh-huh.	15
We drive a lot.	24
It's like  you guys aren't going to get a baseball team, I'm sorry it's not going to happen.	24
they'll help you, recycle, because  [ we, + ] there is some bins, {D like } behind Wal-Mart, that take some things.	2
{C so } -- -	26
Yeah,	15
[ that's, + that's ] good. #	21
Right.	15
{C and, } -	26
to me children, # {D you # know, } need to, -	9
The test is a booger. The test, the exit test.	9
{C and } they're very inquisitive.	24
{C And so } we did that, {F uh, }	24
# Everyone would appeal. #	9
{C And } she got kind of fearful of  being on her own.	24
Uh-huh.	15
# That's okay <laughter>. #	27
Huh-uh.	33
I do not think they are going to because they do no think [ that their, + that anybody ] listens to their vote.	9
<Laughter> That's not too bad.	9
# it's hard for me. #	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
{D Well } that's something [ that, + that's ] worthwhile checking into then. 'Cause I, -	9
# Yeah. #	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and, }  {F uh, }  {C but } [ he will, + {F uh, } he'll ] flip around,	24
They, # were # at the Saudi border. And ready to storm into Saudi.	24
for whatever reason it's, it's actually there.	9
{C And } [ it's, + {D you know, } it's ] interesting  how the votes vary	9
# {C But, }  no	13
<Baby>.	20
Yes,	36
Oh.	15
that's true.	9
{C and } [ I, + I'm ] with you on that.	36
Uh-huh.	15
if you watch the news, [ you're going, + your opinion is going ] to be formed [ about, + ] on what somebody else thought about it -- -- as opposed to actually watching it yourself and forming your own [ pinion, + opinion, ] which I [ haven't, + would ] be much more in favor of forming my own opinion as opposed to following someone else's.	9
{C or } it makes an elegant wedding to # have # -- -- something else.	24
{D well, } I've been over there too.	24
You never know.	9
[ that, + {C and } I know that's ]  a big issue	24
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } I don't know whether we really want to be  tied down to a [ pe-, + ] {D you know, } another dog.	24
Oh.	15
{D well, } the one I was just on,  I don't, -	24
<Laughter>.	20
killing a child, or kidnapping, {F uh, } -	26
Yeah.	15
# No,	33
{C and } {F oh, } it's really good.	24
She's, {F uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, } a poodle.	24
All right.	15
{D so } do you do a lot of cooking in your family?	7
{C so } they did say that you had to  put it out within, I think it was, {F uh, } three weeks after, Christmas.	24
{F Oh, } I don't mind music that's <child_yelling> difficult to listen to,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and }  the backyard has two great big, {F uh, } spruce [ and, + and ] an oak tree all about  forty to fifty foot tall	24
# Uh-huh.  #	15
# Yeah. #	15
{C And, } of course, we had a different coach then, too.	24
Yeah,	15
<Laughter>.   *[[slash error]] Uh-huh.    *[[slash error should be 'b']]	20
{C And } like I said, I think you have to pay for it no matter what you do you with it, because it's industry.	9
With T I, or somebody else?	7
Oh.	15
At least that's for me.	24
Okay.	29
I said, You take that skunk,	24
{D Sure. }	15
{C But } they can't just walk out of prison and do that.	9
{F Oh } no,	21
{C And } do [ they, + they ] have a  hotel,	7
{C And } the question is, [ how much of it + {E or } how, some of it, ] -	16
my mother, {F uh, } -	26
{D Well, } I agree with you there.	9
Oh, well sure <Laughter>.	21
Uh-huh.	15
{E I mean } I can basically leave my front door unlocked and not have to worry about it.	24
It's probably {D like } thirty, forty thousand dollars a day <child_talking> {D you know, } worth of all the free for all.	9
{C and then } you hear the muted trumpet.	24
Another problem is you're going to keep the smarter people in the system too long paying the wages they do.	9
{C and so } [ we, + we ] don't have [ the, + the ] expenses of a building, {D you know } --	24
{C But, } {F uh, } also there's  aspect of cost	9
that, {F uh, } -	26
{C so, } -	26
no,	32
Uh-huh.	15
belie-, -	26
I guess there's so much competition that they, <clicking> really have to be good.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{E I mean, } I am thankful for the, {F uh, } -	24
Bye-bye.	38
I agree with that.	36
I was central California.	5
{C And } that was real nice.  {F Uh, }	9
{C And then, } {D you know, } usually over lunch, there'll be a big topic of conversation on something -- -- from the news.	24
{C and } get used to it from scratch,	9
# [ she, + # {F uh, } she ] had this, {F uh, } book of pictures from it that were really nice, kind of like a travel guide --	24
{D Well, } {F uh, } [ what + <laughter> what ] do you think about the metric system?	31
Right.	15
they don't go  for the food	24
{F Uh, } State of Minnesota.	24
Guess I'm not much of a T V person really.	24
I don't know quite how that works.	24
but you know, it's interesting the two, -	9
Yeah.	15
-- {C and } he's still doing great -- -- still doing excellent.	9
<Laughter>.	20
I said, Yeah.	24
{C And } they had {D like, } -	24
{C And } I know when I spent, -	24
It's I T B S [ {C or, } +  and, ] {F uh, } just [ everything, + # everything. ] #	24
once a year you go out	9
[ we're still, + {D like } I'm still ] covered under my mom and dad's life insurance because I'm still in school,	24
{C and } they'll take a set amount out of each paycheck, {D you know, }	24
{C and } [ they, + they ] just do so many things for you, {D you know, } to make you enjoy the trip and everything.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C so } it's kind of different.	24
Did you know, everybody, or not everybody but  quite a few of the folks were kind of down on Mister Johnson,	24
I like his movies.	24
[ it has the front and the back +  {C and }  {D you know, } it has the -- -- {F uh, } back ] seat let down into  [ a double, +  {E I mean } a queen ] size bed --	24
Yeah,	4
we {D like } pay her for six weeks at a time -- -- cause that is {D like } a unit in, {F uh, } {F uh, } school -- -- {F uh, } report card period	24
[ You can get the, + they have some ] nice camping grounds -- -- {D you know, } that have the water piped out --	9
that sounds really cute.	9
I'm sure it is,	36
I think it's really catching on.	9
{F Oh, } wonderful.	21
{C But, } {F uh, } that gets old too in a very short order,	24
{C And } I think that is happening more and more.	9
Yeah,	15
<Noise> Exactly.	36
{F Uh, } in between the thunder showers,	17
{C So, }  I had to call Jack Godfrey  today to ask him what it was, because [ I, + I ] had to abort the call last evening because  I couldn't get on the line.	24
{C But, } [ I mostly dress, + I try to dress ] nice,  but for convenience, because when the weather's bad, when I go into the home I take off my shoes -- -- <Lipsmack> which I try to wear something easy to take off, {D you know } -- -- and put on.	24
{F Uh, } {C and } we were sequestered	24
{C and } I couldn't think of  anything at all.	24
Uh-huh.	15
Right.	36
Yeah.	15
You'd like to get it from some good cutthroat capitalist <sigh> company but not with <laughter> child care.	9
Uh-huh.	15
-- {F uh, } {C and so } many of them nowadays, like I said, I think are just, {F um } -- -	9
I, {F uh, } never been real thrilled with, {D well, } not, {D you know, } -	24
{C but } I don't believe  in them turning [ a good, + {F uh, } {F uh, } a new ] leaf -- -- unless they have the Lord that  has done that to them.	24
<Laughter>.	20
French horn is absolutely wonderful  instrument.	9
<Laughter>.	20
Yep,	36
{F Uh, } there have been people who have been turned down for jobs because there was a drug showed up [ in their, + in their, ] {F uh, } test,	24
{C and } I feel like, gosh, that's all they do all day long.	24
She loves it	24
{F Uh, } it was about two years ago she got sick on me	24
I can't, {F uh, } -	26
You ever been to Houston's on Belt Line?	7
Yeah.	15
{D Well, } I guess.	38
Uh-huh.	15
there's no hockey, #	24
I don't know if this is part of the topic,	24
I not very long ago worked for Wal-Mart --	24
Uh, some more in-, interest type topics in, in other countries.	24
yes.	36
{C But } when it comes to, {F uh, } sentencing for punishment, of course, if the person's never done anything bad before, according to the judicial system, then they're going to lean towards a slightly more lenient side,	24
{F Oh, } [ I, + I ] don't think Jim Kelly is about to be swayed away from the Bills  any time.	9
Yeah.	15
Sometimes I think we think it is.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C but, }  {F uh, } managed to get him to a veterinarian in time,	24
{C and, } # -	26
{D Well } I don't know any other magazines I could talk to you about.	24
[ it's, + it's ] where Stillwater is or, sweet, -	24
Yeah,	15
{D like } you said, {E I mean, } [ there's, + they might ] be saving money,	9
[ I stay wi-, + I have to stay within ]  it,	24
I tol-, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
Is that, -	26
Most people that I've talked to did stuff like that when they were in college, or, you know, or when they were single anyway.	24
Exactly <noise>.	36
<static> I guess, {F uh, } we keep it all in a safe here at the house.	24
{C And } it's supposed to be very similar to, {F um, } {F uh, } -	24
{C and so } consequently we [ wind up, + wound up ] playing a lot of classical music there	24
Yeah,	15
{C And } your daughter is going to be a sophomore.	22
[ [ [ It's, + it's, ] + it's, ] instead of reporting the news, + it's ] more like an editorial, I believe -- -- on a lot of issues.	24
uh-huh.	36
[ Or, + or  ] Richard Simmons,	24
I really enjoyed it.	24
Yeah,	15
It really sounds like it was fun.	21
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } that is, {F um, } I don't know what section of the public school system they're talking about,  whether it's the first eight grades, the high school, or colleges.	24
{C so, }  we're probably going to {D like } rent those some time and  then try to see GODFATHER PART THREE somewhere.	24
{C but. } -	26
Well what are the others?	31
-- uh, my son over in Shreveport, uh, sold Porsches, Audis, Mad-, Mazdas and Volkswagons for ten years	24
Bye-bye.	38
{C So, } I have a big closet.	24
I think it should be by a jury.	9
{F Um. }	26
Oh.	15
my mom goes camping {D you know. }	24
{F Um } -- -- [ {D well, } I, + {D well, } I ]  am sorry that he has the virus.	24
{F Oh, } always.	36
{C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } something on that level, -	24
I don't like those camping grounds -- -- where, {D you know, } you got R V beside you and then another people in tents beside you.	24
-- {C and, } {F uh, } we've done a lot to take care of it.	9
Oh.	29
{D Like } I know that my washing  machine is going to go any day.	24
{C but } I have had shrimp.	24
{C so, } -	26
{D You know, } I read a study once,	24
We use our credit cards sometimes for a big purchase,	24
[ haven't, haven't ] been to one for a little while,	24
{F Uh, } a lot of people really doesn't think that much about it, because it hasn't happened to them, which it hasn't to me either, {D you know? }	9
{C and then } they all come out.	24
I really do <<faint>>.	9
Bye-bye.	38
which the organization can use the help too.	9
I sent off for stuff on it,	24
{D Well } what are we going to do about it?	16
she was really terrific.	24
Uh-huh.	15
I, {F uh, } -	26
{F Oh, } {F oh } I know who you mean.	24
How about you?	31
they don't have them up there do they?	7
I'm going to start going every night just, {D you know, } -	24
"# {C and } # [ what, + what ] school or schools can  best meet [ those, + those ] needs besides education [ [  yo-, + yo-, ] + you ] can expect all of them  with, {F uh, } [ [ [ a-, + a-, ] +  accreditat-, ] + accreditation ]  to give the education   *[[seems that this should be 2 slash units, the second starting at ""yo-""]]"	24
{C So } I called J C Penney	24
# {C And } # he said that's the only thing that really stinks as far as being retired	24
Do you make sweaters and things or just blankets?	7
{C but } they need the pitching.	9
{C so } I don't take some of,	24
{F Oh, } that's right.	36
Uh-huh.	15
<Laughter>.	20
{C And } it, -	26
[ [ I don't get, + I don't get a lot of, ] + {F uh, } sometimes I don't get ] the current events, {D you know. } Because that show kind of has feature stories that might not <breathing> <throat_clearing> directly deal with, {F uh, } {D you know, } some important issue on the day.	24
yeah.	36
what,	16
[ [ It, + like I said, it's, ] + it's ] an old house and  everything --	24
{D You know, } {C and } I know that one of the day cares {C and } it's [ a, + a ] well-known chain, {F uh, } she was not at all happy with.	24
it's kind of like in Louisiana  where that, {F uh, } guy that's like a Ku Klux Klan -- -- member something got elected.	24
Yeah,	36
{C or } # -- -- a lot of people aren't going to get up, walk out of their offices and go there.	9
Thousands of servicemen, got caught for running a drug ring.	24
{C and } my husband and son go camping -- -- with scouts mostly.	24
Uh-huh.	15
yeah. #	15
{C and } they'll say, -	26
# Uh-huh. #	15
Yeah,	36
Yeah.	15
# {F Oh, } out of thei-, r-, # -	22
{C but } she's still changes her mind two or three times, # before # she figures out what she's going to wear	24
<Laughter> My truck is broken down.	36
{D So, } <lipsmack> {D well, } there's the main things I can think of.	24
{C And } [ these, + these, ] -	26
They like to participate in the profits of the company like they're,  {D you know, } -	9
{C Because } all the problems, -	26
Yeah.	36
Oh.	29
{C and } it would be ideal like [ you, + you ] hope when  you have children, # your # wife gets to stay home,	9
((   )) .	20
that's true,	21
{C and then } you go to read some order book or something	24
I think that we're all paying a little bit too much taxes and not seeing too much good come out of it.	9
Wow <laughter>.	21
{C So, }  to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself without, {D you know, } drawing a lot of looks, means you're really going to do a strenuous workout activity  ((   ))	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
I would try that.	37
{C but, }  I expected more, I think.	24
{C And } I realize that.	24
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } I agree.	36
{C so } you guys can actually get ahead <laughter>.	8
{D Huh. }	15
{D well, } [ I'm a, + I'm a ] Democrat	24
I, worked about fifty-one hours a week,  because I [ worked every, + <breathing> worked eleven ] hours every Sunday.	24
my wife and I have [ a, + a ] three year old, almost four and [ a, + a ] two year old.	24
I'd be [ afraid, + <laughter>, afraid ] I probably forgot how to ride a bike, {D you know. }	9
{C and } she got our baby-sitter to start recycling  her newspapers and cans, because that's all she talked about.	24
you get your doctor to give you a more than six months prescription	24
if {D you know } engineering is the thing [ if, + ]  then you've got to at least take engineering.	9
There's was Twins there, or, {D you know } -- -- Skip Williams.	24
{C But, }  {F uh, } -	26
Wow.	21
this is my first job --	24
and -- -- they just want to sue you.	9
{C So. } -	26
I had to document and create a paper chase for all of my students,	24
right.	15
{F Um, } the only way they could do that is by having a real good quality check, {F um, } and also offering some kind of, -	9
<Throat_clearing> {C And so } they're protecting their <laughter> economic interests, I guess.	9
I don't know,	24
{D Well, } I quit ten years ago	24
<Laughter> That's an education in itself.	34
his father was even, the, {F uh, } police chief of the town.	24
{C Plus, } {D you know, } we don't have to go out and buy all the <sigh>  equipment and stuff, {D you know, }	24
{C But, }  I do know that [ some people, +  almost all people ] usually die before that point.	9
All the time,	24
{D Well } that's great.	21
-- {C or } do you send them away to boarding school	25
{C but, } {F uh, } I like the idea.	24
It is,	24
I just, -	26
they were all completely clean,	24
<Laughter> {F Oh } yeah,	36
{C And } {D like } for example, {D see, }  {D okay, } {D like } [ Lith-, + Lithuania ] {D right, } they declared themselves an independent country with a president,	24
{F Uh, } we have a two income -- -- {F uh } family.	24
{C and } I really enjoyed that,	24
Yeah,	36
{C but } to go out and drive, {F uh, } never has really [ been, + had ] any appeal to me -- -- in that regard.	24
{C and } all you do is follow along and enjoy yourself.	9
What does speech have to do with burning a flag?	39
It must just, be on the line.	24
{D Well, } [ tur-, + turn  ] in your forms.	24
I, was from the, {F uh, } twin cities area.	24
Yeah,	15
<Laughter>  No,	13
I don't know,	19
Uh-huh.	15
there's a metal piece that fits through the  belts,  {F uh, }	24
{D Well, } it's hard to say.	17
then it'd be the same result.	9
Maybe it's a place I went to,	24
{C and, } {F uh, } {F um, } I always watch them no matter who's on,	24
{E I mean, } [ [ I don't, + I don't, ] + I don't ] see that it accomplishes a whole lot, <breathing> whereas I do think that convicting people [ and, +    and  ] incarcerating them for a long time, if that could be improved upon, that would have more impact, I think.	9
{C And } they fight with each other	9
Yeah,	15
good to talk to you.	38
{C but } I don't know what it's about.	24
{F Uh, } he made kind of an odd sounding ROBIN HOOD,	24
We take extension cords	24
# Absolutely. #	36
{F Oh, } no.	21
{C so, } -	26
No,	33
{C and } by then it's eight thirty or nine o'clock at night,	24
Probably doing outdoorsie stuff, and [ keeping, + trying to keep ] them away from the T V, I guess <laughter>.  And, McDonald's <laughter>.	24
{F Uh, }	26
{F Uh, }  {C and } your very best teachers in my estimation should be first, second or third grade.  So that  the children develop good learning patterns	9
{C but } only because we got used to, {F uh, } single person, single car, driving.	9
{C and, }  [ it, + it ] had real good tips	24
{C because } their dad was at work	24
Uh-huh.	15
That's hilarious.	21
I have just retired.	24
it's not,	26
we are, {F uh, } somewhat conservative,	36
{F Oh, } it's beautiful.	11
[ You hear a, + you hear a ] Paula Abdul song	24
you sort of feel sorry for a lot of the people there.	24
Uh-huh.	15
<Lipsmack> {C But, } {F uh, } -	26
{C but } toxic [ can be, + can be ] anything that's [ cr-, + ] {F uh, } classified that can damage the Earth.	9
my family was real liberal,	24
{C and } we're getting a house,	24
# {C because, } {F uh, } # -	26
-- [ there's, + I remember that there was ] one game that I played that required forty-eight K	24
Uh-huh.	15
It is.	36
{C or, } -	26
they're [ always, + always ] happy.	9
Huh-uh.	15
Yes.	15
Yeah  <laughter>.	15
Yeah.	15
Unfortunately, [ [ what, + what, ] + ] [ they, + they ] had no idea what they were voting on <laughter> it turns out.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{F Oh, } is it?	12
Yeah.	15
[ [ [ Are, +  d-, ] +  are you, ] + do   you ] play the piano,	7
Okay,	15
What about, {F uh, } {D like } teenagers that get involved in a gang and do a drive by shooting or something like that.  {D Say } fifteen, sixteen year old.	16
[  I, + I, ] -	26
{C But } to me, Texas, {D see } and Kentucky,  we had to have ice on the ground for them to close school.	24
{D Well, } her husband died.	24
{F Oh, } yeah <sniffing>.	15
Right.	36
{C and } we're all pretty much alike,	9
Yeah,	15
{F Uh, } I probably wouldn't mind if it really came down to it.	9
Well they have weddings for dogs now and cats	24
[ I, + {C so } I ] didn't have that problem either.	24
-- {C and } there's other people there,	24
Bye.	38
Yeah.	4
Uh-huh.	15
[ {C and } + -- -- {C and so } ] nobody {D like } really got  stuck with the bill.	24
Yeah,	36
# Uh-huh. #	15
{C And then } I have, {F uh, } a three eighty-six F X a sixteen bit machine, at home.	24
yeah.	26
-- {C or, } {D you know, } [ [ it, + it, ] + it's ]  always trade offs,	9
Yeah,	15
{C And, }  {F um, } there's [ a lot of kids, + a lot of kids. ]	24
{C and } they are, one ... -	24
Uh-huh.	4
This is true.	36
I love it.	24
Yeah,	15
Very restful.	9
{C but, } I think you need that bag to pop out too.	9
That's kind of different.	21
# Yeah. #	15
{C so } I, {D you know, } -	26
[ I can, + I can ] sketch something, like if I see a picture, like, out of a book, I can sketch that --	24
Boy, I tell you.	17
You, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
It depends [ [ r-, +  r-, ] +  really ]  on [ how, + how ] strong a test it is.	24
Do you have one of those straightedge  things to put underneath when you're doing the baseboards?	7
{C And } she said, It's very similar,	24
I think that the trial by jury is better, {F uh, } {D you know, } [ than e-, + ] having a <chiming> unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible.	9
<<Talks to baby very faint>>  (( what you doing )) ?	10
{C so, }  all girls around here <laughter>.	24
Bye-bye.	38
Uh-huh.	15
When he's  ((   )) , # -	26
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F um, } it was <laughter> simply a ploy [ to, + to ] get people, {D you know } -- -- [ to buy, + to buy ] more for, -	9
{F Uh, } it just did not seem that, {F uh, } I do not know, technically we knew what we were doing either.	9
# <Laughter>.  #	20
I think so.	36
# {D well } that's what # I was going to point out, #  I think it mostly is that technical, # -	9
{C and, } -	26
{E I mean, } -	26
{F Oh, } okay.	29
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] I know, a friend of mine talked to someone in the midwest	24
Of course,	36
Uh-huh.	15
{C So } [ we have, + we have ] quite a few parties,	24
{C But, } -	26
both my mother and my husband's mother, we had to end up putting in nursing homes	24
He did a real good job I believe.	9
I do about forty percent of my time [ is + ] on the road.	24
actually [ the, + the ] Blue Ridge in Virginia are closer to Raleigh.	24
A slug is actually kind of slimy --	9
# Uh-huh. #	15
-- I will [ have finished, + be finished ] <laughter> -- -- with that.	24
They hand them money each year	24
I'm trying to think offhand	34
Uh-huh.	15
{C so } it's not like he's going to infect her kids.	24
I'm digressing,	24
I talk to people all over, {F uh, } Texas, {F um,  and only one person  outside [ of the coun-, + {F uh, } of the state, ]	24
it's definitely up to the person, {F uh, }	9
Right.	15
[ {C And, } + {F uh, } {F uh, } {C but } ] automobile races -	26
Uh-huh.	15
{E I mean, } it's like a bonus to go to jail.	9
#  (( Of, -	26
He only has twenty, twenty-five, whatever hours he has to spend on practice.	9
these things won't make any sense to you probably	8
She teaches in the city, of Baltimore,	24
Uh-huh.	15
[ It's, + it's ] the money	9
{F Uh, } why should we let them set in prison  and work on their college degrees after they've mowed down a class yard full of kids   [ or t-, +  or tried to, ] or [ done   their very, +  {D you know, }  given their ] best   effort at doing that.	16
I think they're really going to have to, [ and not, + and not ] just for mothers, for fathers as well.	9
{F Oh, } yes,	36
<laughter>.	20
-- # {C and } # I think we both listed an experience <laughter>.	38
# Yeah. #	15
{C And then } he's got me into making eggs without the yolk.	24
I'm Jay in Dallas.	6
[ [ It, +  it, ] +  it's ]  just an exercise mat that rolls up	24
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah,	15
# Money #  instead.	30
{F Oh, } he wanted to take the  current secondary highway system -- -- and turn it into interstates like the rest of the country.	9
Yeah,	15
{C And, } yeah,	26
{F Uh, } other than that, {F uh, } I don't know,	24
{C but } they don't --	26
same here.	38
they keep me guessing the whole time.	24
{C so } [ I, +  I ] increased,	24
{D Well, } we did not do it right all the time <laughter>.	3
{C because } <laughter> I just, -	26
[ We just, + we just ] went into a building supply store and bought plate glass.	24
((   )) .	26
{C Or } as far as that goes, {D you know, } people think of computers, they think of I B M a lot of times.	9
{E I mean, } {D you know, } I'm not sure that capital punishment serves as a deterrence	24
{D Well, } you have to, in Pennsylvania, boy,	8
They're also talking very seriously about the thing called a dirt gun. Where they're, {F uh, } looking at the emissions from the car using basically a spectrometer and looking at [ the, + ] basically how much of what is coming out of the exhaust.	24
I am pretty much against it <breathing> <laughter>.	24
The specials.	2
that was his whole war	24
Uh-huh.	15
They have.	24
{C So } they stayed six months,	24
uh-huh.	15
[ {C And, } + {F um, } {C but } ] ours is about, -	24
{C And, } its incredible logistics,	9
Uh-huh,	15
I don't know,	19
there's this United Nations or  world government or whatever they keep talking about that the whole world will deal with you.	24
he goes, {F uh, }  the problem was  that there were five people saying  row, row, row and one person rowing, right.	24
<Laughter>.	20
I don't know what that is.	24
{C so } I look at theirs.	24
Yeah,	4
{C but } he just said to me, maybe you ought to try bicycling	24
[ it, + it ] would have been the same as Desert Storm if all they had been  fighting was North Vietnam.	9
Yeah.	15
{C and } I say, no,	25
guess our city, {D you know, } in picking them up must take them somewhere else, # and # get something for them.	24
{C and } that was it.	24
{D you know, }  {C but } then when I went, {F um, } <lipsmack> for graduate work, {D you know, } or for a new job, people said to me, {D you know, } Shippensburg State, where is that, {D you know } <laughter>.	24
Yeah.	15
Right,	36
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
# No <laughter>.	32
{C But }  the problem is that the, {F uh, } as with -	26
# Uh-huh.  #	15
{C And } they're part of the [ ch-, + ]  {F uh, } Plano Children's [ Civics, + Civic ] Chorus.	24
Anyway, {F uh, } I know nothing other than the west.	24
It's like people are starting to  give up hope	9
Right.	36
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
{C and, } {F uh, }  *[[slash unit?]] No,    *[[should be nn, slash bug]]	13
<Laughter>  Oh.	15
It's trying to think,	24
I'm sure my husband will be surprised, 'cause we were talking about them the other day  [ mm- + ] before	24
you're buying these knock offs,	24
[ [ I don't, + {D you know, } I don't,  ] +  I'm not ] into, {D you know, } recipes	24
{C So } about fifteen years ago the German Shepherd  Club of America decided amongst themselves that they were going to change this.	24
{D You know, } I just recently moved to Massachusetts.	24
{C and, }  {F uh, } it's interesting because the county I live in, -	24
No,	36
[ The, + {F uh, } the, ] {F uh } -- -- peremptory challenges are limited to,   I don't know how many,	24
But, uh, -	26
{C and } I don't think that I saw it in him until maybe last year,	24
{C so, } <lipsmack> I don't know.	19
{C And } of course there's no hook,	24
{D well }   what do you believe in,	16
are you there?	7
{C So } it was easier to clean and see where the dirt was	24
{C or } I buy things, {D you know, } I see it on sale	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
{C but } it takes more chewing <laughter>.	9
[ What, +  what ] kind was it?	39
-- {C and } she really likes her school,	24
Oh.	29
<Laughter>.	20
That's another one of my favorites.	24
Yes.	4
I know.	24
Yeah.	15
I know,	24
[ She's, + she's ]  a good watch dog --	24
[ I like the, + I like the ] styling	24
<Throat_clearing>.	20
{C and } one is, {F uh, } four.	24
{C and } {D you know, } we just have our life insurance for right now.	24
Yeah.	15
I'm not at [ the col-, + the big College Park campus, ] {D you know, }	24
there's, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
that's what I think too.	24
I don't think,	32
{C and, }  {F um, } there was always an activity,	24
{C So, }  {F uh, } -	26
Pardon?	14
{C And } I have one aunt that really looks after him a lot.	24
{C but }  {D you know, } -	26
{C So } maybe, that's {D like } the extreme of it.	9
I guess,	11
{F Oh, } do you have a wok though?	7
{C but } [ this is, + {D you know, } this is ] one step above it,	24
It seems like, {F uh, } even when they have consulted day care centers that are quote unquote reputable, that are sort of like a chain, if I can use that word -- -- {F uh, } still you have to deal with the people that, {D you know, } happen to be operating it locally	24
[ There's, {F uh, } one particular, + {D well } there several ]  stations in this area that play, {F uh, } classical music all the time,	24
{F Um, } I thought [ [ the, + {F uh, } the cima-, ] + the cinematography ] was excellent.	24
Yeah.	30
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } there's ice balls the size of marbles all over our lawn.	24
{C and } I think a lot of these people have them maxed out.	9
they thought that was so hysterical.	24
{C but } my biggest problem is, I take the bags out of the store, buy the bags to bring the back,	24
# <Laughter>.  #	20
{C and } [ you, + ] there were some places, where people, defini-, -	24
{C But } [ [ [ I, + I, ] + I, ] + I ] think [ [ that, + that the, ] + that, ] {D you know, } [ the, + ] being in law enforcement, {D you know, } [ [ [ [ [ th-, + th-, ] + th-, ] +  they, ] + I, ] + I ] probably have a kind of a draconian, Philistine attitude toward it.	24
Yeah.	15
[ {C and } + -- -- {C and } ] he was there to paint the French doors also.	24
{C and, } {F uh, } that's often a good way to get back into it again.	9
{F Uh, } for example, was the guy provoked and was the response reasonable given the provocation <noise>.	24
{C And } I laughed real hard when I took it in for the two thousand mile checkup --	24
{D Again, } that is sort of weird, because [ you, + you, ] are not going anywhere	9
-- # {C and } you zip through # it quicker.	24
You will.	9
I guess if you gave the, gave them jobs,	9
{F Um. }	26
Though, {F uh, } Washington, I think is, {F uh, } close by	24
{F Oh } yeah.	36
Yeah.	15
{C and } temperature is the big thing -- -- the Centigrade -- -- for which she says Celsius.	24
{F Oh, } [ I, + I ] believe in the death penalty,	24
{E I mean } [ Louisi-, + Louisiana ] for a small state [ w-, + ] it was amazing	9
there's really bad for you.	9
first off [ we don't, + we don't ] have enough courage to, {F uh, } pick out the people [ that, + that ] have some sort of indication of possible drug usage, {F uh, } because that would offend them, {F uh, } [ if they, + if they ] weren't.	9
{C but, } {F um, } # {D you # know, } you get a [ lot of, + ] {F uh, }  great variety of things here,	24
{C And } they make, {F uh, } {F oh, } about a foot high plant.	24
Lexus is a Toyota subbrand.	22
{F Uh, } everything else was fine,	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } I haven't seen it.	24
# Yeah. #	15
# There's just # -- -- so much, {F uh, } more and less money to do it with.	9
{C but, } {C and } I get so depressed [ because, + not because ]  I can't find a job, but because I can't figure out what I want to do.	24
it froze in fact.	25
Yeah.	15
{C and } we go there, {F uh, } once a year.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } he had ripped my wallpaper off my wall.	24
Yeah.	15
<<ends conversation with husband>>. He was trying to think of what the name of it was,	24
{D well } [ they wo-, + they won't ] take a no for an answer here for some reason.	24
Oh.	15
Yeah.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Okay.	38
Okay.	15
<Printer> Yeah,	36
{C or } they're considering going to Baylor,	24
[ if, + if ] someone says I am not interested I'll just say fine and back out.	24
did you go?	7
{C And } they do it that way?	7
[ {C or, } +  {F um, } {C and } ] I think she was encouraging other people to do it if they would.	24
some they do. -	9
# {C But, } # -	26
# {C so } we # decided to just cancel it.	24
That's right <laughter>.	36
{C and } we play bingo with them and,  {D you know, } {D like, } -- -- stuff like that.	24
{F Um, }  as a little girl I'd go with my dad and my uncle and my brother,	24
# <Laughter> # {F Oh. }  No I was just  down in Austin last week	24
{C But, } {F oh, } -	26
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
# {F oh, } # my little boy [ just, + ] he went wild.  {D You know, } [ I + mean ] [ because, + because ] he had been used to me -- -- being there -- -- all the time,	24
No,	33
Right.	15
Right.	15
My wife had, {F uh, } just put in a bunch of, I want to say,  they are pansies.	24
Yeah.	15
{C and } there's just so much military machine there.	9
{C And } all the neighbors said they heard  her yelling for help.	24
we're just above Carmel,	24
you have to go all the way to Dallas.	24
I have nothing to say about this.	24
[ Did, + di-, ] -	26
{C and } [ [ they, + they were, ] + {D you know, } they were ] pretty much without having to say, they were pretty much Mets fans <laughter>.	24
{C so. } -	26
# {F Uh, } I'd like to see SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. #	24
they're all brand new engines,	24
Yeah,	15
Bye,	38
Uh-huh.	15
# Yeah. #	15
I go by myself	24
Yeah.	15
K O A -s are wonderful.	24
{C or } I don't want to do anything.	24
{C and } he just kind of hobbled down the halls real slow.	24
{E I mean } [ I al-, + I almost ] got hooked on it cause everybody would took  about it at dinner and everything else	24
{C And } they're asking {D like } for a,  {F uh, } G P A of like three point seven or  # something # -- -- like that.	24
{E I mean } they're nomadic farmers, {D you know, }	24
yeah,	36
<Noise>.	20
{C and } now they're,  {D you know, } -	26
{C And then } I just decided that I was just missing a lot of their time whether they were so little	24
looking at T I, you see them in management,  but you're not seeing them up there as V P -s.	9
{C and } the car now has a hundred and  thirty something thousand miles on it	24
it's like how much money did the  U S spend when they could have paid so  much money for each barrel of oil that was being, -	16
All right.	15
# Yeah,	26
<Laughter> Yeah.	15
{C and } I've them walk with me along the lakefront --	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C So, } [ that's, + that's ] really neat.	21
{D Well, } [ we're, + we're ] <baby_crying> expecting our first in about three months,	24
[ if, + if ] young people had to do it -- -- {F um, } maybe that would start the trend back because that's one of the things I always <breathing> thought was a wonderful part of our country.   # {F Um, } # -- -- is helping others <<pause>> <noise>.	9
{C And, }  {F uh, } they've got Perkins,	9
{D Well } <noise> <<Sounds like eating something>>.	26
[ when I, + each time that I  ] thought that the Indians were going to get killed, I cried.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C And } it answers everything.	9
do they have a mail <noise>  kind of campaign that they send to professionals in the, # social, #	7
that's nice out there.	21
{D well, } I know even if you  watched A B C, N B C or the other,	24
yeah,	15
Yeah.	15
I've got some applications,	24
{C But } usually [ [ if I'm, + if I'm, ] + if I ] take a day off or on the weekend especially, I try to # cook, # [ real, + real ] food.	24
Uh-huh.	15
{D You know, } he does that full time with the bank, {D you know. }	24
Uh-huh.	15
I still believe I get very fed up with government  sometimes	24
{C and } I think that may be where jury use is overdone,	9
Are you just saying [ you, + you ] sight read every concert?	7
Uh-huh.	15
Pretty much,	36
I don't know,	24
I know too many people who use a calculator	24
Okay.	13
{C So } apparently it costs less that way.	24
{D so }  {C but. } -	26
-- {C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } sometimes [ it can, + [ those choi-, + those choices ] can ] be made in advance	24
[[w-, + w-,] + ] onto no control, -	24
[ {C and, } +  {C and, } ]  {F um } <lipsmack>, -	26
<Laughter> Well I'm sure it's been done.	9
{C And } it rains, {D you know, } a lot there.	24
{F Uh, } {C because, } [ [ I would think, +   I think, ] +  (( {D you know, } ))  mentally, {F uh, } and  emotionally, I think ] women can handle a job and, every bit as well.	24
{C and }  the first thing that happens you have to share [ your, + your ] whole living space, with someone that you have never known before in your # life. #	9
we finally sold his boa constrictor,	24
{C and then } they learn such bad things in jail.	9
I am, too.	36
{C but } I think maybe, {F uh, } -	26
they always had a good plot.	9
{C so } we get away from [ the, + the ] smog.	24
# Uh-huh.  #	15
Yes,	4
Great.	21
Yeah,	4
{F Um. }	15
nurses that used to work in the hospital take care of [ infants, + infants ] and then only up to like  two years old --	24
Right.	15
{C and } I looked at the Galant	24
{F Um. }	26
[ I, + I ] look at the Cadillacs	24
Run on that then, no income taxes in Texas, {F huh?  }	16
Uh-huh.	15
[ Most of, + [ most, + most ] of ] the land's pretty brown.	24
{C And then } on television, you have just the news at six and  ten.	24
{C and so } I said, Hey, this was a cinch,	24
{C But, } he  has really developed into a marvelous character actor as he has come older.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } -- -- those were just kind of good old cartoons.	9
the whole bathroom is covered from ceiling to foot in tile	24
{F Oh, } I see.	15
I am not famil-, -	26
{C but, } {F uh, } I guess we're pretty naive coming from small towns, {F uh, } in the midwest and then, {F uh, } moving to a larger city where there are drive-by shootings	9
{D well } it's been nice talking with you.	38
-- {C and, } {F uh, } scholarships were  very beneficial in my case to help pay for my education, because my parents couldn't.	24
# That's # one of the things that we do.	24
They, are all things to all people,	9
{C But then } I thought about it	24
Yeah,	4
Uh-huh.	15
Oh.	29
When we visit Minnesota though we go to see her.	24
most of your liberal arts degrees and stuff aren't really concerned with your first two years anyway.	24
{D Well, } [ you, + where you're ] located, [ I, +  I ] do know Texas Instruments has random drug testing.	24
{C and } {F uh, } [ it's really, + it's ] harder to get out of bed in the morning and all kinds of stuff,	24
{C and } we had thought before maybe a lot older we don't need  such a large house that we'll sell it,	24
[ [ Have you ever used, + do you use WordPerfect ever? ] +  Have you ever used WordPerfect? ]	7
{C But, } I think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it.	9
{C and } my wife didn't know,	24
{C so } they have to start talking about it, or getting their act together about six months ahead to get in touch with everybody, # because # they're rather socially active too.	24
I think, {F uh, } this political situation over there now is, {F uh, } {F uh, } -	9
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
{D Well, } it's because of oil isn't it?	7
{F Uh, } overall [ I, + I, ] -	26
# Yeah. #  <Laughter>.	15
I'm Catholic <laughter>.	24
{C and } does the company pay for it.    {D You know, } all or  partially	24
There's still a lot [ to be + <breathing>, {D you know, } to be ] accomplished,	9
[ That -- + -- that ] would be something.	21
The others were hand me downs through the families.	24
{C but } if you, {D you know, } have a family [ and, + and, ] {F um, } everybody's gone to different doctors, {F uh, } it is hard to give up somebody who you feel knows you and your body and [ your, + ] just has, {D you know, } all the medical history	9
They liked it.	24
because I think it affected people's lives on, in a way that you could see.	9
{D You know, } {D so. }  {D Well, } I guess that's about all I can tell you about my exercising.	24
{D Well, } we really enjoy prime rib, too,	24
<Laughter>.	20
you have a good evening.	38
{F Um, } it, -	26
I know,	36
{C and } it stayed on all night, {D you know } -- -- just shining right down on them, {D you know } --	24
I like that.	24
Yeah.	15
# That, -	26
{C and } [ he, + he ]  put together the, {F uh, } the bullets in it --	24
{C so } I can call myself a Brooklyn thug, although I'm really not.	24
{C but } it seems that, {D you know, } they can sign him tomorrow,	24
# {C But, } {F uh, } # -	26
Even though my, {F um, } mother's people are from Georgia.	24
{C but, } {D you know, } I didn't think it was as good as all the, {F uh, } hype was about it.	9
Going to actually shop at Best Buy [ for, + {A Best Buy is one of our electronic stores } -- -- for ] fax machines, things like that, instead of going through these office supply companies that mark up their amounts and say, {D you know, } I'll give you a legal pad for five bucks,	9
{F Uh, } yes,	36
It's almost more fun {D really, }	9
And yet by the same token, I think some of it is jealousy,	9
we've swung the pendulum both ways.	9
Yeah.	15
{F oh, } it's just so many -- -	9
{F Uh. }	15
{C and } that, -	26
{C and, } we were watching, {F uh, } {F oh } gosh, BUGS BUNNY just last night --	24
That's good.	21
How about you?	31
That's the best way.	9
# Yeah. #	15
Okay,	15
I don't think so.	5
-- {C and } they did not know how to take care of that,	24
Right.	15
Uh-huh.	15
It has been untypically wet for this time of year,	24
Yeah.	15
Are you in Texas?	38
# {C But } she had no help? #	7
but I won't let them get, -	24
uh-huh,	26
{F Oh. }	15
Uh-huh.	15
It would seem to spread it out a  little better if the employers who, {F uh, } employ these people, and pay them, {F uh, }  {D you know, } subminimum wages or whatever, were asked to [ sh-, +  share ]  their fair burden of this too, just as my employer is.	9
{C and } I don't know if we're going to stay here or not, depends,	24
[ If you, +  if you ] don't like it,  [ wait + ] five minutes, it'll change.	24
I grew up next door to, {F uh, }  the Richardson Symphony Orchestra leader	24
[ you say, + say you  ] get another week and, -	24
{D You know, } I was going home the other day	24
{C and } that's where, {F uh, } leaders can [ use, + {F uh, } use  ] that whenever the opportune moment arises.	9
is he young?	7
{E I mean, } [ I get, + I get ]  at least one or two a week. People, [ t-, + ] {D you know, } sending me a credit  card or calling me on the phone  [ and + ] I just say I don't want it.	24
I don't know if it will come out.	24
I just remember,	26
{C And } he's really enjoying that.	24
# Uh-huh. #	15
One of them was for a couple of years	34
Yeah.	15
{F Oh, } {D well, } that's good	21
<Talking> # Bye-bye. #	38
# {D Well } # -- -- # {D well, } [ who, +  who ]  else # is going to do this, then?	39
{D Now } the problem [ is, +  is ] that nobody's going to invade anybody else's boundaries.	9
{D Well, } especially around, {F uh, } {D you know, } equipment, machinery and stuff.	9
New York -	26
[ the, + {F uh, } I ] just changed my [ oil, + oil ] tonight	24
{D Well, } we did, {D you know, } -	24
[ you've got, + we've got ] to keep it now.	25
{C and } it was one of the big targets	24
Yeah.	4
The rest of it is just {D like } wild flowers --	24
[ what was # -- + -- what was ] that movie that they had out?	39
no,	36
{D well, } the previous owner had a major problem with it, because, {F uh, } {F oh } probably a variety of things.	24
Now if you  use the dried kind? Then you would only use two of them.	18
[ I think that, +  {F uh, } I think the ] laws have gotten so lenient, {D you know }	9
I haven't given that a lot of thought [ if, + if  ] it [ should, + should ] go, {D you know } --    *[[slash error]] -- to be, -	24
I'm not certain that people [ [ are, + are, ] + are ] terribly concerned about other people.	9
{F Oh } really.	15
{C But } that's good that you're going to get another one.	9
{F Oh, } no.	21
I was amazed at how many cans -- -- # that # we got  ((   ))	24
{C but } she does work with them	24
Yeah,	15
I just wish they'd bring some of the old characters back.	24
no,	27
<Laughter>.	20
I like to watch DESIGNING WOMEN if the kids -- -- are in bed by then.	24
Acoustics.	24
Yeah.	15
{C and, } I thought, {F oh, } this  will be an easy class.	9
Can you picture that?	7
{C And, } not too many people want Bombays.	9
{C And, } {F uh, } one show that  comes to mind is {D like } DESIGNING WOMEN.   {F Uh, }	24
[ I saw, + I saw ] a guy,	24
{C but, } [ I, + {F uh, } I ] do telemarketing,	24
that kind of thing,	24
{E I mean } I can't even imagine, {D you know, }  trying to, {F um, } -	24
{C But, }  <breathing> we always did, {F uh, } {F oh, } just, {D you know, } to the park for walks -- -- and to the zoo and museum.	24
# Uh-huh.  #	15
I'm, {F uh, } -	26
yeah,	4
{C But, }  {F uh, } -	26
[ They, + they ] know how to deal with the penal system	9
Mandatory, {E I mean, } summary execution,  on the steps, that day.	9
if somebody came and she liked them and she went outside with them  [ and, + ] it's hard to drag her away <Laughter>.	24
{C and } [ they'll, + they'll ] call you back.	24
Wow.	21
Yeah.	15
{C and, } -	26
Flooding anywhere.	17
Uh-huh.	29
{C and } now all of a sudden they're going home	24
Sure.	36
your, -	26
{C So } I really did.	24
<laughter> I think some parents go a little bit overboard.	9
Yeah,	15
that's right.	21
<TV> Yes.	36
{F Um, } our children are both grown	24
okay.	29
Are you all located in Texas?	7
That's exactly it.	21
{E I'm sorry, } it was actually not a particularly great nursing home.	24
real close.	36
the only thing about the costuming my husband remarked  [ that it didn't, + [ that, + that, ] ] {F um, } the Indians all appeared to be wearing new things.	24
{C and } you're not going to bother if you have one  bag full, to drive all the way to some recycling center  to turn in just your little plastic peanuts <laughter>.	9
And so I moved,	24
{C but } one thing I did learn  was how deep [ the +  the ] hatred runs toward Israel by a lot of countries.	24
I don't know,	24
# {D [ E-, + exactly ] }	36
{F Uh, } {D now } I've heard of Striper.	24
we did it as a family,	24
{D Well, } {F uh, } just really the last couple of days  since [ this, + {F uh, } the,  ] U N debate or whatever you want to call it that, {F uh, } voted on whether there was going to be a cease fire.	11
it's kind of nice <laughter>.	24
{C So } we use it quite a bit --	24
Did you see [ the, + the ] C N N, [ the, + the ] dog show, {F uh, }	7
{C so } they got turned down	24
If you're busy, that has always been a legitimate excuse. If you are incapacitated, ill health,	9
Right.	36
{C And, }  {F uh, } -	26
{F Um, } [ there's, + {D you know, } there's ] a lot of things like that.	9
Come on,	13
{C And, }  {F uh, } I read a lot of science fiction.	24
Exactly.	11
{C or, } -	26
{D Well, } it was worth the buck I guess.	24
I like getting the paper and <noise> reading the want ads	24
{C but } they like to have enough to be comfortable.	9
I pressed one	24
we [ 've +  have, ]  {F uh, } done a little painting ourselves, {F um, }	24
{D Well } it's been nice talking to you.	38
Yeah.	30
{C And } I did pay state tax in California,	24
{C So. }   {D Well, } it's certainly, {F uh, } {F uh, } -	26
{C So, } [ [ it's really, +  <throat_clearing> it's, ] + it's ]  kind of a show piece	24
have something to rebel against <laughter>. -	22
this is different for us because the other, -	24
[ If, + if ] they want the firepower they can get it.	9
{D Well, } [ it, + it ] is a latex paint,	34
Yes.	4
# Yeah.	15
Yeah.	15
Yeah.	4
[ I got, + I got ] my Buick as a high school graduation gift.	24
{C And, } {F um, } her son, which is my father is also elderly,	24
Uh-huh.	15
There were none prior to nineteen-hundred.	24
Um.	15
{C or } how do you feel about that?	35
Right.	36
I hadn't seen anything since DANCES WITH WOLVES	24
{C but }  you sit there in a crowd,	24
[ it, + {F uh, } it ]  would seem to me that there are other things that the administration could do.	9
{C and } it's preconstructed you might say.	24
Uh-huh.	15
that's true.	38
# Uh-huh <baby>.  #	15
that might not turn around in the next, {D you know, } [ fifteen, + twenty ] years.	24
I think, I've kind of become a Rangers fan over the last eleven years since I've been here.	24
{C But } [ it's, + # it ] # was written, -	26
I know that with, -	26
{F Oh, } my gosh.	21
it gets people [ to, + ] {F uh, }   doing it, {D you know, }	9
{C But } -- -- there wasn't anything for,  {D you know, } rifles and things like that.	24
yeah.	26
{C So } that is probably something that plays a <child_talking> big factor. <throat_clearing>	9
-- {C and then } they would have like a ten dollar deductible per year for my medicine,	24
You have five?	14
{C But, } have you ever been in a situation where [ you, + you ] were drug tested	7
[  We, + I ] live in Yakima, Washington.	24
okay,	26
I'm afraid I'm a T V flipper.	24
{C but } you don't want to get off the beaten track.	24
[ it, + it ] still, -	26
Okay.	15
[ it's, + {F uh, } there are ] many better machines on the market right now  -- -- for a, -	9
it's kind of fun. #	24
{D so } [ the, +   the ] cold weather can kill them --	24
Uh-huh.	38
{C But } it's that not getting involved,  that impersonal society, I think we live in today.	9
right,	36
{F Oh, } gosh.	21
Right.	15
{D You know. }  {C And } I like the time because my kids, sometimes they come with me	24
Most of the time.	9
that made a nice ugly sound.	9
Most of them probably wouldn't do something like that. Although there are a lot of kids who would do it  just to get away from their parents <laughter>.	9
Yeah.	15
Okay,	29
They come out of nurseries mostly in Missouri  and places like that.	24
My husband hasn't been to Europe yet	24
No,	33
Yeah.	15
{F Uh, }	26
{D you know, } {E I mean, } somebody will see a figure from the past that nobody else does	24
{C But } I think with their new stadium, they should go and let, -	9
Uh-huh.	15
Do you work for T I?  <noise>	7
{D Well, } [ they didn't, + they didn't ] have a since of risk.	8
{C But } [ they, + they  ] really do,	24
[ I can, wo-, + I can actually work ] on that engine.	24
[ I don't, + I don't ] care for the smell of the litter box	24
{C and } if he can't produce evidence -- -- not argument, but evidence, -	9
I couldn't see that there was  a clear majority [ that, +  that ] stayed.	24
[ {C but, } +  {C but } ] it is good reading	9
# {F Oh, } that's # nice.	21
{D Like } the Mayor of Dallas is a woman.	24
{D well, } when she got her first one she was so excited	24
{F Oh, } yeah.	15
Uh-huh,	4
Yeah,	4
{F Uh, } {C but } now I find myself using the computer,	24
Pardon me --	14
{C and } he found a Norwegian elkhound	24
Bye-bye.	38
{C And } I'd like to have a compact disc player in the car.	24
Uh-huh.	15
this is [ a, + ] {F uh, } {F Uh, } probably suspension tied into -- -- the brakes.	9
Uh-huh.	15
{D You know, } I just feel like  maybe we went in to be policeman	24
Uh-huh.	15
Okay.	36
Wh-, -	26
{C and } -- -- you could just really relax there and enjoy it.	24
It's full time work.	24
Yeah.	36
{D So, } {D well, } I don't know	19
I can, -	26
My wife took my daughters one year when they were getting some points for school, took them to an elderly home,	24
{F um, } this is very frightening in that, {F uh, } {F oh, } -	24
<Breathing>  How should they do it?	39
{C and, } {F uh } -- -- California, always trying to  sell something, [ oil, +  oil ] investments or  # stock investments # -- -- or whatever.	24
Yeah.	15
{C but } <laughter> when I do  I try   to keep it pretty simple on things that I can prepare ahead of time <beep>,	24
I think that will do it.	11
She's old.	8
{C and  so }   that's kind of why, I guess,  they stuck us with more brick when there were -- -- other homes that didn't have any.	24
Uh-huh.	15
You can even make it with chicken or  you can make it with seafood.	24
Yeah,	29
I can understand that very easily.	24
I don't need to.	30
So many of us have led sheltered lives -- -- that, {F uh, } when we  [ go into a, + ] sit in on, a jury, -	9
{C but } [ [ [ it's still, + it's some -- ] + -- it's, ] + it's ] almost four hundred hou-, -	24
I really beli-,	9
{F Oh } really.	15
{C and } everyone kept saying, {F oh, } you're going up north it's not going to be so hot,	24
Uh-huh.	15
Is that a big, thick book?	7
<Laughter>.	20
{F Uh, } if you have other people in your  family who are also musical.	8
{C and, }  {F uh, } you just bring the covered dishes.	24
I, {F um, } -	26
{F Uh, } {C and }  that's, -	26
I don't know.	19
<Noise>.	20
I lived in the midwest for a while.	24
Not to really pull on those. -	26
No,	33
{C and, } {F uh } -- -- I've got three of them	24
-- {C and } we have manufacturing plants all around the world -- -- including some places where the use of certain drugs that are illegal here are not illegal.	24
Yeah.	15
{C And } in the long-term, -	26
go ahead.	18
{D Well, } it would get messy, too.	9
{C and } I don't see why it couldn't be shortened considerably.	9
{C but } I don't know it as well.	24
{C and } [ it is, + I would imagine in terms [ of, + of ] size and so forth,  it's  ] relatively typical for the area.	24
if I had filed the letter to  dispute it and then paid it eventually, it would have been okay.	24
{F Oh, } I see.	29
That helps a whole bunch.	24
# Carpools, {F uh, } # -	2
<Throat_clearing> I know it.	21
{D wel-, } {C because } that's the way [ they, + they ]  might seem outwardly,	24
{F Oh, } nice.	21
[ {C but. } + {C But, } ] for the most part, [ I, + {D you know, } I've ] really feel like that's led, -	9
You bet.	36
Is that the eagle?	7
[ I, + I ] bought that one,	24
{C so } we don't have to have quite as strict, {F uh, } a budget as we did.	24
That, and a marvelous hairdo.	2
<Laughter>.	20
Really,	15
-- {C and } [ I, + I ] think there's an attempt to do that.	9
{D Now } [ if you, + if you ] pay your monthly charge, do you then pay separately for classes your taking?	7
# It's # handy.	9
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
Uh-huh.	15
{C and then } I kind of get turned off by it. Other than GOOD HOUSEKEEPING.	24
Teen.	30
okay,	15
Radial arm saw is, I guess, what they're called.	9
I know the only other place that I was ever at  where they really had it mixed [ was, + was ] in Panama, where's a lot of the road  signs and everything are [ in, + in ] miles per hour	24
I'd like to go to New Orleans.	24
We're from Illinois originally.	24
{D Well, } {D Well, } you do.	13
{C and } we grow a lot of food.	24
{C but, } it was when I was a child.	24
somehow we picked the right time and, {F uh, } walked down on the wharf,	24
{D well, } we just went to the, {F uh, } Myererson Symphony Run this past weekend,	24
where are you going to move to?	39
<Laughter>.	20
Uh-huh.	15
that is hard.	36
my love wasn't there for the game.	24
oh.	15
No,	32
Bye <Noise> <<like video game>>.	38
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } when that's over with, [ that's, + that's ] it, without even giving a second thought to  ((   )) , advancing their education or getting extracurricular, {F um, } education,	9
my involvement hasn't been direct	24
-- {C and, } {F uh, } I was really disappointed in it,	24
# Cook. #	2
It, -	26
{C But } I thought, {D well } I am, # not going to do that # <laughter>.	24
{C And, } {F um, } {D well } even up here at school, {D you know, } it gets hot, and we have the windows open,	24
That's correct.	21
{C and } [ where are you from, +  where are you calling from? ]	39
just sure as anything, the Japanese are going to come out with a laptop at half the price -- -- with more stuff on it.	9
Right.	15
It's a child's movie,	24
They're <TV> <child> <clanging>, -	26
Uh-huh.	15
just, -	26
# Yeah,	36
What generation are you,	39
# Yes, #	36
I like that.	24
-- {C but, } it was a nightmare back when Cheryl was little	24
{D Well, } [ if + ] [ it, + it  ] depends on how elaborate you get it.	40
-- {C and } the Saudis are our allies.	24
{C and } that's no fun.	24
I understand.	24
[ [ [ I, + I, ] + [ fr-, + ]  {D you know, } I, ] + I ] debate about whether it's really good or not, {D you know. }	24
{F Uh, } {D so, } Jack, what type of music do you like?	31
{D Well, } I think a lot more people could  vote if they were somehow persuaded that it's something worth caring about.	9
{C So } if you've got thirty in there it  normally comes out to about thirty-four dollars so when you pay five it's a pretty  good savings.	24
Okay, {F uh, }	15
Sure.	15
I never had known anyone to play one before.	24
You can [ be, + {F uh, } get ] in trouble for that.	9
# Uh-huh. #	15
Or don't look, even look at that.	9
{D Well, } [ I + <smack> I ] had a real challenge of planning a family reunion a few years ago,	24
Yeah.	36
Oh.	15
{F Oh, } I think the longest was less than a year,	24
right.	36
Uh-huh,	15
It would be nice if they could get them together.	9
Yeah.	15
okay.	29
Yeah,	36
Uh-huh.	15
Yeah.	15
{C and } that's who I stayed with.	24
{F Uh, } it's not as peppy [ as  a, + as a ] Town Car --	9
{C and, } {D you know, } you can see the three spark plugs there in the front.	24
You want to start?	7
Those are the ticket <laughter>.	36
It is.	36
{F Uh, } we try to go once, maybe twice a summer.  {F Uh, } # <Laughter> [ we, + ] {F uh, } just, {D you know, }  for # {D like } a short weekend or something.	24
yeah.	15
right,	36
<breathing>.	20
Yeah,	36
{C and } I wear anything from jeans, when I'm feeling really casual to, {F uh, } suits and dresses when I'm meeting with a customer	24
Uh-huh.	15
{C and } they simply define it as a duty there.	24
Yeah.	15
[ [ {C and then } it, + then it, ] + then it ] became winter like, {F uh } -- -- [ today it's, + today it's ] sort of change to  warmer to sort of more typical autumn day.	24
uh-huh.	15
{C and, } I'm divorced,	24
Of course, you got to charge it and keep your cash.	9
Yeah,	4
Uh-huh.	15
I -- -	26
though I think the Chevies, -	9
The weather [ is, + {F uh, } this time of  year has actually been ] kind of unusual.	9
{D Well } I think, {F uh, } one thing  that we'll see is that we won't be educating everybody.	9
Right.	15
It keeps going,	9
