{D well, } I know out in some, -  __label__39
In spite of all the promises.  __label__40
Yes,   __label__31

Okay.   __label__14
Although she, herself, had never really  accepted Jesus or gone through any of the other, {F uh, } Christian, {F uh, }  portions [ of, +  of ] the faith, repentance, baptisms, et cetera, et cetera.    She had always felt a very strong, {F uh, } leaning in this direction.   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
[ I'll, + I'll ] never understand it.   __label__39
[ up, + up ] around San Francisco, -  __label__39
{C and } I was real upset   __label__39
Uh-huh,   __label__11
Yeah,   __label__11
{C And } they make more money if you extend your loan.  __label__39
I see.  __label__13
our own fault because we elected them.  __label__1
{C and } I suspect that it's probably <noise>, just a fluke, {D you know. }   __label__40
{C or } that, -  __label__0
it's just about twelve miles south of, the New York border.  __label__39
{C And } [ it's very, + it's really ] disturbing  but a good movie.  __label__39
Yeah,   __label__7
Uh-huh.  __label__31
Really?  __label__17
I don't know if  that's just a symptom of society and the breakdown of family and everything   __label__40
They're not willing to tell the truth.    The same way with, {F uh, } issues of, {F uh, } race and things like that  <throat_clearing>.   __label__40
it's there.  __label__40
-- most of, + ] unless I'm going to something special that my daughter's doing, or something like that,  __label__1
Right.   __label__7
{C and then } on Friday most everybody  wears [ jeans, + jeans and sweatshirts, ] or, {D you know, } jeans and blouses or something like that.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
<Laughter>. __label__43
Yeah.   __label__11
{D Anyway, } {F um, } I guess it's, - __label__0
{C and } they'd just play   __label__39
# that # one person has total control,  __label__1
yep.  __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
{D you know, }   __label__1
[ {C because } I, +  {C and } I ]  went out there one day and the plant  was [ noth-, + nothing ] left but a stem,  __label__1
# {E I mean } # -- __label__0
Boy,  haven't that we though.   __label__7
{C and then, } {F uh, } they went bankrupt   __label__39
{C but, } {C and }  cruise control and tinted windows, that's about it, <laughter>.   __label__39
it must be fun to be able to play it   __label__40
{C But } [ some schools, +  some high schools ] have actually started [ a program of + {D like } a visitation program  ] to, {F uh, } {D you know, } [ areas economically, + {F uh } -- __label__39
-- it's not always convenient to do it.  __label__39
it's like mama in the back kitchen, huh?  __label__37
{C or } I have a headache   __label__39
sometimes -- __label__39
Not up, {F um, } where I live   __label__28
[ [ You, + you, ] + you ] know about August then.  __label__38
-- {C so } it's like completely opposed.   __label__39
A year.  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__31
{C and } I don't know how they sort that.   __label__39
but see the thing when Panama was, uh, the, that, uh, Noriega was, uh, was, was, uh, was wanted fo-, either the F B I, by the F B I,   __label__40
Right.  <<Tape ends with no further conversation.>>  __label__11
-- shell --  __label__1
-- casual -- __label__1
{D Well, } [ that, + that ] just seems to be a person who just [ [ doesn't care about much of anything around, [ sort of, + {D you know, } doesn't, + doesn't, ] + ] sort of, ] likes rights probably, but doesn't like [ respon-, + responsibilities. ]  __label__40
Uh-huh.   __label__11
# {C and } do # you know what he told  me I [ h-, + ] needed to do?  __label__32
Yeah.  __label__11
aren't, {F uh, } -  __label__0
{C and } [ I, + I ] went after it   __label__39
That's good.  __label__13
Yeah.  __label__11
my name's Diane.  __label__23
[ {C but, } + {C but } ] then, again, [ we really, + we really ] do have it as a society to decide which things we need to address <breathing>.   __label__40
{F Uh, } they do not have to keep making up stuff if they want to make something good.  __label__39
{C but } then wh-, - __label__0
Our most recent series of projects I guess, [ was, + inside was, ] {F uh, } we remodeled a bathroom recently.  __label__39
{C But } [ [ it really, +  it's ] not, + [ [ it, + it, ] + it ]  doesn't ] burn or anything like that.   __label__39
I don't, -  __label__0
{D Well, } that may be so,   __label__7
They all look the same to me, {D you know. }  __label__5
{F Oh, } no.  __label__13
{F Um, } {F huh. }  {D Well, } I don't like  it when, {F uh, } people listen to my phone conversations, like if they're outside my door while I'm talking in my room <laughter>, __label__39
-- have a, {F uh, } little bit of chop,   __label__1
I didn't mean, {D you know, } I didn't mean like Sweden going over to right hand drive or  anything, {D you know, } <laughter>   __label__39
{C and, } {F uh, } I think it's going to cost us, per couple, about three hundred dollars for the week.  __label__39
{C and } that's where she was from.  __label__39
Especially some of the jobs, {F um, } -  __label__40
{D you know. }  {F Uh, } [ if you have, I guess, + if  ] you wanted to record something to play out in your car or something, __label__1
Yes.  __label__11
Yeah.   __label__11
{C and } [ I still +  even then I was  [ so, + so ] disgusted with it [ I, + I ] ] tried to read, I don't remember which other  one it was,   __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
Yeah   __label__11
{C And } her health is not that bad.   __label__39
{D you know, }    it'd be kind of fun to be able to play with it.   __label__40
{D Well, } {D now, } {D so } if you were going to have a dinner party, what would you make?  __label__35
that was not a lot of community involvement   __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
-- # doesn't always get emphasized # -- __label__1
Uh-huh.   __label__11
It's just slapstick comedy <laughter>.  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
I wonder if,  {D you know, } maybe I need to bring that to someone's attention, {D you know, }  __label__39
{C so. } - __label__0
Yeah.   __label__7
{C But, } {D you know, } [ I, + I ] drive a little Subaru.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
-- {F um, } [ a + a ] real intense burglar can just get another dog that's in heat.  __label__40
Yeah.  __label__11
{E Sorry } I roped on Volvos then <laughter>.  __label__21
Uh-huh.  __label__11
[ Hadn't, + they hadn't, ] - __label__0
{C but } most of that, it was done with a sprayer and, {F uh, } up in the bucket of a  loader tractor, or  something like that,   __label__39
# Uh-huh.  #  __label__11
[ I don't think that + I don't think that ] {F uh } we __label__1
{C and } [ he, + they ]  said that he was twelve years old,   __label__39
I thought that was cute, too.  __label__7
I do,   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I do too.   __label__39
Yeah.   __label__11
{C and } it was just such a delightful time.   __label__39
{C And } they had already told me, We located one at Town North.   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
Of course, that period too was probably difficult.  __label__40
{F uh, } whether one might conceive,  <laughter> no pun intended, of the possibility that there might be a kind of  [ a deliberate, + {F uh, } {F uh } -- __label__1
{C so, then } it -  __label__0
How old is your granddaughter?  __label__35
Yeah.  __label__11
{C and, } {F uh, } we really didn't have things like that going on -- __label__39
But, - __label__0
It had held onto a small portion,   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C And then } this guy from [ Federal, +  Federal ] Express comes along.   __label__39
She's real sweet.   __label__39
Possibly in the jury selection would be the only, - __label__40
Yeah.  __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__31
-- {C and } I thought, {F Oh, } how  violent, {D you know, } to kill the rabbit.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
<Laughter>. __label__43
Okay, <laughter>.   __label__18
{C And } I said, You haven't heard about tornados <laughter>.  __label__39
<laughter> {F Uh, } one picks up real quick   __label__39
{F Oh } yes,  __label__11
I don't know.   __label__25
{C And } Costner got best director.  __label__39
{F Oh, } it's okay.  __label__15
That's really in the last thirty years has changed significantly.  __label__39
{C And, }  {F uh, }  I don't know what they could do more of exactly around here right now other than, {F uh, } <lipsmack> -  __label__39
-- {C and } where it's a very large town, -  __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
{D Like, } {F uh, } one company had proposed to me that I could come back to work after having the baby, {F um, } any where between ten and forty hours a week. __label__39
He's got to be pretty much,  {D you know, } -  __label__40
-- {E I mean } [ [ [ I've, +  I've, ] + I, ] + I have ] friends and family who order from them because [ you can, + you can ] [ literally, +  {A I've heard stories where you can } literally ] buy something from them one year, wear it for a year and a half,   __label__39
# It was very interesting. #  __label__39
-- [ was, + {D you know, } became  ] more mainstream, top forty. - __label__40
{D Well, } there are a lot of things  that people, I think general, - __label__40
{C and, } {D you know, } I'm going, like, [ I, + I ] don't understand how they're supposed to be my servants  and yet they're paid more than I am --  __label__39
-- {C but } you just really can't watch a lot of that.   __label__39
-- {C but } since last time we've gotten more like a dollar.  __label__1
Yeah.   __label__31
Of course, they drag a lot of drugs with them   __label__39
{C And, } __label__0
{C and } too many people are just dying. __label__40
{D Well, } great,   __label__13
{D see I } tape MURDER SHE WROTE.  __label__39
I, -  __label__0

<Breathing>. __label__43
{C and } they said, {D well, } bring them in this week for a free day   __label__39
yeah.  __label__0
# {F um, } # {C or } ] she wouldn't buy  me the fifty dollar tennis shoes and stuff like  that   __label__1
{C so. } # - __label__0
my parents took me  when I was probably somewhere between Ashley and Jamie's age <<voices begin to fade>>.  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{C And } the other schools were built back in maybe the  fifties or early sixties   __label__39
I, {F uh, } -  __label__40
{C And, so } we'll go to a lake   [ and, + ] {F uh, } <throat_clearing>  where they can go do that.  __label__39
[ I have to, + I have to ]  agree with you.   __label__39
[ [ [ That's, + that's, ] + that's, ] + <dishes> that's ] very good.   __label__13
Like, {F uh, } <throat_clearing> perhaps, {F uh, } he has, {F uh, } __label__39
{C so } that lets you be available three days during the week, __label__39
{C or, } - __label__0
Right.  __label__11
-- lonesome on a holiday, {F huh? }  __label__1
{F Uh, } {C so. } - __label__0
Yes,   __label__11
{D well } you can possess 'em here too   __label__39
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] it depends on the country, {D you know, }   __label__40
Most of them.  __label__1
I kind of have to, <noise> -  __label__0
People do seem to travel more.   __label__40
Yeah <laughter>.   __label__1
{F Um, } {C and, } {F uh, } I do toning a lot and, {F uh, } some, -  __label__39
That's the only thing they broadcast   __label__39

Yeah.  __label__11
-- have children -- __label__1
-- {C and } ] I think, too, noticing the kids,  that the fourth and fifth graders, which is what my son is -- __label__1
{C So } [ that, + that ] was pretty scary.   __label__39
are there tornadoes in Colorado, yes or  n-, I don't, - __label__37
Yeah.  __label__11
We had them in the warehouse,  __label__39
{F Uh, } shut my other radio off here <noise>.  __label__4
a lot  [ and, + because ] we're both were from the Richardson, North Dallas area, up until fairly recently.   __label__1

{D So, }  - __label__0
Early June.  __label__39

I've been real pleased, knock on wood.   __label__1
<Laughter>. __label__43
That's right,   __label__7
-- which are in Bayfield which is a wonderful place.   __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D well, } right now, as a matter of fact I'm fixing to go play tennis.   __label__39
# Yeah,   __label__11
{C but } I just had it all over my hands,   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
Right.  __label__7
right.  __label__11
-- that's one part I watch because [ of, + ] {F uh, } I go surfing down here   __label__39
[ {C so, } + __label__40
I'm not sure, {F um, } what exactly is wrong with her.   __label__25
I love Nolan Ryan.   __label__39

there's just, -  __label__0
{D Well, } {F uh, } I live in Garland   __label__39
# Yeah. #  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
# {F Oh, } okay.   __label__18
# {C and } # people just go in there and just pig out and  everything.   __label__39

<laughter>, # {C so } # -- __label__0
People don't want to go out # to vote. #  __label__40
Is that right?  __label__17
a little bit, {D yeah } <noise>.  __label__39
-- cannot do that.  __label__1
{C but } when I was employed with the school district, I didn't have maternity leave either   __label__39
Don't they pro-, - __label__37
{C But } it turns out that, {F uh, } Foster actually, {F uh, } ghost wrote it for him.  __label__39
{C but } [ I, + I ] try to play, <laughter>.  __label__39
{D Well, } I was watching a show about this   the other night   __label__39

About the lowest I've seen gasoline  in the Dallas area is, {F uh, } I guess, about ninety-two point nine now.  __label__39
he's from Indiana,  __label__4
God knows why we hold it on Tuesdays.   __label__32
I think most people are aware, at least now, common knowledge is that <TV> <noise>, - __label__40
In this country, it seems like it's a continuous ongoing campaign.  __label__40
{E I mean, } [ if, + if ] they're not interested fine.   __label__39
Oh.   __label__11
{D well, } our, -  __label__0
<Smack> Are you really?  __label__17
What do you mean fifty-five?   __label__35
{C and, } - __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
It's just, when you, -  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{D Well, } {F um. } - __label__0
{C But, } {F uh, } - __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
[ {C An, } + [ it, + ] {C an } ] I feel bad for the policeman, __label__40
# [ {C or, } + {C or }  ] what we've got, # -  __label__0
{C And } we just went to, {F uh, } two islands.  __label__39
and then she's saying, you know,  you can't let them outside   __label__39
I know my mom and {D like } other ladies, they complain because they think that, {F um, } the women now are too busy with their own personal life and career that they really don't have time for their kids.  __label__39
Nebraska?  __label__3
{C and, }  {F uh, } <static> they just  published this internally, {D you know, } getting people involved.  __label__39
Yes,   __label__31
uh-huh.   __label__11
Right.  __label__11
I agree.  __label__7
No,   __label__7
{C But } then again each state sets its own   __label__39
That's right.   __label__7
{C but } <laughter>, the likelihood  (( certainly ))   (( tilts it )) .  __label__40
# {C and } # it was the van that I needed then, to buy the, {D you know, } -  __label__39
and you can go home and put your #feet up and watch soap operas,#  __label__5
-- get [ wh-, + ] {D like } one of  [ the talk stations, +  the news stations? ]  __label__1
{C and } the first thing I caught  was a sand shark, which was probably a foot, __label__39
The scrambles are fun.  __label__40
that's right,   __label__7
{D see } we really don't see [ the, + __label__40
Yeah,   __label__11
{C and } I know he's  being a little hardnosed about it   __label__39
Pork barrel politics.  __label__16
it is.   __label__7
[ and, + and ] living.  __label__1
-- that's just ] <throat_clearing>, - __label__1
{C And, } {F uh, } maybe not so much that we sit on the back burners   __label__40
Yeah,   __label__11
that explains it doesn't it.  __label__37
{F Uh, } Purdue.  __label__39
# Uh-huh. #   __label__11
just because your going out of the house for so many hours a day doesn't, uh, make those other things go away   __label__40
That's public.  __label__39
{D Well } {C so, } - __label__0
No.  __label__29
<Laughter>. __label__43
-- that [ have, + really have  ] to master skills.   __label__1
{C and } I don't care about comfort.   __label__39
{D see, } it was just different areas,  __label__39
{C And, }  [ their, +  their ] fruits are always exceptional.   __label__39
{C and } [ that's, + that's ] probably one of the stranger things, when you see the air inversions, __label__39
Now we can put all our yard clippings out.  __label__39
{C And } they wrapped a fictional story around it.  __label__39
I have done something, {F uh, } like that, too,  only not nearly as extensive.  __label__39
maybe you're right.   __label__40
Yeah.  __label__31
Yeah,   __label__7
Huh-uh.  __label__11
I don't know.   __label__25
{C but, } {F um, }  [ I, +  I ] just got totally disgusted,   __label__39
-- {C and } it takes people with total and complete dedication who really don't want to make a living for themselves -- __label__40
Exactly.  __label__1
Sure.  __label__11
<Laughter>. __label__43
yeah,   __label__7
[ It's, + it's ] a pretty small little town.  __label__39
Oh.  __label__11
I've heard a lot of people like them.   __label__39
It's really weird.   __label__40
{D Well, } [ I guess, + {D you know, } [ I, + I ] guess ] I can see it from several different perspectives,   __label__25
{D you know, }   __label__1
Why not pay industry a little more, __label__32
[ I, + I ] crocheted when I was  younger.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
-- {D so, } {F um, } what about your wife,   __label__33
Right.   __label__7
{C and } it's just, {F uh, } -  __label__0
it has to be even, {F uh, } magnified [ to + to  ] attract people's attention.  I guess, __label__40
{C And } I'm sure I'll be like that, too.  __label__39
Yeah,   __label__7
[  I, + I ] can probably go on,   __label__22
{D Well, } I teach in the suburb of Dallas   __label__1
Yes.  __label__7
{C But, }  {F uh, } I don't know,   __label__25
((That's)) hard.  __label__40
Yeah,   __label__11
# Oh.  #  __label__11
{C And } little kids can just, {D you know, } maul all over her,  __label__39
-- {F uh, } getting close to the teenage years.   __label__1
{F Um. }  __label__11
{C And } that's for the mandatory portion of the insurance.  __label__39
if I was a cop I would be, - __label__39
{C and } that still goes on.  __label__40
# Yes. #  __label__11
{C So } they're rather have him, except that he gets in trouble all the time and falls off the wagon, [ [ and, + and, ] + and ] have some chance of him playing, {D you know, } earning his money.  __label__39
{C So } [ they hold their, +  you take care of them <noise>, they hold their ] value real well.  __label__39
{C But, } really, [ [ [ [ I'm, + I happy, ] + I, ] + I, ] + {D well } I'm ] curious how other people live.   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
not a real lot,   __label__39
{C And } you rotate it one time.  __label__8
Yeah.  __label__11
[  # I wish, + I wish ] we had something. #  __label__39
It's a pier beam house.  __label__39
# a big, +  # that's a big ] thing with me.   __label__1
-- {C so } a judge, you're right, should have the whole dossier of the criminal <laughter> -- __label__40
I have a sister-in-law who runs a nursing home,   __label__39
We haven't had to look very carefully for child care.  __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
-- the truth that's brought out is, {F uh, } as I say,  when I've heard about, {D you know, } -  __label__1
{C And } I ] still have this  (( slice )) ,  __label__1
with the American Express card from T I, __label__39
{C and }  [ I was, + I was ] an administrator,   __label__39
<Meow> Yeah.  __label__11
was she like a group that was doing it,  __label__37
{D Well, } it was nice talking to you.  __label__22
You don't go out when it's twenty some odd degrees, __label__40
I think the appeal process takes too long.  __label__40
{C but } you're not bothering to cover the things that are interesting to us.  __label__5
{D You know, } I was not going to try to pick  and go somewhere else -- __label__39
{C and } I also like just some strange movies.   __label__39
{C And } they, __label__39
I was just thinking, __label__39
{D You know, } so that, {D you know, } -  __label__1
-- to keep somebody alive who I, in my mind shouldn't be there in the first place and is never going to be a valuable or worthwhile part of society,   __label__1
I think one of the other things that [ concern, + ] has concerned me a little bit, -  __label__40
[ Did you, +  did you ] sue him under the civil system?  __label__37
{C And, } {F uh, } then  I had to do some volunteer work here in Tyler, Texas   __label__39
It was a divorce situation of my parents.  __label__39
# Bye-bye. #  __label__22
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yeah.   __label__11
They have a, uh, lake cabin   __label__39
{D Well, } [ how, +  how ] do you use your credit card?   __label__35
{F Oh, } yeah,   __label__11
{F Huh. }  __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
Don't be indebted to anybody.   __label__40
{C but } I do enjoy watching -- __label__39
{C And, }  {F uh, } that, basically, is the extent to which [ our, + our ] family has been directly, {D you know, }   __label__39
Okay.   __label__14
<Laughter>  What kind of a car do you have now?  __label__35
-- {C but, } {F uh, } {D you know, }  it's like, I can only express myself so much,   __label__39
{C and } when it came to my turn the folks said no we're not going through that again,   __label__39
[ It, +  no, it ] really was extremely warm.   __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
{C So, } that's what we're not used to <laughter>.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yeah <breathing>.   __label__31
{D well } that would be technically illegal,   __label__39
{D Well, } we are, though <laughter>.  __label__22
{F Oh, } gee.  __label__13
{F Oh } no,   __label__13
[ I was, + {F uh, } I was ] so impressed with that movie   __label__39
July.  __label__1
I know when my friend's mother-in-law first went in, {E I mean, } very antisocial.   __label__39
{F Oh, } {F uh, } my brother's in Austin.   __label__39
{D Yeah, }  compared to some of the other ones.  __label__1
# Uh-huh.  #  __label__11
Next to every window the state seems to have put up a turnstile.   __label__39
I guess so,   __label__7
They are very spacious.   __label__39
the teams that  were there last year were, <<pause>> {D see, } somebody from California,   __label__39
{F Um, } I played the accordion for seven years --  __label__39
Uh-huh,   __label__11
Yeah,   __label__7
Yeah.  __label__11
{F Oh, } do you, {D well, } great.  __label__13
the judge was being especially careful that everything was done correctly so there couldn't be [ a, + a ] mistrial of any kind.  __label__39
They have a huge yard and a huge house,   __label__39
# <Laughter>. # __label__43
yeah.  __label__0
{D see } men are coming into their own -- __label__40
-- # this year, # which was no fun.  __label__1
{C but } now we're not quite so  much since the kids are involved so much in sports.  __label__39
Here in Saskatoon at least, the majority of central, {F uh, } -  __label__39
yeah.   __label__11
{F uh, } in their cash drawer. - __label__1
That's right.    __label__7
[ that, + that ] we're getting now.   __label__1
{E I mean } how were they toward, -  __label__33
Four and five.   __label__12
All right.  __label__0
That, - __label__0
Bye-bye.  __label__22
Oh.   __label__11
# kind # of secluded, {D you know, }  __label__1
[ I, + I ] agree --  __label__7
Yeah,   __label__11
maybe in the backyard,   __label__0
I have just started baking,   __label__39
my husband's into, {F uh, } computers.  __label__39
{C so } I learned a lot about them.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
It was tough,   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F uh, } sometimes, - __label__0
he's,   __label__0
Yeah.  __label__11
{C but }  <breathing> my boss wouldn't pay for it,  __label__39
{C but, }  {F um, } I was real happy to see them get knocked off.   __label__39
# and # had gone into nursing homes   __label__1
{C So, } [ I don't, + I don't ] know if you're familiar  with him or not.  __label__38
# Right. #  __label__7
we have too, #  __label__39
Yeah   __label__7
I know,   __label__7
{F Oh, } that must be nice.  __label__13
# That's right,   __label__7
{C and, } {D you know, } it got up like  to couple of hundred dollars,   __label__39
{C But } when the time comes, {F um, } [ she, + and she ]  can't do things   __label__39
[ {C And, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } they ... - __label__0
# It's # going to be a great series.  __label__40
{F Oh, } what, -  __label__0
Huh.  __label__11
That sounds real good.  __label__13
{E I mean, } __label__25
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Saturns, you can't go to a dealer unless you go to [ a, + a ] Saturn dealer. __label__39
In fact, I remember getting my first MasterCard,   __label__39
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] on, {D you know, } the factory fittings, # {D you know, } the factory, {F uh } # -- __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
The hostile planet, I think, __label__40
tell me  __label__1
{C Because } if you look at most corporations, there isn't a woman, {D you know, } that's on the board of directors, or that type of thing,   __label__40
we   got into the fitness center at Methodist   __label__39
No,   __label__12
# {C and } # he was going to school at five.  __label__39
Yeah,   __label__7
{C and, } {F uh, } - __label__0
[ Most, + most ] people don't like to talk about money.   __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and, }  {F uh, } [ there's, + {F uh, } there's ] some petting, {D you know, } like, {F uh, } {F uh, } -  __label__39
Two girls.  __label__11
I can, __label__39
{D Well, } [ I, +  I ] tend to  be more methodical I guess.   __label__40
# {D you # know, } I'm always just wanting to paint  [ and, + and ] wallpaper and redo and redo,   __label__1
Um.  __label__11
[ {D Well, } + {F um, } {D well } ] probably the last thing I did was, {F uh, } paint and wallpaper kids room --  __label__39
{C but, } {D you know, } all my children, __label__39
{D Now, }  {D see, } [ I would have never figured  that, + I would have figured that ] to be a lot more than that <laughter> for something that's limited edition.  __label__40
{D You know, } I read a study once,   __label__39
{F Um, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] think we pay too much.    __label__40
I used to do that with my dad.   __label__39
I don't think anyone does, in fact.  __label__40
Did they have a trial by jury for him.  __label__37
[ The, +  the ] thing with Israel and Palestine, I believe that should  be settled between them.   __label__40
-- I think unrestricted immigration, I think,  [ is not, + {F uh, } is not ] best, {F uh. }  __label__1
that's what he's worried about.   The trees, or a bush, because lilac bushes, [ they, +  they  ] grow fast.   __label__39
{C and } if there's nothing physically wrong with you, then you're drafted.   __label__40
{F Um, } {F oh, } it's [ a, + {D like } a ] huge amusement park -- __label__39
kids.   __label__1
Yeah.  __label__11
[ The trucks, + the special five door trucks ] were a little tough in getting because of something to do with the Persian Gulf war --  __label__39
[ We're kind of, + <laughter> we're   really ] independent.  __label__39
# yeah,   __label__11
<Clicking> {D Well, } {F uh, } preferred benefits, {F uh, }   __label__14
# Right. #  __label__11
They pick numbers   __label__39
{D Actually, } it's for school,   __label__39
{F Oh } yeah.  __label__11
# {F Oh } boy, # # that's great. #  __label__13
[ {C but, } + {C but } ]  virtually the rest of the world is.   __label__39
-- of a ] waiting, {D you know, }  two weeks while they checked you out or  something.  __label__1
{C and, } {F uh, }  I think part of our pay is docked # if we're # -- __label__39
Yeah.   __label__11
# {C and } I guess, # no,   __label__39
That's true.  __label__13
it would be unfair,   __label__40
{C And so } they've already shifted the risk.   __label__39
I probably should have kept one.   __label__40
In the Quorum.   __label__39
I'm for it [ in -- + __label__39
{C So } I think that we did come a long way in the sense that [ we are allowed to vote in, + {D you know, } like you say, we're  ] out in the labor force, but I think we've lost something too.  __label__39
{F Um. }  __label__11
{C And } I was a single parent for awhile and worked.  __label__39
-- {C and } it shows the town,   __label__39
{C But, } {F uh, } the problem is that [ so + ] I'm paying state tax even if I don't live here.  __label__39
Right <throat_clearing>.  __label__11
# He knew I needed # this   __label__39
# {C And } I was so mad. #  __label__39
We all ] learned that metric   __label__1
Yeah,   __label__7
would be music and stuff   __label__1
{C and then } we just chuck it.  __label__39
Uh-huh  __label__11
Okay,   __label__11
# {D You know, } # basic things like that.  __label__39
Yeah.   __label__11
{F uh } [ the + the ] Brady Bill that's __label__1
<Lipsmack> {C So } you've come to a definite opinion on it now?  __label__38
And CHEERS --  __label__1
Yeah.  __label__11
<Throat_clearing>. __label__43
{F Uh, } that's a good question.   __label__40
# Wow.  #  __label__13
# {C And } I # said that's really irrelevant.   __label__39
That's right.  __label__13
Yes,   __label__31
it was more of a relief -- __label__40
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] like  you said, [ the, + the ] news shows [ that are, + that are ] happening, -  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{C because } when people can't pay,  they end up going to clinics or, {D you know, } to public hospitals, and that kind of thing,   __label__40
{C and } they would rush her to the  hospital and  revive her and just bring her back to the nursing home in a  couple of days.   __label__39
{C and, }  {F uh, } # __label__37
Yeah.  __label__11
{C so } <inhaling> <breathing> you meet the standards,   __label__39
especially, {F uh, } young kids getting out of high school. - __label__40
{C and } it's a brick house,   __label__39
{C so } it, -  __label__0
[ {C And, } + {C and } ]  you ask them why they don't vote,   __label__39
who knows   __label__25
It's what's wrong with families   __label__39
Oh, no!  __label__13
Yeah.   __label__11
No play.  __label__39
Yes.  __label__11
# for the entire thing,   __label__1
Yeah   __label__7
{C So } [ it's a lot, + it's very hard ] on a nonfixed income because I don't know how many days I'm going to be called in and whether I am or not, to try to keep track of finances.  __label__40
Are you in the market for a car recently?  __label__37
I don't think our news could be better.  __label__40
{C because } I have, - __label__0
Right.   __label__11
I know,   __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
[ It's not, + it's not  ] that cold, really.  __label__39
Sure.  __label__7
kind of what started it.  __label__1
That's right.  __label__7
# [ I, # +  {F uh } -- __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
and ] new equipment that's come out and so forth.   __label__1
# Yeah. #  __label__11
Which I hate because we don't like to use a lot of the chemicals  and,  because, {D like, } we have a dog [ and, + and,  ] {D you know, } he's going to be out in the yard and who knows who he eats out there.  __label__1
I do too,   __label__7
No,   __label__29
{C But } I would have really liked to go on, {F uh, } secondary ed with math education,   __label__39
# Uh-huh. #  __label__11
{D gosh, } you can ride a bike <laughter> practically all the way to Southern Virginia -- __label__39
{C and } I guess that I thought was a real good acting and writing job both, {D you know, } [ because I think, + ] or directing job.   __label__40
it seems anymore, {F uh, } a movie can not be considered good unless there's just [  some, + some ] sort of violence, __label__40
{C and, } - __label__0
{C so } we get a bit of a relief.  __label__39
<Laughter> He's got to go to a lot of trouble.  __label__2
That's what I'm saying, {D you know, }   __label__39
{C so. } - __label__0
very much so.   __label__7
yep,   __label__7
I have a cat now.   __label__39
I got you.  __label__13
-- for a whole meal, {D you know -- } __label__1
all of them   __label__1
{C and, } # - __label__0
[ {D well } that's, + {D well } that's ] funny.   __label__13
Good.  __label__11
yeah.  __label__31
-- {C and } it's just, you never know who is out there.  __label__39
that reminds me, Federal Express was around ten years ago,   __label__39
{C but } I just thought that was grand.    __label__39
now there have been worse summers.   __label__40
That is the best part of it.  __label__40
that's probably very useful.  __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
The turnover,   __label__2
{C and then } we rented a car for two weeks   __label__39
The engine itself was mostly metric because it came from Canada.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
materials to.   __label__1
{C But, } {F uh, } they have T V -s in the break areas --  __label__39
{C And } get away without embarrassing yourself,   __label__16
he, {D you know, } -  __label__0
I think that's true   __label__40
{C but } [ that's, +  that's ] basically what we do is the gourmet,  __label__39
{C and } [ they, + they ] read well,   __label__39
{C But } [ I don't know, +  I don't know ]  if I'm going to go, -  __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
yeah.  __label__0
None of the Yankees wanted to listen to their kind of luted grammar <laughter>.  __label__40
Yeah.  __label__11
Yeah,  __label__7
The U S would claim that they would have not given them to them.  __label__40
{C but } she took them all down to that Dallas Shelter place.  __label__39
uh-huh,   __label__31
you don't want those,   __label__5
Yeah.   __label__11
{D You know, } that kind of a thing.    __label__14
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Right,   __label__11
{C But, }  that's the only sensible thing to do, is recycle and  reuse the fuel and not store it down in the ground.  As far as I'm concerned, where it could eventually, perhaps, there's some problem, {F uh, } pollute the groundwater.   __label__40
That's certainly, __label__40
-- like knitting or, - __label__1
thank you.   __label__24
{C But, } {F uh, } {D you know, } [ I, + I ] think of my family.   __label__39
I guess the, {F uh, } biggest thing I [ f-, + find ] is the financial -- __label__40
and, {F uh, } I was reading DUNE. __label__1
is that mostly, {F uh, } fly fishing when you're doing that   __label__37
if you ] raise them right, {D you know, } you don't have to worry about the litter box thing, where with dogs you really do have to let them out and take them for walks and -- __label__1
Uh-huh.   __label__11
Yeah,   __label__7
{D like, } -  __label__0
That's all the bigger they get,   __label__39
{F Uh, } perhaps not in the manner that we do it   __label__40
I did start a college fund.   __label__39
# {C But } I, -  __label__0
Uh-huh.   __label__31
bye.  __label__22
{D Well, } on this subject,  I really hadn't had to deal with putting someone in there yet,   __label__39
I'd be interested to see if we do that.   __label__40
[ It's, +  {D you know, } it's ] kind of funny,   __label__40
but it's the whole atmosphere of playing, {F uh, } of going to a game.   *[[slash error]] __label__40
There's, -  __label__0
I have a question to ask you about gardening though.   __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
I don't like to have to have to pull grass --  __label__39
{C and. } - __label__0
{F Uh, } yeah,   __label__31
Major amount here, a major amount # there. #  __label__39
{C and so } it's just a big chunk of money   __label__39
Which is a good deal.  __label__40
as a fit person <breathing>.  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
<Talking> Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C And } she still likes to get TIME -- __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yeah.   __label__11
{C So, }  it provides other means other than just strict, {F uh, } {D you know, } computations and so on,   __label__39
{C So, }  {F uh, } I think T I, [ we spend, + ] of all the major  semiconductor firms, we probably put safety and environmental on the utmost,  foremost, {F uh, } {F uh, } first thing we always look at.    __label__39
-- # and sleep on it. #   __label__1
{C and } I think this is happening some  around the country in terms of, {F um, } morals, trying to teach the kinds of things [ that, + that ] aren't getting taught at home, [ [ and, + {F uh, } and, ] + and ]  respect for other people.   __label__40
<Noise>. __label__43
Um, all right.   __label__14
{C So, }  there could be a lot of things that they could put, {D you know, } that chemical wise that they use to, {F uh, } that they are testing with, __label__40
{C and } we went and  saw THE RESCUERS DOWN UNDER, [ Under, + __label__39
{F Oh } God,   __label__13
{C but, }  {F uh, } - __label__0
That's right.   __label__7
we've heard about that one,   __label__39
Maybe there should be more than twelve people <laughter>.   __label__40
only the guns were in the hands of the criminals,   __label__40
Yeah.  __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
I, I'm in, {F uh, } {D well } -  __label__39
{C But } I am in favor of it for criminal cases #   __label__40
# Uh-huh. #  __label__11

right. #    __label__11
<<Very faint>> Yeah.  __label__11
Standard, we usually don't.   __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
We, __label__39
{C and } we couldn't go get it sooner because I just had the baby,   __label__39
{C and, }  {F uh, } not everyone votes at the same place.  __label__40
{C And, } {F uh, } {F uh, } I've had thirteen hundred dollar bid   and [ I, + ]   as low as five hundred and forty dollars   __label__39

it had large, {F uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, } <lipsmack> press release.  __label__39
-- {C but } he says it's not much when you stretch it over seven foot one.  __label__39
{F Oh, } uh-huh,   __label__11
have into what that whole system is going to look like. Because [ that is, + that is ] our choice now too.   __label__1
-- {C and } each one of them take their turn.  __label__39
<Laughter> Oh.  __label__11
# {C But } then that way # -- __label__39
I think, most of  the major changes for adult women were going on, __label__39
{E I mean, } {D you know, } cost wise [ and -- + __label__40
My advice [ is -- + __label__39
{C Because } I know the town that I come from [ [ the, + the, ] + {F uh, } the ] large I B M plant has something to do with the top rated high school because of their tax base for one   __label__39
{C so } tell them, you've got five years. __label__40
{D well, } {D you know, } he was rear  admiral, whatever, {D you know, }   __label__39
Right,  __label__11
I may drive it until it's dead   __label__39
Uh-huh.   __label__11
do you get to pick the subject   __label__22
# Uh-huh.  #  __label__11
uh-huh.  __label__11
that's what [ they've, + they've ] talked about it.  __label__39
I would agree with you.   __label__7
we s-, - __label__0
{C And } maybe they should be a little more,  {F uh, } {F uh, } concerned with paying the right people to teach [ and, + and ]  be, {F uh, } satisfied with maybe a little older school.  __label__40
{C And } that has really slowed down the forward progress of going to movies.   __label__39
{F uh, } {D you know, } teaching ] classes -- __label__1
# Yeah, #  __label__7
speaking for this area of the country.  __label__1
we watch C N N in morning while we're getting ready -- __label__39
I just kind of sew for my kids   __label__39
yeah.  __label__31
I don't do drugs anyway.   __label__39
Right.  __label__11
{C But } [ only, + only ] one is really {D like } <noise> in the flower bed part   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
Okay.  __label__18
{F Oh, } gosh.  __label__13
Uh-huh.   __label__11
I think that's true.  __label__7
{C But } [ this one is basically, + it is ] like a normal pie crust.  __label__39
{E I mean, } you can't make it everybody.  __label__40
{C Because } if you look at economics  across this country and statistics on who has the money and who the  decreasing, {F uh, } middle class in this country -- __label__40
you ever go by Lucky Computer there?  __label__38
-- as a ] hobbyist versus when you want to go out and buy a blender because you need to mix things.  __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C but. } - __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__31
{C and, } - __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
-- to the men at all.  __label__1
Our first car was an Oldsmobile back in seventy-seven.   __label__39
{C and } [ it's, +  if you keep up with movies, it's ] kind of interesting.   __label__40
{C So, } [ it, + it  ] is like dance,   __label__40
{C so. } - __label__0
So you're just the opposite from me.   __label__40
{C And } even if I knew how to teach the  subject matter, I don't know if I'd know how to handle that kind of [ a, + a ] group of kids.  __label__40
{F uh, } it's ] five seventy up here.  __label__1
{C but, } {F uh, } it was nice.   __label__40
{C and } they usually do a lot of satire --  __label__39
Exactly correct.   __label__7
Really?  __label__17
<Laughter> I love those movies.  __label__39
azaleas grow all over,   __label__39
Right.  __label__11
Okay.  __label__11
<Clicking>. __label__43
I've, {F uh, } {F oh, } -  __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
she was charged with murder <ringing>   __label__39
I guess a friend of mine had a, {F uh, } {D well, } -  __label__39
[ it, + it's, ] as much as you want, {D you know } torn up -- __label__39
[ Are they, + are those ] two married?  __label__37
[ I won't make, +   I won't have ] a sharp cheddar because [ it, +  for fondue I think it ]  should be a little calmer than real sharp, __label__39
{F Oh, } okay.  __label__11
# Yeah. #  __label__11
{C And } I worked in a first grade  classroom for one full semester --  __label__39
{F Uh, } it's a lot different [ in I-, + [ than, + in Iowa ] than ] # it is here. #  __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
it's, {F uh, } {D you know, } new to learn [ some, + ] what different people eat,   __label__22
Yeah,   __label__31
{C and, } - __label__0
{D actually, } no.   __label__29
{F Oh, } that sounds pretty neat.  __label__13
#  [ That's,  you did, + that's what you did.  ]  # __label__2
[ they said, + she said ] that this was almost believable   __label__39
Flooding anywhere.   __label__4
{C or, }   [ al-, + also ] last summer I was doing Nautilus   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I don't think I'd know what to  do if it wasn't there, {D you know. }  __label__39
Oh.  __label__11
<laughter>. __label__43
{C and } I didn't feel   like talking about it,   __label__39
# to # give up  ] a hamburger.  __label__1
{D Well, } I'd really like  to know where that money is actually going to go,   __label__39
Yes.   __label__11
[ What, + what ] do you call the dog?  __label__35
You could go through the black market  like you say.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D You know, } people -- __label__39
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and, } ] {F uh, } __label__39
{C but } you also have to think whether it's worthwhile on the individual basis, for example, someone like, {F uh, } Jeffrey Dahlmer,   __label__40
Right.  __label__11
once it starts boiling, [ I just, +  I ] cook it for a good [ seven minutes, + __label__39
We want to see,   __label__5
--  [ then, + then ] you are saying, {D well, } {F uh, }  {D y-y-you __label__1
is it like a kitchenette type apartment where she can fix her own food if she wants to --  __label__37
They can't imagine for anything else.  __label__39
# {D Well, } # the last thing I did completely myself was an outside deck which I was pretty proud of <laughter> <noise>.  __label__39
They don't get a lot of, uh, activity.   __label__39
{C and } finally President Johnson said, {D well, } they're weren't really sure whether it was a dolphin or a torpedo.  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{D see, } we're from Houston {C and } so it's not so hard for people,   __label__39
{F Uh, } there's exceptions to the rule   __label__40
<Throat_clearing>. __label__43
{C But } as far as budgeting is concerned, {D you know, }  we have, {F uh, } some pretty strict guidelines that we go for, {D you know,   __label__39
-- that,   __label__1
{F uh, } {D you know, } I don't really ] feel as though I've a gotten sufficient, {F uh, } {D you know, } dose of news that way.  __label__1
{C and } I, - __label__0
Right.  __label__11
Because I'm used to wearing the little [ whi-, + white ] girl tennis shoes.  __label__1
It was bad,   __label__39
we've been down the parkway a lot,   __label__39
sometimes it makes you wonder.  __label__40
Are you a golfer?   __label__37
I think they were really lucky there,   __label__39
-- they were all {D like, } {F uh, } {D like } six eight and, {F uh, } {D you know, } six ten,   __label__39
the patterns look like they're nineteen sixties style.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
what kind of house do you live in?  __label__35
{C and so }  I travel a lot.  __label__39
{F Um, } {D well, } [ I'm, + I'm ] only twenty-seven years old   __label__4
{C But } [ I never, + I never  ] heard results or anything like that,   __label__39
things like that,   __label__1
I think that's correct.   __label__7
{C So } [ I really, + {F um, } I ] got a lot of, {F uh, } recognition from [ the, + {F uh, } {F uh, } the ] bowling league, I guess.  __label__39
# <Throat_clearing>.  # __label__43
Yeah.  __label__11
I don't know there just seems to be so many clever ways to avoid the real intent of the law by following the letter.  __label__40
keep forgetting how big states are out there sometimes.  __label__39
{F Uh, } we tax business, {F uh, } eight percent,   __label__39
{F Uh, } invasions of privacy.  __label__39
{C and } they said something about how you don't realize even just your small contribution, it seems like a small contribution   __label__39
{C so } there's lot of things I know to look for.  __label__39
I think that a lot of [ the, + the ] H E W services, although they're providing necessary services, have too much fat in them.  __label__40
could come __label__1
# <laughter>, # __label__43
{C But } it's got {D like } a boot,  on the front of the book.  __label__39
{C And } of course there's no hook,   __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
We did,  ]   __label__1
{C so, } - __label__0
{C and } we started doing, {F um, } large quantities of chlorination of water starting around, {F uh, } where we experimented with it in nineteen oh three and nineteen thirteen <noise> most of the major cities had chlorinated water. __label__39
{C so } I finally said, [ we, + ] I want a really solid car.   __label__39
A real light line, real light rig?  __label__37
I know, -  __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F Huh. }  __label__0
{C and } it's very pretty.   __label__39
{C and } [ I've, + I've  ] -- __label__39
I guess he was probably five or six, you know, when he first started playing soccer.  __label__39
Right now we don't have cable.  __label__39
-- {C and, } ]  they made a heck of a threesome   __label__1
Yeah.  __label__11
[ {C and } + -- __label__39
{C and then } it's not really that realistic   __label__40
-- {F uh, } {F uh, } radiator # hose clamps. #  __label__1
Yeah,   __label__7
# More Collie # and Shepherd than Chow,   __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F Uh } there's not a whole lot of mountains here in Texas -- __label__39
{C So } that kind of threw them off.  __label__39
the Renaissance man --  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
<Laughter>. __label__43
She had crocheted a full bedspread.   __label__39
# {F Oh, } yeah. #  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
-- all over the world, like the, - __label__1
Like fabric that's been stiffened.  __label__38
y-, -  __label__0
Nope,   __label__7
{C So, } [ [ I, +  I, ] +  I ]  do think that, we've learned from it,  __label__40
# That's it,   __label__13
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
When he sees it to his advantage.  __label__1
{C and } there were too many little goldfish,   __label__39
{C but } {D you know, }  you ought to get him to [ g-, +  pull ] the weeds.  __label__8
I don't know.   __label__25
Um,   __label__11
Golly  the Golden Retriever's are good dogs too,  __label__40
# I  just can't see it. #  __label__40
it's too bad one of us don't have some knowledge on this,   __label__40
# {F Uh, } marijuana, cocaine # and amphetamines.  __label__39
{D well } I kept getting called up for drunk driving questions,   __label__39
<laughter>  What other types of community service would they be talking about.   __label__35
{C and } it just blew everything off in the middle of the night   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C And } they said, {D well, } we just plan on  spending the rest of our lives just, <laughter>, getting this property developed.  __label__39
I said, [ {D now } what good does thi-, +  {E I mean, } how is this helping? ]   __label__39
{C And } the money they do have, [ they're not, + they do not use ] <<mispronounced>> it wisely.  __label__40
if I had my choice between a company that did testing and a company who didn't -- __label__40
{C So } we've tried to get out once a year and go on a anniversary camp out,   __label__39
{F Oh, } {D well, } do you do cajun cooking?  __label__37
{C and then } in the winter  time it's jeans [ or, + or ] pants.   __label__39
Norman Gear.  __label__39
I usually get them for Christmas gifts [ or, + and ] {D like } when people go,  {D you know, } [ to, + on ] trips or something.  __label__39
Okay.  __label__11
{C but } we never did --  __label__39
it seems to me like there ought to be a means [ of, + of, ] {F um, } not having to take everything before a <child_talking> full court.  {D You know, }   __label__40
Now that's good.   __label__13
I found that real interesting.   __label__39
That could well be.   __label__13
{C and } that was PRESUMED INNOCENT.  __label__39
I think, -  __label__0
Just citing that, {D you know. } - __label__0
# {D Well, } do you think that, # {F uh, } we should  ignore it and just allowed him to go ahead and, {F uh, } __label__37
-- I would say.  __label__25
{C and } they're long here too.  __label__39
[ I, + {D you know, } I'm ] a guy that plays, -  __label__39
{F Oh, } {D well, } that's nice.  __label__13
yeah.  __label__11
-- sit down and read,   __label__1
{C but } when I think I don't want to do that, {D you know. } -  __label__39
{C and } the switchboard's been down for several days,   __label__39
it used to be Jewish, {D you know. }  __label__39
{D We-, } [ just, + just  ] sentencing, not the trial itself.  __label__26
I just heard something [ about moving, + recently, about moving, ] {F um }   __label__39
{C and } he had two acres that he had for his own grazing <laughter>.  __label__39
[ Exac-, + exactly. ]   __label__7
it turned out to be, {F uh, } {F uh, } an invitation.  __label__16
they can that the, -  __label__39
They said it was going to be a physical, {D you know, }   __label__39
-- [ it's, + {F uh, } <laughter> it's ] pretty fun to watch.  __label__1
{D Well } that's interesting.  __label__13
Really.  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__11
That's enough to, {F uh, } do some boating --  __label__40
{C so, } [ he, + he ]  would have a heck, or she would have a heck of a lot of power, {D you know, } if used wrongly.   __label__40
{D Well, } I'm just gullible enough  that I think Bobby Valentine is, {F um, } {F uh, } doing all right #   __label__39
Yeah.   __label__7
{F Um } <lipsmack>.  __label__0
Bye-Bye. #  __label__22
yeah. #  __label__11
{C So } [ what do you, + what kind of  hobbies are you ] in?  __label__35
[ I, +  I, ] -  __label__0
<Laughter>. __label__43
It really and truly does, because to get the feeling -- __label__40
we looked at our budget,  __label__39
That's the first time I'd seen it.   __label__39
The stores around here don't let  you do it too much.  __label__39
Right about after the daffodils?  __label__38
not bad.   __label__23
At thirty-three hundred dollars or  thirty-five hundred dollars I'm paying in taxes,   __label__39
{C And } you mix and match   __label__39
Huh-uh.  __label__11
People must be tired of it or something.  __label__40
Three times a year she's really busy doing certain things -- __label__39
{C And, }  of course, we always read a bedtime story at night,   __label__39
[ we, +  he ] wanted to get into a Mennonite nursing home which is very popular and hard to get into and had {D like } a ten year waiting list --  __label__39
It's the behavioral science part of communication,   __label__39
he keeps her pretty much terrorized to stay in the house,   __label__39
{F Oh, } really?  __label__17
Okay <laughter>.  __label__11
[ [ I, +  I, ] +  I ] guess, in my own, having had the whole three or  four minutes to, {D you know, } give it a great deal of thought, {D you know, } __label__40
{C and } we had x-rays every year,   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
# {C So. } #  I suspect that we'll see a lot of gains from that.  __label__40
{F Oh } that's okay,  __label__15
if she looks ] at it as you suggest [ [ [ that, + that ] + that's, ] + that ] she can give [ her, + [ h-, + ] her ] talent back to the Lord for  His glory -- __label__1
I'm sorry,   __label__21
[ {C and } I've got, + {D yeah, } {C and }  I've got ] a HISTORY OF KINGSLEY, IOWA  __label__39
We are,   __label__39
Uh-huh.   __label__11
I know that it's not settled but, there are other areas that we could focus our attention on.  __label__39
{C But, } {D you know, } same, {F uh, } -  __label__0
[ I don't, +  {D yeah, }  [ I, +  I ]  don't ] think it can happen either.  __label__7
{F Oh, } good.  __label__13
{D So, } {F oh, } well,   __label__11
{C so } trying to get pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts   __label__39
{C and } it's a pain to have to stand there and see what it is before you leave --  __label__40
[ I, + __label__25
{F Uh, } apparently,   __label__26
it's usually beautiful up there isn't it?  __label__37
Are they oaks?  __label__37
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__18
Uh-huh.  __label__11
with a color that's kind of a, {F um, } burgundy and green and yellow and  blue and beige floral design.  __label__1
Yeah,   __label__7
{F Uh, } the budget problems up here [ are, + are ] pretty tense.   __label__39
[ they, +  with the drugs [ they're, + they're  ] ] robbing and killing   __label__39
{F Uh, } {F oh } ninety-seven -- __label__39
<<In a very soft voice>> He does a good job.  __label__39
East of here.   __label__39
# {C and } he's # got a big clientele   __label__39
{F Oh, } are you?  __label__37
That kind of thing.  __label__25
No <laughter>.   __label__7
[ it just + <throat_clearing>, we   just ] moved down here a couple years ago,   __label__39
She's actually at Bible College for this current year.  __label__39
image or something.  __label__1
{C So, } it's like, nothing happened  during the seventies.   __label__39
{D Well, } the other thing I can think of  is, {F uh, } what is still going on in Iraq -- __label__39
{D Well, } # [ I don't, + I don't ] think that, # - __label__39
{F Oh, } I do too.  __label__7
{F Oh, } no <laughter>.  __label__13
{C but. } - __label__0
Well, I guess that's, I guess that's about all I've got to say, __label__39
If they finish before their thirty minutes is up, then they can go out and  play for {D like } maybe five or ten minutes, probably be the most.  __label__39
{C and } they weren't told why.    __label__39
{C and } that's, {D like, } {D you know, } five seconds for the whole play --  __label__40
when I was eleven I went also to the Caribbean.  __label__39
apparently the fuel that they use and the fumes that they produce to deliver, __label__39
[ I just, +  I ] saw on the news the other night that [ the, +  {F uh, } the ] little girl  that used to be the littlest girl on the Cosby show, Kisha Knight Pullman, was starting  a, -  __label__39
{F Oh, } yeah.  __label__11
I know a few people leafing through them at the store -- - __label__39
There we go.   __label__14
{C and } I know people who have been drug tested and who have not, {D you know, } been hired by a corporation which, {F uh, } {D you know, } -  __label__39
<Laughter>  Yeah,   __label__7
Okay.   __label__22
{C and } maybe that's what the public wants,   __label__40
[ Unless, + I guess, if ] you request one you can.   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__31
Right.  __label__11
she could care less about that.  __label__39
{F um, } because of all the layoffs and everything <laughter>   __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
[ they -- + __label__39
{F Um. }  __label__0
Uh-huh,   __label__11
Yeah <breathing>.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Which, after awhile I could, {D you know, } take [ it + ] apart in my sleep if I needed to.  __label__1
{C And } we used to, -  __label__0
[ {C so, } + __label__39
No,   __label__29
# {C but, }  # {F uh, } I remember working on those cars,   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
Okay.  __label__11
{C and } I'm finding in graduate school it's a lot harder, because, {F uh, } I just don't have the time any more to sort of sit in a course, that I'm not getting graded for.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
-- [ on, + on ] the legal system.  __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Kind of gives them the, {D you know, } -  __label__40
{D like } maybe Wednesday night it's George's turn to set all the tables.  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
That's the only one that I, {D you know, } -  __label__39
# Which I # think <noise> they have  to do on rifles and things now too.   __label__40
My mom likes {D like, } {F uh, } Doris Day, {D you know. }  __label__39
{C And } I don't know.  __label__25
<Breathing> That's true <breathing>.   __label__7
I'm in Austin.  __label__39
{C and } I really do watch Baltimore news.   __label__39
<Laughter> {D So } that was it.  __label__16
They're, -  __label__0
I read the WALL STREET JOURNAL,   __label__39
{C and } # -- __label__39
-- to do anything with them.  __label__1
# we are totally # equal now.   __label__40
yeah,   __label__11
{C but } at least we keep our chicken nuggets handy for them <laughter>.  __label__39
-- person <laughter>.   __label__1
Yeah.   __label__1
around them,   __label__1
it's a big change.  __label__39
Oh!  __label__13
uh-huh. #  __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
Yeah.  __label__31
{C and } I said, that's wonderful.   __label__39
then you can go right through.  __label__39
[ they, + they ] gave the guys, {F uh, } the power and the material and  [ the, + ] told them to go do it and they did it.  {D You know, } __label__40
and, {F uh, } park [ out there, + {D you know, } way out there ] in the boondocks.  __label__1
Right <laughter>.  __label__11
{C and } [ even if the, + even ] at the local level, when somebody's assaulted -- __label__37
{C and so, } {F uh, } {D you know, } [ their, + their ]  success rate is very high.   __label__40
# Uh-huh. #  __label__11
At one time I had a fairly regular exercise program.   __label__39
{F Um, } I'm not really, {F uh, } sure that I even understand why the administration  is proposing, for instance, tax reductions, because it seems to me that  [ [ if, + if, ] + if ] they're talking about reducing, {F uh, } the tax that needs to be paid,  or the tax that's currently being paid, then [ that can't, + it seems to me it can't ]  possibly, {D you know, } help with [ the, + the ] deficit picture.  __label__39
{C and, }  {F uh } -- __label__39
[ I don't, + I don't, ] {F uh. } - __label__0
I'll bet,   __label__13
{E I mean, } [ what's, +  what good is ]  that?   __label__32
They'll let us know <laughter>.  __label__38
# Uh-huh. #  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__7
# that # was one of the places I had checked out.   __label__1
{C And } they'd have to change that little ruler  that's on the door of the seven eleven that, __label__40
{F Oh, } no.  __label__11
-- he does what he needs to,   __label__39
{C and } I don't have a choice any more --  __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
<laughter>, all of her animals that she ever had were adopted.  __label__39
No,   __label__29
{C but } I think it's very unlikely we'll have a family reunion, {D you know. }  __label__39
I guess that's a hobby.  __label__39
{C or }  ((   )) -  __label__0
{F Oh, } okay.  __label__18
pardon me?  __label__11
{C but } I don't see going on a camping trip probably until next summer.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Right.  __label__11
Okay.  __label__18
{F Oh, } Okay.   __label__18
{C and }  it's about one by one and a half foot wide and long.  __label__39
{C and, } {D you know, } it was just hysterical.  __label__40
I've got two boys, {F uh, } one four year old  {C and } one two years old,   __label__39
a machinist has a huge number of dollars invested in tooling.   __label__40
Yes,   __label__7
{D see, } {C and } I wish I could go fishing here because I don't really know much about the fishing here.   __label__39
Yeah   __label__11
{F Oh, } yeah.  __label__18
Yeah.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C And } my mom always liked that kind of stuff.   __label__39
{C and } every other day they do your recycling trash.  __label__39
You think so?  __label__17
Like the fifties oldies, or older oldies?  __label__37
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I don't think you can.   __label__40
{D You know, } go to a store,  they normally have these exercise, things, these A B C -s of physical fitness on them.   __label__1
{C But, }  {F um, } __label__39
{C And } I haven't figured how to get that soft,   __label__39
I did, too.  __label__39
# {F Oh } sure. #   __label__7
I like mysteries.  __label__39
{C And } everybody up there looks pleased with themselves when they're taking their stuff in like they're doing something good to, __label__39
Do you?   __label__17
{C and } [ e-, + I ] work for Texas Instruments.  __label__39
<Breathing> {F Oh, } {F oh, } {F oh, }  {F uh, } I think I know where, {F uh, } Lake Caddo, or  something like that.  __label__40
{C And, } {F uh, } he left it in the middle of the pond <pounding>.   __label__39
-- {D you know, }   __label__1
basically  it says here buy me and go rob a seven eleven  __label__40
-- {C but } [ it's, + it's ] very serious -- __label__39
there's a guy at this particular one I go to, __label__39
{C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } who would have cared about earth?   __label__32
{C And } whenever there's that kind of subjective judgment, there's always going to be a dispute -- __label__40
{C but }  that has a little bit to do with some of the things that I read  <throat_clearing>.  __label__39
we do some of that,  __label__39
kind of nationalized it -- __label__40
Uh huh  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__7
I think the problem is that the [ doctor v-, + doctors ] have conspired to limit the number of doctors, and that the lawyers have conspired to make sure that if you are a doctor, you are going to pay high premiums [ on your h-, + {F uh, } [ unemp-, + ] {E I mean, } on your ] liability.  __label__26
Uh-huh.  __label__11
speaking of noise, you can probably hear my little. - __label__38
-- on [ a, + {F oh, } a ] fairly regular basis, __label__1
That's true.  __label__7
the things that we kind of looked at [ is, + is ] you want to see how many teachers you have. __label__39
-- whether, {D you know, } [ they're, + they're ] selling school.  __label__1
{C And } they got her going again.  __label__39
yeah.  __label__11
{C And } presently we have quite a few frequent flyer miles --  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C But } [ they, + {F uh, } I  think they ] should   __label__39
{C and, }  if I'd of probably had three or four children, I don't see how we could have made it, {D you know, } without me working.  __label__39
# Yeah. #  __label__11
{C but } I think the city one could possibly look into that or something.  __label__40
Yeah,   __label__11
they, -  __label__0
# Yeah. #  __label__11
uh-huh.  __label__31
-- {C or } do you send them away to boarding school  __label__5
[ {C and, } + {C and }  ] [ we put + ((   )) , we fill  ] it with lights  and -- __label__39
{D well, } probably what [ y-, + ] Arizona used to be like, {D you know, } __label__39
# Yeah,   __label__7
we had a drought --  __label__39
yeah <laughter>.   __label__7
Himself and her?  __label__37
It was like, this is the last year you can put  your punch cards in and get your program out   __label__39
{F Uh, } {D you know, } I sort of can't get enough of this.  __label__39
{E I mean, } it's got to have those  things, otherwise, I don't care.  __label__39
{F Oh, } you just, - __label__39
I don't, -  __label__39
{C And, }  {F uh, } when I seen some of my friends that  have taken that six week old baby, {D you know, } to someone else, it's just, I can imagine how emotional  it must be. [ [ And, + and, ] + ] {D you know, } multiplied by the fact that you don't really trust the person  or you're uncomfortable with the situation  ((   )) , as far as child care, {F um, }   __label__39
It was a tragic mistake,  __label__40
Yeah,  __label__11
# What about you? #  __label__33
Right.  __label__11
Yeah.   __label__11
{F Oh, } dear.  __label__13
{C But, } {F uh, } I haven't done that <laughter> <sniffing>.  __label__39
Course I don't know whether I want to go to Bulverde or not, {D you know } -- __label__40
I really enjoy it there.  The landscaping, the homes, the architecture, the whole thing -- __label__39
{C But, } the here, I just get a kick out of, {F uh, } -  __label__39
{C so } -- __label__39
{F Oh, } {D really, } [ I ne-, + I ] hadn't actually known that.  __label__39
<Noise>. __label__43
yeah,   __label__31
I rea-, -  __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C And } that has a direct impact on a lot of things that we really can't do down here on earth including, {F uh, } some new pharmaceutical techniques.  __label__40
do it again.  __label__1
{C and } [ he said, +  he said ] Mom, all we do is work.  __label__39
{C and. } - __label__0
they'll get it across the border one way or the other.  __label__40
{F Um, } I'd say in today's economy, besides basic benefits, {F uh, } such as, {F um, } health insurance and life insurance and [ the, + ] some type of retirement plan -- __label__40
you make your meat real, {F uh, } thin, {D you know, } bite-size pieces.  __label__39
{C and } we go quite often, __label__39
{C So } [ that's, +  that's ] a very good  place to eat, The Blue Mesa Grill.  __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
{D So } she would just substitute once or twice a week, {D you know, } just for that little extra money when we were in school.   __label__39
-- than applied.  __label__1
{D Well } I go to Saint Louis from  time to time   __label__39
that one is definitely worth seeing,   __label__39
[ What, +  what's ] my motivation?  __label__19
[ I, + I ] didn't like, {F uh, } -  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
[ The petroleum pretty much, + {E I mean, } those petroleum products ] I think are [ the big, + {F uh, } {E you know } -- __label__40
Kathy and Kevin Guy.  __label__39
-- it's too, -  __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and, } {F uh, } you can get everything here  from, {F um, } a very spicy Indian meal to, {D you know, } the favorite barbecue  [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } just anything your little hearts desires around here,   __label__39
{C And, }  {F uh, } she just had a terrible time keeping sincerely dedicated people simply because they could not live with a kind of hours and the salary.  __label__39
{E I mean, } it does, __label__40
{C and } we don't, {F uh, } run out and buy a lot [ of, + of ] things either.   __label__39
{F uh, } <lipsmack>, __label__14
my husband was complaining the other day   __label__39
I did too,   __label__7
I have a sister that lives in Dallas,    __label__39
That's great.   __label__13
[ Southwest, + southwest ] side of Houston.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
[ I-, + {C and } ] especially, {F uh, } in Wisconsin and Michigan they say, no, buying of our fish.  __label__39
{D So } thank you for calling.  __label__22
{C So, } we are on a schedule where I try every, {F uh, } three or four years [ to, + to ] buy a new one.    __label__39
{C and } I think, {F uh, }  a lot of it is selfishness.   __label__40
{C and } it was fairly reasonable.    __label__39
{D Well } I think the war ended too soon.  __label__40
right.   __label__7
{D Well, } I guess it depends on if you got something to worry about <throat_clearing>.  __label__40
I'm mainly do a lot of walking.   __label__39
[ I don't really, +  I don't, ] -  __label__0
{F Oh, } yeah?  __label__17
{C and } [ she, +  it ] final just wore out   __label__39
{C But, }  {F uh, }  in fact I didn't eat out that much there because I was traveling by myself in a car,   __label__39
{C So } that's what I've taken to doing lately,   __label__39
they're talking about doing that again, too.  __label__39
<Talking> Especially for handguns,  __label__1
uh-huh.  __label__31
I see.  __label__11
{F Oh, } I don't usually like stuff that continues.   __label__28
{C and, }  {F uh, } he actually, -  __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F Uh, } {C and } it saves a lot time.   __label__39
{C And, } {F uh, } because you never know what's going to happen <laughter>.   __label__39
{D Well } I enjoyed -- __label__22
{C and } I, {F uh, } didn't think that, {F uh, } going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict,   __label__40
Yeah.  __label__11
this child was crying and needed some comfort, {D you know, }  __label__5
ninety-nine percent of ours is newspaper   {C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } {F uh, } glass.  __label__39
# {D Well, } I know # for sure it was,   __label__39
{D Well, } yeah,   __label__11
[ they're, + they're ] bent on, {F uh, } seeing [ how much land, + how much more land ] they can get, and [ how much, + {F uh, } how much ] of the campus they can build up --  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
We've got two bathrooms   __label__39
{C and } she was gone,   __label__39
{E I mean } Sunday dinner was at my grandmother's   __label__39
you're not the only one.  __label__39
{F Oh, } it's, -  __label__0
I'm in a telecommunications company   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I wonder if they ... - __label__0
It was terrible.   __label__39
# Wow. #  __label__13
{F Oh, } {C so } you like to go there for the  holidays   __label__38
I'm ready for it,   __label__22
<Laughter>. __label__43
Yeah,   __label__7
{C and } -- __label__39
Tho-, -  __label__0
it looks like it's come close to that as it is.  __label__40
{C but } [ I don't, + I don't ] know if I'll be able [ to, + to ] do it.  __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
Not really,   __label__39
{C and } the matinee starts before I can get away from work.  __label__39
{C But, } the victim [ [ does not have the right, + does not have the same ] + <barking> -- __label__39
taxes on it.  __label__1
Yeah.   __label__11
Huh-uh.  __label__11
Is that true? <Noise>.  __label__37
-- [ {C and } that, + {C and, } ]  {F uh, } I don't know,   __label__25
# {D Well, } {F uh, } # __label__9
{C and, } the, {F uh, } -  __label__0
# I think # so <breathing>.  __label__39
{C and, } it's usually pretty good,   __label__39
{D Well } it's,  __label__22
{D You know, } [ they, + they ] will allow you to, -  __label__39
{D You know, } that <<pause>> this isn't like walking around and looking for somebody   __label__40
[ that's, + that's ] a high irritant for me.   __label__39
He does that, {F uh, } musically, listens   __label__39
{C And }  [ I, + my ] bathing suit's just one piece,   __label__39
-- action.  __label__1
they don't check how good, -  __label__38
# Yeah. #  __label__11
{F Uh, } <child_talking> I guess the Lord started out with, [ we'll treat you fa-, + I'll treat you fairly ] there as long as you do what I say.   __label__40
Yeah.   __label__11
You got a hundred things going on.   __label__1
We went, {F uh, }   __label__39
{C And } a lot of times you figure, {D you know, }  with the support that they provide, {D you know, } -  __label__40
That's true,   __label__7
they had all these canals up through this one little retirement area,   __label__39
Okay.   __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
# Please come back to work. #  __label__12
if I have, -  __label__0
I like everything he's done so  far.  __label__39
It's right,   __label__13
{C and, } {F uh. } - __label__0
[ {C But, } + {C but } ] it's this  maintaining [ a, +  a ] regular habit that I just can't -- __label__39
{C so } I have concentrated on watching James Bond movies, __label__39
# Uh-huh. #  __label__11
{D Well, } that's great.  __label__13
{C and, } {F uh, } [ they, + they're ] just always, -  __label__0
<lipsmack> [ {D so } then that + {D so } that ] throws out that idea makes it a religious discussion then.   __label__39
-- do they have yarn hair   __label__37
{E I mean, } my husband and  I, -  __label__39
Really.  __label__17
# {C so } # we make, {F uh, } four or five middle eastern dishes that are just all real simple.  __label__39
I've never seen that.  __label__39
I haven't.  __label__39
[ I guess the, + I get the ] WASHINGTON POST --  __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
I just got real good and toned.  __label__39
# {C and } [ I just, + I ] think it's the best thing.   __label__39
No.   __label__29
{D You know, } [ you can, + you can ] still get factory original parts.  __label__39
Yeah.   __label__11
-- {C but } I think that's the way  we need to go.   __label__40
# Uh-huh.  #  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C but, } {F uh, } {F oh, } I guess, I really don't know.  __label__25
-- {C and } we have to pay that price,   __label__40
{C So } I've seen a wide range of both, {D you know, }  nonsalary type benefits and other stuff, {D you know, } like health care that's either  fully or partially paid   __label__39
Yeah.   __label__11
[ they want the, + they want the ] fun part and [ not the, + not the ] work.  __label__39
Ten dollars is for vacation fund whatever.   __label__39
# {F Uh, } it's a ba-, -  __label__0
and that kind of stuff, I will take my friends' kids, __label__1
{F Oh, } uh-huh,   __label__11
{C And } they can't fire you.  __label__39
-- and that kind of stuff,   __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C But } a lot of families do that.   __label__39
I think, I was watching something the other day about that {D actually } on, {F uh, } a news special or something like that   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
I think that was just  [ a, +  a ] horrible miscarriage of justice because of the, {F uh, } {D you know, } staying  by the absolute strict rules and not allowing things to be presented to the jury,  that, {F uh, } were highly irrelevant to the case and could, I thought, have  established the defendant's innocence.  __label__40
Nice to have spoken with you, too.  __label__22
{C So, } unless the kids are asleep I don't [ get, + usually get ] much done either  <laughter>.  __label__39
yeah.   __label__11
<Noise>. __label__43
Uh-huh.   __label__11
this particular community is a Catholic community   __label__39
they still take time,   __label__39
Uh-huh,   __label__7
{C And } [ if, + if ] you have a situation where you change that body of law, then all of sudden [ [ they, + they start, ] + they could start ]  going back and digging up all these cases [ that, + {F uh, } that ] would be handled differently # were # -- __label__40
{C And } that  was something for greedy old me at Christmas time, # I'll tell you. #  __label__39
he works over there   __label__1
{D You know, } [ they, + they ] see most, {F uh, } -  __label__0
it's hard to get, -  __label__40
I did.  __label__39
kind of store,   __label__1
{F Uh, } {D well } my husband's [ kind of the eth-, + [ he, + he's ] the ethnic fan. ]    __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
yeah.  __label__7
<Noise>  # Okay. #  __label__14
# {D Well, } it, {F uh, } -  __label__0
Right,   __label__7
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Do you work at T I?  __label__37
you have to just keep up with everything in the off- season.   __label__40
-- # {C and } you zip through # it quicker.  __label__39
{C And } yeah,   __label__0
{C and } now all my blades need sharpening. __label__39
{C But, } {F uh, } I'm afraid [ I'm, +  I'm ] probably in the minority.   __label__40
[ [ it's, + {F uh, } it's, ] + {F uh, } it's, ] {F uh, } -  __label__0
{C So, } I'd say, __label__39
Okay.  __label__18
What about politics on it?  __label__33
you said, what were you saying you were teaching there?  __label__35
{C And } we're expecting another one tonight.  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{C and } we were getting ready to leave   __label__39
That was unheard of, {D you know, } twenty years ago.  __label__39
{C But } aft-, {F uh, } -  __label__0
-- and my father also,  [ and + {F uh, } or ] have someone go into their home, {D you know } [ and + {F uh, } and ] look [ after + ] them.   __label__1
My husband bought it for me when my daughter was born [ three months, + four months ] ago.  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
College or, - __label__37
{F Uh, } is there someone, -  __label__37
{C And, } {F um, } just, {D you know, } [ it's sha-, + ] many times <baby> you get out of the store faster if you pay with that than if you pay  with cash.   __label__39
That's okay   __label__13
I get the mold [ I put, + I put ] it on, {D you know, } the frosting  (( always ))  melts   __label__1
yeah,   __label__7
{C and } it's really <door> {D you know, } overkill <swallowing>.  __label__40
{C and } it was a little too late for the fish   __label__39
{C and, } {D you know, } what's right -- __label__39
{C and } I have peace of mind, __label__39
Bargello.   __label__39
Okay, {F um, }   __label__14
{C and } it's for recycling   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__4
[ I think, + I think ]  that probably, [ until, +  until ] [ they're really invalids, + {F uh, } the elderly are invalids, ]  I think that they should be able to interact with other people -- __label__40
{D Well, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] think if they went according to, {F uh, } the BIBLE where it does say, __label__40
Me either.  __label__39
With a teaching background I've, {F um, } had a little bit of experience with the child day care  type situations   __label__39
it really does, {D you know. }   __label__7
{F Uh,  } the guy called me,   __label__39
# Does, # __label__37
# Right.  #  __label__11
{C or } [ do you, + do you ] work or what?  __label__34
Yeah,   __label__11
{C but } the things that work in psychology other   the years that they've proven  to work, they just come out of the BIBLE   __label__40
[ I enjoy the, + I enjoy ] working.  __label__39
equipment to, {F uh, } - __label__1
{C and } I think it  will, {F uh, } continue to force us to clean up our act, __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__31
they just, {D you know, } come up,   __label__40
I guess you run into the pollution factor.  __label__40
I know that my late husband was simply indifferent.   __label__39
You got to take the time off <laughter>.  __label__1
But, uh, - __label__0
How important you think that would be.  __label__39
I guess you could say.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
-- {C so } that might be why I look for inexpensive places -- __label__39
During that time period, in other words, __label__39
No <sigh>,  __label__29
This one you had to work with.   __label__39
{C and } they have to travel by boat forty-five minutes to get to their car and stuff,   __label__39
Good.  __label__13
{F Uh, } {D well, } {F uh, } to begin,   __label__0
[ [ I, + I, ] + I'm ] wondering whether  it's going to get to the point where you can't, __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
[ almost thirty, + all over thirty ] percent, isn't it.  __label__37
{F Uh, } those, - __label__0
I think it would be worth it  everybody wo-, - __label__40
great.   __label__1
-- really?  __label__1
in fact this week, they came out with some new math, {F uh, }   __label__39
{C but } they [ were so, + seemed, ] __label__40
{C and } [ I, + I ]  would like to buy more classical tapes and stuff,   __label__39
# Uh-huh.  #  __label__11
{C so. }   I don't know,   __label__25
{F Oh, } okay.  __label__11
{F Uh, } I have a friend when I lived out in the country,   __label__39
Right.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Thank you.  __label__22
# Uh-huh. #  __label__11
-- and sing that again   __label__1
[ it, + it's ] hard to go out when it's this hot.  __label__39
# or # I guess crawl space,  __label__1
I kind of try to judge from day to day.   __label__39
{C And } I [ hope we, + __label__22
Maybe we ought to just start carving in stone again.  __label__8
{F Oh, } I go for that,   __label__7
# V C R, and everything else.  #  __label__40
{D Well, } I live like fourteen hours from home.  __label__39
I don't,   __label__39
<Laughter> I have a girlfriend that every time her son starts taking things for granted she threatens to send him to Mexico with her relatives  and  let him get a taste of that # for a while <laughter>. #  __label__39
probably [ your, +  a great deal of what you ] say  is true about the legals.  __label__1
{D well, } it hasn't been just -  __label__0
{C and } a couple of drug people got into a  fight with a gun   __label__39
-- wrote it.   __label__1
You've got the holy rollers   __label__40
Uh-huh,   __label__11
And these were from other, people from other countries.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and then } the HERALD EXAMINER collapsed about two years ago because of, {F oh, } I don't know, just nobody was buying it really.  __label__39
{C So } [ we, + I ] have sort of a captive audience,   __label__39
Okeydoke,   __label__22
women are starting to have babies without a partner.  __label__1
That's what I'm thinking what your mom and dad always used to say, when you have kids of your own, __label__39
#  ((   )) . # __label__43
{F Oh, } [ like, + like ] Hank Williams.   __label__39
that sounds like a great deal to me <laughter>.   __label__40
That's wh-, -  __label__0
Oh.  __label__11
{C And } I don't know what the solution is.  __label__39
Yes,   __label__31
{C but } I noticed in one of the sales catalogs this weekend they have [ [ a, + {D like } a, ] + a ] clothes hamper kind of thing that, {D you know, } you lay your string in, then you put your papers in there -- __label__39
Uh-huh.    __label__11
yeah.  __label__11
{C and } you just watch it on T V and  see how it just burns your brain completely up, {D you know. }   __label__40
{C and } a lot of my friends went to [ univert-, + University ] of Michigan   __label__39
[ they, + they ] started after we moved down here   __label__39
Were you shocked like, {F oh } {D no, } I'm stuck I need to buy stuff.  __label__37
Yeah,   __label__12
Yeah.  __label__11
{D Well, } yours is probably the same as ours.   __label__40
# I saw the original # BACK TO THE FUTURE   __label__39
{C and } they were doing an overview of Los Angeles, {F uh, } from an area that was up higher   __label__39
Why?  __label__35
{C and, }  {F uh, } we'd been fishing in the canals   __label__39
{C so } hey <laughter>.  __label__13
[ [ it was-, +  it wasn't, ] +  {D you know, } it was never ] -  __label__40
# he's # -- __label__39
-- {D yeah, }  was, -   *[[slash error]] __label__1
-- [ to, + to ] be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick, {D you know, } Joe Blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever -- __label__1
{F Um, } he's doing some other movie,   __label__39
{D well, } that's good, because I didn't like Oklahoma that well <laughter>.  __label__39
# Yeah. #  __label__11
<Noise> # Right. #  __label__11
{C and, } {F uh, } give it a try.   __label__22
{D Well, } yeah,   __label__11
{C and } it will stay relatively well <breathing>.  __label__39
-- rate.  __label__1
in fact we have a  ((   ))  album ... - __label__39
#No.#   __label__7
Uh-huh.  __label__11
[ It's going to take, + <child_talking> {F uh, }  it's going to take ] all of us getting together,   __label__40
{C And } they have just done as much as they  can for that man,   __label__40
No,   __label__10
as far as any maintenance on my car, [ I, + I ] shy away from the oil  changes,   __label__39
My house is on a main road,   __label__39
{C but, } {D you know, } [ if he had the preference, + {E I mean } [ his, + his ] preference ]  is, {F um, } blue jeans and a t-shirt,   __label__39
[  [ the, + the ] first, + {D well } my first ] car was a fifty-six Mustang   __label__39
Uh-huh <laughter>.   __label__11
{F Uh, } [ {C and, } + {C and } ] I just couldn't do that, __label__39
{D Like, } {C so } you're in the marching  band and stuff in high school.  __label__38
Well, I agree with the boredom of the election process,   __label__7
I'm sitting at my desk now with four machines <laughter> in front of me.  __label__39
he didn't want them,   __label__39
# Uh-huh. #  __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
Are you driving?  __label__37
{F Oh, } wow.  __label__13
the kids thought that was wonderful.  __label__39
I, {F uh, } -  __label__0
Yeah.  __label__11
when, {F um, } he does football leagues  and baseball leagues and all kinds of stuff,  __label__1
It was the one where he was a defense, -  __label__39
My, {F uh, } cousin is a F B I agent down in Miami.  __label__39
{C so } [ it's, + it ] has a flatter bottom than a normal wok does.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C so, } [ I, + I ] like, __label__39
[ [ That, + that ] would be, + __label__40
{F Uh, } <sigh> {C but }  it's, {D you know, } -  __label__0
Now are you with T I down there?  __label__37
<Laughter>. __label__43
Yeah <<faint>>.  __label__11
{E I mean, } it's like a bonus to go to jail.  __label__40
Yeah,   __label__7
I said, okay, because I'm not a swimmer.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C And, }  {F um, } I think it would be, -  __label__0
[ I, + I ] just painted.  __label__39
Yeah.   __label__11
{C So, } what kind of cooking do you do up there?  __label__35
{C but, } [ I, + I ] haven't.   __label__39
# <Laughter>.  # __label__43
[ [ have you, +  have, ] +  did ] you  see TEXASVILLE?   __label__37
{D So. } - __label__0
yes.  __label__31
# {F Uh, } {D well, } # - __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
# {C and } they have one at ten. #  __label__39
I've just, -  __label__0
-- {C and } before that, I never owned a home or anything,   __label__39
that makes sense.   __label__13
{C And, } {F uh, } I, -  __label__0
And found that there's, {F uh, }  individual vendors   __label__1
{C but } when it comes to Palestinians,  if they're out in the street at night, [ it's, +  it's ] really looked on as odd.   __label__39
{C and } I am  just in awe to see this,  __label__39
# Yea-, #  __label__11
# and ] # so genuine, __label__1
{C and, } {F uh, } her kids were going to places like  Amherst and B U   __label__39
Make you want to come back.  __label__1
are they really good?  __label__37
I know Dallas is. #  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Okay.   __label__18
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yes.  __label__7
it's on, - __label__0
Yeah <TV>.  __label__7
# Uh-huh. #  __label__11
# the difference.  #  __label__1
{C But } we are not living in that world.  __label__40
# {C or } ] # I am not a big basketball or  baseball fan, [ if it, + unless it's ] baseball, [ if it's some, + if it's ]  a team I really like, I may watch   __label__1
Yeah,   __label__11
<Lipsmack> {F Um, } [ [ e-, + n-, ] + __label__28
You would never think of having to replace the clutch in a Mercedes, __label__40
I don't know about the Vikings <laughter>.  __label__39
Last thing I saw was, {F um, }  I think, {F uh, } SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY with Julia Roberts.  __label__39
I think [ that, + that ] [ if, + if ] there is a problem with the school system, {F uh, } [ from, + ] it's been my perception that the school teachers and school officials are not that well, {F uh, } paid. That perhaps that might be one area [ that, + that ] could be improved.   __label__40
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and, } ] - __label__0
these people are middle class people, just like us.   __label__39
they mixed, {F uh, } a gallon of it   __label__39
The styles,   __label__2
{F Oh } yeah,   __label__7
{C but } we don't give them those <laughter>.  __label__39
Uh-huh.   __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I think it was something like twelve years # or  something. #  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{C But } with windows you can have the  program   __label__39
{D Well, } [ I, + I ] tell you, {F um,  }   __label__4
would not constitute, {F uh, } dismissal or grounds for whatever the company or agency might, {F uh, } have set up for those who genuinely have a problem.  __label__1
It is,   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I was never able to go to Baghdad.   __label__39
Um.    __label__11
after they've been here ten minutes, they have already explored the entire house,   __label__39
a, - __label__0
{C and, } let's face it,   __label__25
had a [ lot of +  lot of ] years of budgeting <laughter>.  __label__1
{C So } this is a topic of personal interest.  __label__38
{C And } let's hope [ some, + there  are other ] people that feel the same way <laughter>.  __label__22
Right.   __label__11
He was talking about, {F uh, } the City of New York and how they went and collected all this news print <noise> --  __label__39
I was born in Buffalo   __label__39
{D (( Well )) } __label__11
# {F Oh } my. #  __label__13
I guess # that # -- __label__39
{C But } when you get inside  they're really nice, {D you know, }  __label__40
{C and, } {F uh. } -  __label__0
{F Uh, } I, {F uh, } -  __label__0
Yeah   __label__7
{C and } I said just maybe because he got a lot of media hype {C and } all that   __label__39
{F Oh, } it's open,   __label__5
That's right.   __label__7
Really.   __label__11
{C and } how, -  __label__0
Yeah.  __label__11
They do,   __label__26
{C and, } {F uh, } I'm leasing the Lexus.   __label__39
[ She's, + {D you know, } she's ]  real good,   __label__39
{E I mean, } our credit cards are out to the max right now because I'm -- __label__39
{F Huh. }  __label__0
It is.  __label__7
[ it's, + it's  ] a big responsibility,   __label__40
[ I, + I ] sometimes think that it's almost frantic effort on the part of the people in the city.  __label__40
{F Uh, } {D well } my husband is French   __label__27
it, -  __label__0
Yeah,   __label__11
{C and } he still comes off great.  __label__40
Are you ready to start?  __label__37
The opposite of what you've seen.   __label__39
Fun for them.  __label__40
{C and } she went out one day on the spur of the moment and bought a tent.  __label__39
I would have to brush up on my bowling before I even tried to, {F uh, } win a lot of money for the junior achievement, __label__39
Hate to come  away feeling uncomfortable <laughter>.  __label__39
I want blue ] and purple and,  {D you know, } just different shades of that. {C Because } [ my, +  my ] house is gray,   __label__1
so they want [ to, {D you know }  try an-, + I think they're trying, ]   __label__40
# Sure. #  __label__11
recycle, because  [ we, + ] there is some bins, {D like } behind Wal-Mart, that take some things.  __label__1
{F Uh, } it was in March of last year.   __label__39
{C So, } __label__39
Uh-huh,   __label__11
{C so } he could afford to get married -- __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I, - __label__0
Have you ever head of her.   __label__37
Yeah,   __label__11
<Laughter>. __label__43
{F Um, }  {C because } [ he was, + he was  ] on some sort of news special though,   __label__39
{C but, }  {E I mean, } when I heard his album, I heard it and it was just incredible.  __label__39
{D Well, } that's pretty  ((   )) .  __label__13
-- {C and } kind of a couple of people, they just took it from me without me knowing really -- __label__39
<Throat_clearing>. __label__43
was a Visa card.  {F Uh, } issued out of a Liberty Bank in Oklahoma City,  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C but }  [ it is, + it's  ] getting worse and worse,   __label__40
{C And, } {F uh, } {D now } brakes, I've always done a lot of, {D you know, } changing brakes.  __label__39
I would love to hold her.  __label__5
I've only been there once.  __label__39
I, -  __label__0
Bye-bye.  __label__22
-- than they used to be.  __label__1
{C and } -- __label__39
Right.  __label__7
{D Well, } [ it is, +  it is ]  for me   __label__10
<Breathing>. __label__43
-- [ that, + that ] would actually ever work.  __label__1
{F um, } this is very frightening in that, {F uh, } {F oh, } -  __label__39
{C And } if you get two weeks off, you get two weeks off -- __label__40
{C and } ] he came down   __label__1
# I # also agree that, {E I mean, } if there is somebody out there that's crazy and cruel enough -- __label__40
{F Uh, } THE ROAD LESS TRAVELLED was probably one  of my favorites.   __label__39
That will be neat,   __label__13
Sure.  __label__11
Yeah.   __label__11
{F uh, } I think [ it's, + it's ] the image that the  woman has and, {F uh, } in the world, __label__40
Did they switch?  __label__37
{F Oh, } no,   __label__29
I do not like the humid-, <laughter>. - __label__39
Do you all keep a budget,   __label__37
{F Oh } yeah.   __label__11
I'm doing that more and more than I used to --  __label__39
It's about a Black singing group.   __label__39
# {F Oh } gosh. #  __label__13
Yeah.  __label__11
{F uh, } I feel, {F uh, } there should be more than a slap on the hand, __label__1
they are -- __label__40
{C and } you drill holes around the top of the head   __label__39
# of ] # thought to   __label__1
{C But, }  {F uh, } then [ the mi-, +  {F uh, }  the cauliflower, ] you, __label__8
{C but } -- __label__39
{D like } tonight I only went for thirty minutes,  __label__39
There's still no work, {D you know. } #  __label__40
-- and make it into a tent -- __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and } [ I've, +  I was ] always kind of nondescript in  that category because I always liked dogs.  __label__39
{C but, } {F uh, } South Dakota didn't really have much for, - __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
[ I've, + I've ] caught them from,  {D you know, } three or four inches long -- __label__39
[ {C And, } +  {C and } ] that's acceptable.  __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
-- who are ] totally prepared [ to tea-, + to teach ] your child everything they need to know in day care --  __label__1
Yeah.  __label__11
that we decide as a people [ what, + what  ] we're going to do.  __label__1
That's all you have time for.  __label__40
but, um. - __label__0
But there are more things we could do   __label__40
{C And } it works real good.   __label__39
{C and } she was so happy to know because she lived through Vietnam.   __label__39
# Right. #  __label__11
what was the results there. - __label__35
# I'm with # the F B I.  __label__39
Uh-huh,   __label__11
It, {F uh, } -  __label__0
right.  __label__11
Course [ it's + it's ] kind of an inside joke, {D you know. }  __label__40
{C Because } the one I went to was, {D you know, } I'm sure [ a, + a ] lot nicer than, {D you know, } a lot of the inner city schools and -- __label__40
Okay,   __label__18
{D you know, } {D actually } in this  modern day and age, it seems like,  {F uh, } {F uh, } we have more and more leisure time  because, {F uh, } we have so many [ convenience, +  appliances ] and whatnot.   __label__40
Yeah.  __label__11
{D Well, } [ I, + I ] do, {F uh, } {F uh, } programming for C N C turret presses and -- __label__39
Probably lots of laughs.  __label__40
Yeah.  __label__1
<Laughter> That's true.   __label__7
it is.   __label__7
{C so } anything like manuscripts or computer paper or  so-, __label__39
# Yeah. #  __label__11
{C so } you ought to be saving up some every month to make up for all what they should be taking out.  __label__40
{C but } because of that we didn't have very many  pets afterwards   __label__39
{C So, } I'm just real discouraged with the whole thing.   __label__39
Uh-huh,   __label__11
<Breathing> Yeah.  __label__11
{F um, } there always seems to be some prejudice to someone by anyone.  __label__1
#He was raised in the south,#   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__31
<Laughter>  That's a whole other topic -- __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
# <Throat_clearing> {D Well, } it seems like they always # -- __label__39
{C and } I'm so much worried about that as what, __label__39
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] from little on, {D you know, } -  __label__39
# Yeah. #  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__11
{C So } this year, he got lazy so I said, fine   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I have certain things that I take,   __label__39
{C So, } - __label__0
{C and, } - __label__0
No.  __label__29
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C And, } {F uh, } there is a, -  __label__0
It makes you more at ease.   __label__39
{C so, } - __label__0
{C so, } {D well, } - __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
-- I was able to do my year's study in France and able to take a lot of the other courses that interested me.   __label__1
{C And, }  I am not just talking about, {D you know, } {F uh, } role models [ of gu-, + of  tough guys ] and gangsters and things like that,   __label__39
{C Because } [ they will just, + they will just  ] come after anything then.  __label__39
Yeah,   __label__7
{D Well, } [ [ to vote, + to  vote, ] +  to just # vote # . ]  __label__1
Excuse me.  __label__19
[  We, + I ] live in Yakima, Washington.  __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
-- and things like that.   __label__1
That much land requires an awful lot of time.  __label__16
# {C But, } it's still good.   __label__13
{C and } I thought that  would be the hardest thing to do.  __label__39
{C and } when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place, __label__40
{C and, }  {E I mean } [ they were, + __label__39
{C but } I think we were genuinely concerned about [ how, + ] their military capability   __label__40
Good.   __label__13
{D Well, } okay.  __label__11
right.   __label__11
Uh-huh.   __label__11
Right.  __label__11
I don't know what  the solution to that is because the place where you buy your car, they're usually the worst one of all.   __label__40
and are [ now, + now ] that even though California has reinstated the death penalty, for whatever various crimes. -  __label__1
roughing it for me is going to the Holiday Inn and getting a shower. __label__39
{F Oh, } yeah.  __label__11
-- {D you know, } I vote no on every one of them.  __label__1
{F Oh, } I know,   __label__39
Yeah.   __label__11
<Lipsmack> # {F Uh, } #  __label__0
Wow, yeah.  __label__13
Right.  __label__11
It, -  __label__0
{C And } it's almost, {F uh, } -  __label__39
[  You, + you ] have to recognize that if you're going to <inhaling> have the very best health care possible and, {F uh, } available on demand whenever and wherever you want it, then it's going to be expensive.  __label__40
that's true.   __label__7
# {C And } that's it. #   __label__39
just your qualifications    __label__16
it is.   __label__39
{D Well, } do you think that we do it because we want it to deter crime   __label__37
[ We go, very, + very often we go ] out for fajitas.   __label__39
{F Uh, } yeah,  __label__11
{C but } {D you know, } combined with the federal income tax.  I think that American's generally do pay too much in taxes   __label__40
{C and, } - __label__0
# Uh-huh.  #  __label__11
Oh --  __label__11
I do too.   __label__39
{C So, }  {F uh, } # it was fun   __label__40
I do <laughter>.  __label__39
We've never been able to take it off our income tax.   __label__27
{C and } I said, no,   __label__39
{C but } she can't speak very clearly --  __label__39
R-, -  __label__0
{C but } I just can't seem to find the time.  __label__39
on the other hand I wouldn't want people who currently get sort  of enjoy their violence fixes from these movies to start thinking gee,  now we want to see the aftermath all the time either.  __label__39
No,   __label__29
{F uh, } <clicking> natural history museums and zoos, and all of those things that one does with # kids, {F uh, } #  __label__1
{C but } after you get into them, they're really good.  __label__40
{C and } not all of those are  necessities.  __label__40
{C and, } [ s-, + the ] dealer comes out okay -- __label__39
Yes.  __label__31
{D Well, } that's what my parents are avid  Cadillac freaks.   __label__39
we usually have  Chinese once a month.  __label__39
another movie I watched. -  __label__39
We don't have  ] a big problem with turtles,   __label__1
I certainly have some ideas since I'm studying it now in college.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C So, } {D you know, } it was prime time,   __label__39
were you at Baylor?  __label__37
{F Huh } <<very faint>>.  __label__0
{C and } when they actually get out away from the home, __label__40
it's so close,   __label__39
[ that's -- __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C but } when I bought the car that I bought now, I did that also   __label__39
<Breathing> Uh-huh.   __label__31
Oh.  __label__11
about four hundred showed up,   __label__39
{C and } every year  they get thrown out.   __label__40
{D Well, } that's interesting.  __label__13
{F Oh, } {D well } what do you do with your seventh grader?  __label__35
with a bunch of people.  __label__1
[ I've got a, + I've got a ] degree from another college --  __label__39
I assume they're doing it for that reason <noise>.  __label__39
# [ that, + ] # you get more, {F uh, } fruit and maybe cottage cheese or a chicken breast or things that aren't as, {F uh, } -  __label__39
-- {D you know, }  __label__1
# {D Well, } # what they [ wo-, +  be ]  testing for are the ones that would have {D like, } {D you know, } barbiturates  or codeine things like that in them.  __label__40
Yeah,  __label__11
{C But } then [ I, + I ] foresee that being just a baby-sitting thing not much learning  but,  {D you know, } __label__39
{C And, } __label__39
this was a big one.   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
social ] changes to talk about,   __label__1
I shouldn't make stereo types,   __label__39
{D You know, } that's quite a deterrent <laughter>.  __label__40
{D Well, } you know there are some disadvantages to being down south.  __label__40
Right.  __label__11
[ We don't have, + __label__39
{F Uh, } I live in the university district in Seattle near the University of Washington.   __label__39
# Yeah. #  __label__11
Yeah.   __label__7
# Yeah. #  __label__11
Really?  __label__17
{C but, } {F uh, } - __label__0
Can we leave the grass? <Laughter>   __label__5
I think it's the other one.  __label__39
{C Because } it's, {D like, } really flat here <laughter>.   __label__39
it's, -  __label__0
# {F Oh } my. #  __label__13
-- takes your calls and all that stuff?  __label__1
my parents came through the depression.   __label__39
They did Johnny Elway to that.  __label__39
{C and } now when I watch them, I think, why did I ever watch those?  __label__39
{C and } my husband's working   __label__39
Any basketball that I like, -  __label__39
the hunting and everything, -  __label__0
{E I mean, } we educate them,   __label__40
-- {D you know, } even though right now I'm not  driving an American car,   __label__1
Did you watch DANCES WITH WOLVES,   __label__37
In terms of you got to put everything in its own little bag and really  presort it really, {D you know, } tightly.   __label__39
I'm still trying to get  all the D M C colors <laughter>.  __label__39
Still had to cut it and everything,   __label__39
A two to three for eighty dollars.   __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yes.   __label__31
I don't know that I believe every secretary in every company needs to be.  __label__40
{C but, } {F um, } {D you know. } __label__0
this is interesting because   in my mind I don't have the stereotype of a Catholic school being a suburban kind of environment,   __label__39
Oh.  __label__11
Yeah.   __label__7
Do you,   __label__17
now I always plant trees in the fall.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D Well } how much are the box seats there?   __label__35
{C but, } - __label__0
Sounds like we have no conflict.   __label__40
Right.  __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
It has been so long since I did it that   __label__39
# {C and, } # - __label__0
Huh-uh.  __label__7
# {C But } [ th- +  # , it ] would be very  difficult to administer because I am sure that any time money and votes are involved, <laughter>   __label__40
{D Well, }  __label__27
[ the under-, + this is for underclassmen ] for June twenty-six --  __label__39
{D Well, } [ that, + that ] says a lot [ for the, + for his ] ability, though I think. __label__39
{D Well, } knock wood,   __label__39
I sort of favor the ones, -  __label__0
{C And, so, } {E I mean, } you have to find out whether there's a legitimate reason, <laughter> or whether this is a # warning signal. #  __label__39
As I say,  [ the, + the ] streams are, {F oh, } eight, ten, fifteen feet wide and so forth,   __label__39
{C and } we just started looking around.   __label__39
{C and } there are, __label__39
{C but } the oil is not going to allow us to.   __label__40
{C and, } ] {F uh, } giving the, {F uh, } police, {F uh, } agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do [ when they, + when they ] catch these people.  __label__1
{C and } some of them are our problems,   __label__40
It's out in the country   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
<Laughter>  Because, - __label__0
That's right.  __label__7
Yeah,   __label__7
Nice talking to you, Tom.  __label__22
I don't know.   __label__25
# Uh-huh. #  __label__11
someone had to figure out what was going on?  __label__38
I think the schools today, {D you know, }  [ the public schools are just, + they're just ] overrun, {D you know, }   __label__40
{C and, } {D you know, } I want a car that I can work on because I think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore.  __label__40
{C and } it got better than,  I think twenty-two, twenty-three miles a gallon.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
You are not beating rugs,  __label__16
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I'm a music major,   __label__39
{C but } <throat_clearing> [ [ they were, + half have been professionals from, ] + {F uh, } a lot of them are from, ] {F uh, } faculty at Penn State here.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
-- that was similar to that.  __label__1
{E I mean, } I don't think I ever see the Little Dipper,   __label__39
And it would save the U S money in -- __label__40
# Yeah. #  __label__11
the money will be available,   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C But, }  {F uh, } somehow or other that does manage to, {F uh, } show these little cracks.   __label__39
[ It's, + it's ] a total experience, {D you know, } getting out in nature and, __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
The irony [ is, + is ] its   people in the cities, in my experience, that are most oriented towards doing the exercise.   __label__40
I used to be a lot better than I am now.   __label__39
Right.   __label__11
yeah,   __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__22
It drives me crazy.   __label__39
We test everything after each assembly process,   __label__39
He loves it.   __label__39
{C and } she's not limping along and all that.  __label__39
To do it,   __label__7
they must have just targeted that breed and said, boy, we're going <laughter>,  __label__40
Goes for {D like } three to four weeks three times a year,  __label__39
More like embroidery or  something. - __label__39
I'm going to get  the kids to get outside with the other neighbor kids and do the little bit of raking that needs to be done.   __label__39
[ you  know, +  you know ] what I mean.  __label__32
Yeah.   __label__7
-- [ the, + the ] public themselves get health insurance   __label__1
<Throat_clearing>. __label__43
Yeah,   __label__31
{C but. } - __label__0
{C But } I think  [ about, + {F uh, } about ] a year ago, {F uh, } I bought a product from some company down [ at, + {F uh, } in ] Atlanta, Georgia.   __label__39
Down here, we seem to, -  __label__39
{D you know, } they don't pick up your recycling until <noise>  it's full   __label__39
I think it's a trend [ [ that's, + that's, ] + that's, ] {F uh, } probably may go nationwide eventually because I think national health is something that we all need.   __label__40
{C and, } - __label__0
{C and } it's really interesting that, -  __label__39
Uh-huh.   *[[b]] __label__1
{C and } [ he had, + {F uh, } he had ] not, {F uh, } displayed any tendencies deviant or disturbed or  whatever, {D you <laughter> know. }  __label__39
[ You're in, + you're in  ] the, - __label__0
It would be sort of, -  __label__0
Yeah.   __label__11
# go back # to work?  __label__1
They immediately, -  __label__0
I thought I'd better see that one before I go and see six.  __label__39
-- did a ] pretty good job.   __label__1
That's great.   __label__13
It's not a big, {D you know } -- __label__16
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__11
[ that's, + you ] need to do that.  [ [ I'll, + I'll, ] + I'll ] give you a hint.   __label__8
# Uh-huh. #  __label__11
{C And } I live, -  __label__39
# Yeah. #  __label__11
Girls are nice, aren't they?  __label__37
<Laughter>. __label__43
{C and } [ [ they, +  they, ] +  they ] {F uh, } {D you know }  really encourage them to go to college and  stuff.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I've lived in cities that really haven't had that much of a problem, although, {F uh, } I'm really kind of based in Orlando, Florida   __label__39
Oh.  __label__11
pick out where you want to live,   __label__8
Uh-huh,   __label__11
{C and } [ he, + you ] were his slave.    __label__39
{C And } I took it to Town North,   __label__39
Oh   __label__18
Right.  __label__11
Oh.  __label__11
do you know who he is?  __label__37
it's just that, I didn't, -  __label__39
{C but } I think they have the potential of becoming serious problems.  __label__40
I. - __label__0
[ That's a, + it's a ] tough, tough question,   __label__40
{C and } we have a very goal oriented population because their parents are.  __label__39
[ {C and, } + {F um, } {C and so, } ] [ I, + I ]  always felt I didn't get a real good education [ in the pu-, + in the ]  grammar schools and part of high school,  __label__39
{C and } it's also, - __label__0
I am pretty much against it <breathing> <laughter>.  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{D you know, }  ROAD AND TRACK [ had a, +  had some ] articles on, -  __label__39
People aren't going to vote for someone they've never heard of.  __label__40
{F uh, } <breathing> <lipsmack> let me see, I've got two children.   __label__39
The station finally, {A you know  how they'll put the little message down at the bottom. } __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
[ he, + he ] misses it.   __label__39
{C And } [ how, + # what's ] that?  __label__19
Yeah.  __label__11
yeah,   __label__11
Right.   __label__11
Oh.  __label__11
[ if, + # {C and } if ] it's a private sale,  of course, then there's nothing.  __label__40
{D so } [ how'd you all, + how do you, ] -  __label__0
[ {C but, } + {F uh, } {C but } ] it's good.   __label__40
{C and so } we ended up on first base  right down there on the floor,  __label__39
I sometimes wonder why men like it so much because they get so frustrated -- __label__39
It's not, -  __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and } I really feel that we  have to do something in order [ to, + {F uh, } to ] (( )) , - __label__40
yes.   __label__31
I haven't.   __label__39
{F Um, } I've lived here for six years   __label__39
# You're very wise.  #  __label__1
{C so } it's one of those things I'm just having to get used to   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{F Oh, } that sounds good.   __label__13
{C but } there is no place to, - __label__39
When I find an author I really like, I try to read everything they write. __label__39
yeah,   __label__11
{C But } then, for [ the, +  the ] family, {D you know, } I put my kids on my policy.   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{F Uh, } gee.  __label__13
It's not going to be too many more years before [ I, + ] {F uh, } {F uh, } {D you know, } they'll be gone   __label__39
No,   __label__29
-- between ] him and Reagan,   __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I sort of feel that way.  [ When they +  especially when [ someone, + [ they, + <throat_clearing>, they ] ] ] don't vote for someone   because they don't like any of them  and then the person gets in and  they don't like him  and he turns out to have been worse than her that they might have voted for, or something like that.    *[[listen: two utts?]] __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
# Okay. #   __label__11
-- it's moving north.  __label__1
{E I mean, } she falls asleep <laughter>.  __label__39
was this the first time you got to see ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS?   __label__37
Uh-huh,   __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F Oh, } yes.   __label__7
Do you, - __label__0
Right,   __label__18
{C But } I got off that.  __label__39
I shouldn't have even qualified to get it.   __label__39
You get you a pair of metric pliers, right <laughter>?  __label__37
he says, I can stick the spoon right in this.  __label__39
{F Um, }  __label__0
{C But } I gather  you do not separate,  {F uh, } the bottles and cans.  __label__16
Yeah.   __label__11
I guess I am kind of saying, [ what, + what ] are we doing?   __label__32
It was {D like } forty-five <laughter>.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Oh, geez.  __label__13
we're going to give them higher tariffs, etcetera to raise their prices to, {D you know, } ours.   __label__40
Generations from now we might, {F uh, } set back in our little, {F uh, } rocking chairs and watch our grandchildren go through an entirely different system of things and say, {D you know, } this government itself isn't working.   __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
{F Uh, } yeah.   __label__37
Do you have a boat?  __label__37
{E I mean, } [ he was, + {F uh, } he  ] didn't go to class, and so they just said, {D you know, } you can't make the grades,   __label__39
[ We're  past, + {D yeah, } we're past ] that age <laughter>.  __label__40
Oh.  __label__18
Bye.  __label__22
anyway, [ a, +  a ] luxury tax.  __label__39
I lived there for ten years.  __label__39
I think that's where a lot of the problem is at first.   __label__40
{C but } he's a football coach at Southwest Texas State University,   __label__39
Right.  __label__11
No.  __label__7
Yeah.  __label__11
He exercises a lot more than I do, though.  __label__39
# It is. #  __label__7
[ we, + I think we ] had about eight inches.  __label__39
usually there's [ a, + {F uh, } a ] double seat behind  the, {F uh, } front buckets.  __label__39
{C So } we do not know whether it is living   __label__39
{C so } why, {D you know, } -  __label__0
I didn't know any of this.   __label__39
There [ a lot of, + lot of ]  places where it's worse than it is here.   __label__39
{F Uh, } I worked in a nursing home   __label__39
You don't think about that as [ a career, + a normal career, ]  {F uh, } when -- __label__40
Right.  __label__7
{C but, } {D you know, } [ I, + he'll ] help me do the dishes.   __label__39
China was a little bit more, {F uh, }  of a challenge.   __label__39
Do you [ lik-, + listen to ] ] W R R?  __label__1
I think [ their, + their ] version of the good old boy network going that, -  __label__40
{C but, } __label__40
the prices had plummeted,   __label__39
{C so } that makes sense,   __label__40
No.  __label__7
Because if you weren't there to watch them and keep them in their own wing, [ they could, + they had ] freedom to just walk around   __label__39
it's for Cooper Industries.  __label__39
yeah.   __label__11
{C And } [ it was, + it was ] really good to see all the movies  and how the story developed,   __label__39
I know,   __label__7
{D Well, } my parents are now in San Diego,   __label__39
We passed them on to us.  __label__16
I think that's a bit dramatic,   __label__40
{D like }  sounds like you got your masters before here   __label__16
right.  __label__7
{C but } {E I mean, } he was, {F um, } - __label__0
What do you do?  __label__35
Uh-huh.  __label__11
No,   __label__29
Little small weekly things,   __label__39
is, {F uh, } that a sport you like to participate in?  __label__37
Few are, {F uh, } basically staying home and being homemakers, and raising kids exclusively.  __label__40
{C and } I get frustrated doing that   __label__39
We put them out for people   __label__39
{C and, } - __label__0
{C But, } {F uh, } -  __label__0
{C and } the weather men yesterday were all alert,   __label__39
I think it will be freedom of choice.  __label__40
Right,   __label__7
{C and } [ there's, + {F uh, } there's ]  a lot of people here in Baltimore that, {F uh, } have -  __label__39
{D Well, } providing universal health care insurance for the whole country is a pretty big task   __label__40
Right now we have a pretty nice recycling program where a lot of the recyclable materials can be picked up [ by the, + by the ] collection agency or [ the, + the ] city along with your garbage can.   __label__39
{C And, }  {F um, } [ in, + in ] the early fall time, - __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C But, }  {E I mean, } that [ did, + did ] more responsibility.   When it's yours and not your brothers <laughter>.  __label__39
{C and, }  other than that, {E I mean, } [ there was basically, +  there  was ] not educational T V  __label__39
{C But, } I don't know,   __label__0
Kind of train your mind.   *[[sv^2]] __label__1
{F Oh, } is it really?  __label__17
my husband is an only child too   __label__39
Have you ever camped on sand?  __label__37
{D well, } [ they're, +   I know they were ] still blooming up until about [ a, +  a ] few weeks ago.  __label__39
I agree with you there,   __label__7
You bet.   __label__13
being twenty-seven, you don't really have to worry about your heart rate  and that yet --  __label__40
Yeah.  __label__11
when I do recipes I just throw stuff in.   __label__39
if you, __label__39
I don't think so,   __label__28
{C because } they take up a lot. #  __label__39
{D Well, } then he should come to U T.  __label__40
{D Well, } I can imagine.  __label__13
Yeah.  __label__11
{C And, } {F uh. } - __label__0
{D Well, } [ [ they're, + it's  pretty  typical, ] + {E I mean, } it's a very, very ] middle class neighborhood.   __label__39
that's true.  __label__7
I had to have a transmission replaced in an eighty-six automobile --  __label__39
that was, [ ca-, + ]  [ very, +  very ] fortunate for them because that could have really been disastrous.  __label__40
{C and } they climb in easily   __label__39
it puts ((   ))  a whole in your money bag,    *[[spelling: hole]] __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
{C and } her name is Thumper.   __label__39
[ it's, + {D you know, } it's ] a pain to  clean   __label__40
I do that right now, <laughter> --  __label__39
yes.  __label__11
Okay <throat_clearing>.  __label__18
{D Well, } I think a lot more people could  vote if they were somehow persuaded that it's something worth caring about.  __label__40
Yeah.  __label__11
[ you could, + you could ] dry it out,   __label__39
like I said, __label__1
{D Well, } I work in machine shop and do a lot of physical labor.  __label__39
I think that that [ would, + would ] help a lot.   __label__40
# Bye-bye. #  __label__22
Yeah,   __label__0
Right.  __label__11
# Yeah,   __label__7
{C and } [ I, +  I ] think [ we need to, +  we need to ] try to figure out some way [ to, +  to ] turn that around that everybody, - __label__40
{F Uh, }  __label__11
{C and } I'd say, {D you know, } they were doing things then that we should be doing now   __label__40
{D You know, } {E I mean, } I just don't believe it.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F oh, } I see, -  __label__39
{E I mean, } if he were to use that, he might as well commit suicide -- __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and } I just assumed that it would have been.  __label__39
than my, {F uh, }  {D like } ligaments and all that should have been allowed to.  __label__1
might as well buy me a new car for that.  __label__39
{F Oh, } my Lord.  __label__13
-- that I've, {F uh, } beefed up a little bit --  __label__1
Yeah.  __label__7
{C and } that's what [ I, + I ] don't understand exactly why they don't have that option.  __label__39
# {F Oh, } yeah. # __label__11
[ About an hour. + __label__39
Yeah,   __label__7
{F Oh, } they'd have to move it to Taiwan for people not to know about it practically.  __label__40
they're not as efficient,   __label__40
-- {D well, } cause it actually is.  __label__1
{C And, }  of course we are, {F um, } about two hours from  the northern border, straight south,  __label__39
{C Because } I finished one,   __label__39
[  I, + I ] would imagine that it must be a little bit of a [ se-, + ] feeling of second class citizenry, {F uh, } to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote.  __label__40
He's got his own efficiency apartment.  __label__39
Right.   __label__11
# not # so much choose the school for  them but, {D you know, } kind of guide them along but let them more or less choose what they need and  what they're going to do.  __label__1
{C But } I can promise you that those credit card companies are going to ride high on my money <laughter>.  __label__39
{D Well, } it sounds good,  __label__13
-- {C and, } {D you know, } [ they, + they ] have in the paper, {D you know, } {D like } fifteen different categories   __label__39
It doesn't get very cold in Texas,  __label__39
He likes it.  __label__39
If you can get those benefits even, {F uh, } -  __label__40
Oh.  __label__11
in each country ] from the U S ...  __label__1
Yeah.   *[[slash error, should be 'b']] __label__1
{D now } {D you know, } the ball will go straight   __label__40
I agree.   __label__7
I don't see anything wrong with this five  day waiting period if the waiting period is utilized to really look at the background of the person purchasing the weapon.   __label__40
{D Well } {D you know, } I don't think I've ever tried cooking those, {F uh, } catfish quite that big.  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
Okay, {F um, }   __label__14
We used to do that,   __label__39
you -- __label__39
He said, No they're not.  __label__39
who do you work for?  __label__35
Yeah <cough>   __label__11
it's just, -  __label__0
Yeah,   __label__11
I like that.  __label__39
Yeah   __label__11
Do we get enough news or something like # that? #  __label__37
Wow, that's, - __label__13
Yeah.  __label__11
{C because } he's always had a garden out in the country.  __label__39
[ That's, + that's ] something I'd look for, something that would make me happy personally if I had to live there.  __label__39
# profes-, + # in a practice ] almost. __label__1
<Laughter>. __label__43
if, [ and + ] they're not arguing that the guy or woman committed the crime.   __label__1
{C and } [ I don-, + I don't ] know how many times I've seen it.  __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
in the regular trash <noise>.  __label__1
{C And then } there is wild blackberries there too.  __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
{C and } what they did do, was they all approached it [ from, + from ] very different, -  __label__39
The public school systems, {D well }  everybody's  [ kno-, +  has known ] they've needed renovation for years, but never really had a clear  direction on which way to go with it.  __label__40
-- because that's a lot of fun, especially this time of year where it's so nice out.  *[[sv]] __label__1
{C and } we recently purchased a new home,   __label__39

{D Well, } that's neat.  __label__13
this is the southwest,   __label__39
I agree <laughter>.  __label__7
-- # yeah,   __label__11
{C and } before that I also had an Accord,   __label__39

Yes   __label__31
{D Well, } I'm from Kentucky,   __label__39
<Laughter>  Also, I took an iron back after having it only one year.  __label__39
Right.   __label__11
It's, {F uh, } really a serious issue for those of us up in this, {F uh, } sector [ up, +  up ] here.  __label__40
That's funny.  __label__40
-- for the truck.   __label__1
Yeah.  __label__11
{C and } they just punch it.  {D You know, }   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D now, } {D well }  seventies music, {E I mean, } [ [ I'm, +  like I said,   yo-, ] +  disco, I ]  don't like disco,   *[[more than one utt]] __label__39
uh-huh. #  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__12
{C and so } I said, Hey, this was a cinch,   __label__39
{F uh, } {D well } that's how society has changed, {F uh, } __label__40
-- a new concern with people.  __label__1
Where do you take your cans?   __label__35
# {C And, } # - __label__0
{C and } are we getting what we pay for?   __label__37
I thought it was a fantastic idea.  __label__40
Yeah.  __label__11
they had, {F uh, } a murder mystery,  __label__39
I think President Bush handled it  all politically very smart, {D you know, } giving the support [ of, +  of ] the other Arabs  and other nations in the world   __label__40
{C so } -  __label__0
Okay.  __label__11
{C But } {D anyway, } at least she can go   __label__39
it's like school,   __label__40
[ [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] + {D you know, } {C and, } ] [ it, +  it's ] almost like, - __label__40
uh-huh.  __label__11
# What does # that house got attraction?  __label__5
Huh-uh.  __label__11
{D Now, } [ I, + they ] sometimes they jump on it   [ [ and, + and, ] + and ] go a little to the extreme,   __label__40
It's really neat.   __label__40
[ {C and } -- + __label__40
I've got some applications,   __label__39
you want to start?  __label__8
{D well } [ two, + two ] of them actually.   __label__39
{E I mean, } as far as I was concerned, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES could have been a classic of world theater --  __label__40
Did we,  __label__38
{D Well, } listen, {F uh, } I think  [ I've, +  I've ] exhausted my, {F uh, } self on, -  __label__39
make sure the kid goes to a school where they get sort of a general education   __label__40
sir.  __label__39
{C and } I sort of toured the area,   __label__39
-- because, - __label__1
are they going  to tell us to stop or what <laughter>?  __label__37
Yeah   __label__7
-- {C and } when we did, {F uh, } -  __label__39
Yes.  __label__7
Right,   __label__7
{C And } also I'm interested in writing some programs that will kind of  {D like } remind me of things  like remind me that Wednesdays is trash day and the like.  __label__39
{F Oh, } Stripper, {D well } he started out being a little orphan,   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{F Oh } yeah,   __label__1
# Because # everybody has a different idea of where the money should go.  __label__1
one guy said the judge looked at him and said, {D "Well, } {D now, } Mister So and  So," he says, "I have never seen, {F uh, } calves follow a bull.   __label__39
right,  __label__11
-- that'll be very nice.  __label__13
{E I mean, } I'm sure you heard # about # -- __label__38
-- {C and } I usually come away  thinking, no I really don't like this show <laughter>.  __label__39
{F Oh, } really?  __label__17
{C but } I have [ on a lot, + a lot ] of times.  __label__39
Right.  __label__7
# Schedule vacation # time   __label__11
Yeah,   __label__11
I try, {D you know, } __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
Uh-huh.   __label__11
{C But } I also don't remember lots of little pieces #   __label__39
<noise> {C So, } [ it, + it's ] interesting.  __label__40
I have two sons living down there   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
# That's right. #  __label__7
She said, I know she doesn't get to touch it.   __label__39
Flexible hours [ are, + are ]  pretty important to me as well.  __label__39
have you had any former Suzuki students?  __label__37
I think it should still be taught in schools.  __label__40
[ Have  you, +  have you  ] received many?  __label__37
{C And, } {F uh, } on special occasions,  {E I mean } birthdays and things like that.   __label__1
Good-bye.  __label__22
it had a microwave in it and  everything,  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{C or, } - __label__0
{C and } people down here are just, -  __label__40
no,   __label__7
{C because } I think he'd like that one.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__31
didn't he have a woman,   __label__37
Yeah, {F uh, }   __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
{D you know, } you didn't, __label__40
{F Uh, } yeah,   __label__7
# I'm not sure # -- __label__39
{C and } I thought,  {D well, } this will be great,   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
can't reform <laughter> them.  __label__1
I've seen some nice, nice sailboats.   __label__39
I'll never forget that   __label__39
{D you know, } I had a, -  __label__39
# {D you # know? }  __label__1
-- get them fed, get them to practices -- __label__1
The housing is cheaper,   __label__39
You had to come home and # clean before you could # -- __label__16
-- {C and, }  {F uh, } {D you know } when the waves go in  the waves go out they kind of all of a sudden you're in sand above your ankles.  __label__40
{F Oh, } how nice. <laughter>   __label__13
and a lot of places we go in to, you just kind of, uh, -  __label__39
[ {C but, } + {C but, } ] {F um, } {D like } our miniature Schnauzer, [ she's just, + she's just ] {D like, } {F um, } a little hyper thing and just prances around and jumps all over everybody acting silly,   __label__39
{D Well } that's good.  __label__13
No,   __label__7
When you sat in the seats, they adjusted to fit around you.  __label__39
Yeah.   __label__7
# Really? #  __label__17
{C and } {E I mean, } [ it, + it ] got to the point he was eating a pear here,   __label__39
that ki-, -  __label__0
Yeah.  __label__11
{C but } I didn't have  my number yet,   __label__39
what can we do?  __label__32
<Laughter>. __label__43
{C So } we never have to pay anything extra.  __label__39
I wanted my  children   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
-- # [ it's, + it's ] <talking>  <<female and children in the background>>, # __label__1
{F Oh, } is it like an automatic debit   __label__37
Yeah,   __label__11
{D Well } [ I guess, + I guess ] the extension of that is, [ why, + why ] not, -  __label__32
No   __label__29
{F Uh, } [ what, + {F uh, } what ] sort.   __label__35
You go somewhere else.   __label__40
That's why you check books out from the library.  __label__40
You're kidding?  __label__13
you did a great job.    __label__5
Yes,   __label__31
# Right. #  __label__11
{C so. } - __label__0
Right.  __label__11
{F Uh, } I think one of the big things he's involved with is the micro gravity payloads.   __label__40
<Breathing> that really sc-, -  __label__0
Education, raising consciousness awareness, -  __label__40
Yeah.  __label__11
Centimeters.  __label__12
{C And then } just in general, I sleep a lot better --  __label__39
I think that they would benefit also in doing community service so that they can see   __label__40
{D Well, } [ my, + my ]  grandfather is the only one that is still around.  __label__39
yeah.  __label__7
{F uh, } really sweet.  __label__40
[ {C And, } + {C  and, } ] {F uh, } then an uncle is dead.   __label__39
It certainly means that we don't have to experience everything,   __label__40
Yeah.  __label__31
Well, the oth-, the other instance I think of their inability to, to handle things, the cholera, __label__39
What do they do?  __label__35
{D well } that's why I ended up giving it back to  him.   __label__39
Right.  __label__11
{F Um, }  one of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high of say ninety-nine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
uh-huh.  __label__11
That's right <laughter>.  __label__7
everybody seems to be, -  __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
{C and } he's kind of  like your wife.   __label__40
the crime rate is the worst than ever before.  __label__1
Bye.  __label__22
{D well, } - __label__0
[ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C but, } ] {F uh, } keep the weeds out of them [ and, + and ] keep them off the ground so the ants don't eat them.   __label__39
right,   __label__7
Do you have any?  __label__37
{C And } they have said no <laughter>.  __label__39
Oh.  __label__11
-- {C and } he's got a attorney that you and I could never afford.  __label__39
<Laughter> Yeah,   __label__22
Ours are those too,   __label__39
[ I think that probably, + I think ] most companies now, as far as entry, __label__40
<Laughter> You're right.  __label__13
I don't get a, -  __label__39
{C but }  there really is only about a half a dozen, {F uh, } things   __label__39
{C and, } {D you know, } they're all {D like, }  {F um, } kind of regretful, I think.  __label__39
#  What kinds of things do you fix?  __label__35
I think in {D like, } {F uh, } lesser cases it's {D like } ten out of twelve or five out of six, whatever <child>. __label__39
# Right,   __label__11
# Yeah. #   __label__11
{D like, } {F uh, } Ivan Rodriguez wasn't even born [ when, + when, ] {F uh, } Nolan Ryan started pitching.  __label__39
# them # whatever, that, society has to pay, {F uh, }  (( upwards )) , {F uh, } thirty thousand dollars a year to incarcerate them.  __label__1
# Visit,   __label__12
that's,  -  __label__0
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } they said the other night his contract is so big that if anything happens to him, {D you know, } if they don't trade him, they'll have to pay him off, {D you know. }   __label__39
-- power   __label__1
{C so, } {F uh, } that was a real, -  __label__39
{C And then } they take these things that will rust   __label__39
I really was disappointed this year when I see any of the candidates talking that they're talking about.   __label__39
# I have his book, # too.  __label__39
{C and } you need to make sure all your bills are paid.   __label__39
I was ready to go back and see it again, {D you know }   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__0
{C And, } {F uh, } fortunately it worked.   __label__39
-- rather than a -- __label__1
Bye-bye.  __label__22
{C and } it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
# {F uh, } I # think, [ [ given, + {F uh, } given, ] + {D well } given ] that there are so many people who don't have health insurance.  It's probably a real smart thing, __label__40
# Uh-huh. #  __label__11
{E I mean, } he seemed to know what he was doing   __label__40
-- getting dirty needles and everything.  __label__1
{F uh, } # if the Rangers will go up a little bit. #   *[[ I think this should end in a slash.  B's next turn seems to start with a backchannel of A.19. ]] __label__1
-- {C and, } {F uh, } it really does  make a difference, although [ it, +  it ] settles, {D you know, }   __label__40
{C so, } yeah   __label__0
I finally said, Gee, this is kind of a waste of time.   __label__39
[ I, + I ] hadn't been to the movies for a really long time -- __label__39
Uh-huh,   __label__11
Bye.  __label__22
{C but } I would buy some cheap wallpaper from somewhere and cover those nice boxes with the lids,  __label__39
{C and, } {F uh, } - __label__0
{C and } I'm really glad she did   __label__39
{C But, } [ I was, + I have ] a problem with all the killing,   __label__39
It may be.   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__31
-- get rid of  him and not have to pay his contract.  __label__1
I'll let you start.   __label__39
Well the, - __label__0
Uh-huh,   __label__31
Okay.   __label__14
{F Uh. } *[[slash error]] __label__14
Yeah.  __label__11
{F Hm. }  __label__11
{D Well, } {F uh, } how long were we s-, -  __label__35
Yearly fee,   __label__16
Uh-huh.  __label__11
seems like every time that we have a dinner party, or that we are going some place where everybody is suppose to bring something and they have  had my rolls before. __label__39
[ It just, + it, ] -  __label__0
{D So. } - __label__0
{C And } I always remembered it was my own fault,   __label__39
[ we're sup-, -- + __label__40
that -- __label__0
{C And } what are you doing?  __label__35
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C so, } - __label__0
[ she's, + she's ] a squirrel for, {F uh, } {F uh, } contractor out at American Airlines.  __label__39
Okay,   __label__11
{F Um. }  __label__11
How did you ever get into that?   __label__35
All righty,   __label__11
<Laughter>. __label__43
It's B, A, R, G, E, double L, O <<spells out the word>>  __label__39
{F Oh, } they did?  __label__17
-- {F um, } I'd rather go to any other college, {D you know, } in the state,   __label__39
{F Oh, } definitely,   __label__7
[ You hear a, + you hear a ] Paula Abdul song   __label__39
Uh-huh <<very faint>>.  __label__11
{C And } apparently [ [ it's, + {D you know, } it, ] + it ] went off pretty much without a hitch.   __label__39
{C and } ours is seventy dollars a week plus all activities --  __label__39
-- {F um, } {C so, } [ that's, + in my opinion, [ that's get-, + that's bordering ] ] on a health clinic,   __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
+ [ the, + ] I think ] almost the only way that drug testing can be done fairly is if it's across the board [ from, + from ] the janitors to the executive management.  __label__40
Not right now,   __label__28
[ {C but, } +  {C but, ] } {D you know, } [ the, + the ] merits of the case in terms of, {D you know, } __label__40
# Yeah,   __label__7
{F Uh, } did you ever go to Texins at all  when you were working for T I?   __label__37
{C And } that's exactly right.   __label__7
or if she wants an afternoon off. __label__1
{F Oh, } uh-huh.  __label__11
That's my, -  __label__0
-- {C and } I find that I'm enjoying this one  far more than I ever did when it was the children's dog,  __label__39
{D Well, }  {D see } that's something I want to see,  __label__39
{C and } they've  been convicted   __label__40
-- using it.   __label__1
# {D Well } I, # - __label__0
my oldest son goes to A and M.  __label__39
Let's just turn it on and see what's on.   __label__5
{F Oh, } my God.  __label__13
exactly.   __label__7
Not from Texas. #  __label__40
{F Huh. }  __label__11
<laughter> {D well, } there's, {F uh, } -  __label__0
-- what's a license cost?  __label__35
{D You know. }  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
The only problem with those is sometimes  they get holes in the bottom.  __label__39
I just cut slices off   __label__39
Right.   __label__7
Yeah.  __label__11
I guess it depends on whoever  you buy it from how fast they turn them in or something.  __label__39
# That's, # - __label__0
{D Well, } that's good.   __label__13
{C or, } - __label__0
{C so. } - __label__0
-- {C but } I haven't upgraded it quite that far yet.   __label__39
It might rain on your little parade.  __label__40
{C And, } {F uh, } it's been in two, maybe three times.   __label__39
-- {D now } maybe we don't call these personal computers, {F um, }   __label__40
{C and }  I talk to them,   __label__39
{C but } whenever I find, {D you know, } a dime or something on the ground, I, I'll probably pick it up <laughter>.  __label__39
Definitely.  __label__13
completely.   __label__39
{F Um, } [ a fairly, + a fairly ] good amount, {F uh, } more on the weekends,   __label__26
Period.  __label__39
I do not know how they do scale down there.   __label__39
# {F Uh. } #  __label__11
[ it was a, + it was a ] housing division.   __label__39
{C And } when you walked into their room, they had brought all their furniture from their house  --  __label__39
It was interesting. __label__39
we know how that goes.   __label__13
{C and } hopefully we'd catch our supper,   __label__39
[ It's   hurting, +   {D you know, } it's hurting ] Germany, for example, too,  and some other parts of Europe [ where they, + where they  ] have high industry.   __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D Like } I had three children,   __label__39
{D Well, } that's true.   __label__7
{D You know, } maybe if you did like Hank Williams and  Garth, {D you know, } maybe you would enjoy [ Tra-, + {F uh, } Randy Travis. ]  __label__40
{C And } he'll say, {D you know, } {D hey, }  that guy did it, {D you know, } not me.  __label__39
as soon as they get elected, the people dump all kinds of money on them and say, {D Yeah, }  {D yeah, }   you're my friend,   __label__40
{F Um, } {C but } benefits, -  __label__0
{C but, } - __label__0
got them on both sides,   __label__39
Right <laughter>.  __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
[ {D well, } it's, +  {F um, } {D well, }  it's, ] {F uh, } ten o'clock here in Falls Church, Virginia.  __label__39
People that are, {F uh, } driving -- __label__39
{C but, } - __label__0
Right.  __label__11
-- {C so } you carry them with you,   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__7
<Laughter>. __label__43
[ How f-, + how far ] are you from Houston?  __label__35
I think it's pretty exciting that they can, {F uh, } -  __label__40
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] you know what?  __label__32
<Talking>. __label__43
{C and } sometimes I set there all evening.  __label__39
One of them is called, {F uh, } WEALTH WITHOUT RISK.  __label__39
-- and things like that --  __label__1
I don't know,   __label__25
Yeah,   __label__11
We're also have a very humongous trade deficit,   __label__39
it's fun.   __label__40
You take a flour tortilla   __label__39
{C and } the pansies looked terrible,  but they came back later.   __label__39
[ {C And, } +  {E I mean, } {C so } ] I'd say  at least, two usually three times a week he takes his lunch.  __label__39
# {C And } [ she told me # + she said ] she could tell them for fifteen minutes places not to go [ in, + __label__39
{C and, } {D you know, } [ don't, + don't ] be -- __label__40
# Right,   __label__11
{C and } they just, {D you know, }  don't want to or don't have the time.  __label__39
Yep.  __label__11
-- under two   __label__1
{C and } it's interesting.   __label__39
Really?   __label__17
you just spend time on maybe ten acres of it.  __label__39
-- {D you know, } [ when + when ] you work at a company whether you know it or not, is that you're categorized.   __label__40
# like, # {D you know, } [  some, + a ] professional would [ I try to, + I go ] real slow   __label__1
I don't remember doing all these things.  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
<Breathing> {F Oh, } I'm actually right on the Plano line.  __label__39
{D Well, } [ I don't want to, + I don't want this to ] be a unilateral <laughter> conversation  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
[ I don't, + I don't ] drink,   __label__39
I, {F uh, } -  __label__0
# all over, # {D you know, } the, {F um, } city   __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
[ You know -- + __label__37
I think everybody would say that.  __label__40
How funny.  __label__13
{C and then, } - __label__0
{F Uh } yeah  __label__11
{C And } [ [ I, + I think that in the future you're, ] + I think you're ] going to see a lot more, {F um, } women choosing to not work after they have a baby.  __label__40
Yeah.  __label__11
-- interesting.  __label__1
it looks -- __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
Sure, {F uh, } - __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
A machine that puts  (( back grind ))  tape on and off the  (( waivers )) .  __label__39
companies are pretty good about accepting returns on products like that when they're not needed after all,   __label__40
# <sigh> # __label__43
I think we'll try to do something a little bit, -  __label__39
{C and, } [ [ we, + you, ] + you ] just get used to air conditioning all the time,  __label__40
No.   __label__29
{D Well, } we have been drenched.  __label__39
including rural districts, don't seem to be able  to produce the students that, [ ind-, + indeed ] many, {F uh, } manufacturing and other, __label__1
Yeah.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
yeah.  __label__0
# {C So, } if you really # computed it, they probably -  __label__40
[ # That's, # + __label__7
Yeah.  __label__11
-- with that.  __label__1
And getting her to, {D you know, } -  __label__1
{C and } unfortunately. - __label__0
Huh-uh.  __label__11
If they're above the knee they turn into shorts, {D you know. }  __label__40
Yeah.  __label__11
{C because } I'm fifty-five,   __label__39
<Inhaling> I am more into rock and roll myself.  __label__39
{C but, } {F oh, } if they catch me they're going to kill me   __label__5
there is ] no question it had an overwhelming effect of how we approached [ the, + the ] thing in, {F uh, } Iraq.  __label__1
-- {C and } we couldn't get the light to turn off.  __label__39
I find [ [ that + -- __label__40
[ [ I try, +  [ I, +  I ]  really do, ] +  I just try ] to stay out of  debt,   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
[ they were. +  I was ] listening to some of the comments on [ ra-, +  television ] the other day, __label__39
Our, {F uh, } physical and mental and  spiritual health, {F uh, } it's really, {F uh, } very costly.  __label__40
I didn't really need power windows, but it has power, {D you know, } windows -- __label__39
-- ever.  __label__1

{C and } the lake that we learned on was the smaller of the two that we had access to   __label__39
-- {C and, }  {F uh, } just every time I would start to get into the movie, and it was getting good -- __label__39
That's always a good thing.   __label__40
{D You know } in the summertime when it's really, really hot.  __label__1
And helping a family that's come over from Russia.  __label__1
<Laughter> {E I mean } [ that's, + that's ] sort of my, __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
(( What are you providing )) ?  __label__35
Yeah,   __label__31
{F Uh, } [ it, + it ] really, {F uh, } -  __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
-- {F uh, } we had a pond across the street   __label__1
Not for me.  __label__7
{F Um, }   [ that's   on at, + let's see, it's on at ] four.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
like I say, [ th-, + the ] overall appearance of this house  is what really devalued it so much.   __label__39
Now, now, now that used to be a luxury,   __label__40
what it's doing is it's going through, {F uh,  }   __label__39
sort of {D like, } {D you know. } - __label__1
[  I can't + <laughter>, I can't ] draw it out of my own head -- __label__39
{D Well, } it's so crowded up there.  __label__40
yeah,   __label__7
{D Well, } have you ever, {F uh, } had a family reunion?  __label__37
-- and, {F uh, } layer all that.   __label__1
<Laughter>. __label__43
They're not really sure of what they are.  I don't think.  __label__40
{D Well } what's scary is, {F uh, } {F uh, } about two, three, four months ago [ on a Sun-, + in the Sunday ] edition of what is called the morning paper here, The DALLAS MORNING NEWS.  __label__39
E-, -  __label__0
Uh-huh.   __label__11
{C and, }   a-, -  __label__0
# Uh-huh.   __label__11
{C And, }  {F uh, } I don't know,   __label__25
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] that's it.  __label__40
Uh-huh.   __label__11
-- mother-in-law.  __label__1
Yeah.  __label__11
{C and, }  {F uh, } he said there  was nothing wrong with the alternator   __label__39
No.  __label__29
I just don't like squash.  __label__39
The smaller and the, - __label__2
{F Oh, } great.  __label__13
Okay.   __label__22
{C But, }  when he gets angry, it's always over control  issues, it's always  over power issues, it's never over, {D you know, }  it's always, you said you were going to do something   __label__39
she really was.  __label__39
Last year we wanted to show my husband what a baseball game was because, __label__39
# Yeah. #  __label__11
{C But } I,  ((   )) , - __label__0
{C So, } - __label__0
A lot of times the parents get into it just as much [ as, + as ] the kids,   __label__40
{C So, } it's so much easier to sit there   __label__40
{C and, } - __label__0
Do you want to be an R N   __label__37
{E I mean } I can understand that, {D actually. }  __label__39
They, __label__40
-- I've kind of chosen, {F uh, } I believe it that, {F uh, } big time drug importers, like, {F uh, } {D say } Noriega for example -- __label__1
{C but } they do what [ they, + they ] # want to do with it. #  __label__40
we do do things,  __label__39
{C and, } {F uh, } {F uh, } the ice and snow just doesn't, {F uh, } hold any allure for me at all.  __label__39
# {C but } # I went up ten cents.  __label__40
<Laughter>. __label__43
Uh-huh.  __label__11
# {F um, } #  __label__11
she said I have taken a new stance,   __label__39
Uh-huh.   __label__11
something to the effect that if they could just pay to get twenty percent, or, take all the cars off the road that have been, uh, manufactured say before nineteen seventy-five, __label__39
unless it just hangs there like in places where it's a lot of pollution, {D you know, } like in Los Angeles [ or, + or ] the bigger cities where [ it, + it ] tends to get stuck there, - __label__39
It was a lot nicer than I expected.  __label__39
Bye, bye.  __label__22
{C And then } there's an attache case, and cordless telephone,   __label__39
{C And } I think that's good,   __label__40
{C and then } once they do get elected, they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised, {D you know, } beforehand.  __label__40
{D Well } -- - __label__11
{F Oh, } <laughter> {D well, } at least you know you did your part.  __label__40
[ from, + I believe she was from  ] the Honduras or Guatemala, or somewhere in there,   __label__39
yeah   __label__11
# They're only going # to suffer.  __label__40
{F Oh, } really?  __label__17
# for # the recycling to Children's Hospital, which I think is an excellent idea, __label__1
that T I now has C N N on all the time.  __label__1
I don't know if it was just the. - __label__40
okay.   __label__0
{C And } also with a router, you can,  {F uh, } make ornamental facings, too better than a just straight wood edge. __label__39
it used all of it.   __label__39
[ [ That's, + that's,  ] + that  ] threw our budget really <laughter>  out of whack too.   __label__39
{C and } you don't know which set to reach in, American or metric.  __label__40
Right.   __label__11
{C and } people got to [ choo-, + pick and  choose, ]   __label__39
# forty-one Americans, # __label__1
-- {C and, } {D you know, } [ we h-, +   we had ] a neighbor in Nebraska when we lived there that had, {F uh, } Brittany Spaniels   __label__39
{D Well, } {F uh, } the trends in the families  were to spread apart, do your own thing.  __label__40
{D Well, } I think that's true,   __label__7
{D you know } when he quits at being active, he will go into, {D you know } -- __label__39
{C But } here you don't get that.   __label__39
{F Huh. }  __label__11
{C and } in five years,    it sh-, -  __label__5
to, -  __label__0
Didn't find time to even read it.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
[ [ [ I, +  I'm, ] +  {D well } {D ya-, } I, ] + {D you know, } I'm ]  assuming that it can be done.  {F Uh, }   __label__39
{C but } -  __label__0
{F Oh, } you don't have time.  __label__12
Huh-uh.  __label__11
Have you?  __label__17
That's right.   __label__7
you get so attached to them.  __label__39
{C and } {E I mean, } I had geometry,   __label__39
I guess I kind of do a similar thing.   More, {F uh, } medium or  longer range.   __label__39
{C But, }  {F uh, } [ I do, + I do ] have to make myself go,   __label__39
{C and } [ the, + the ] teacher had eleven kids.   __label__39
{C So } [ it really wasn't, + it was ] weird because we had snow <laughter>.  __label__39
{F Uh, } although we, -  __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C And } [ he goes to, +  no Guatemala, because he goes to ] virgo church  in Guatemala City.   __label__40
# Yes,   __label__7
At the same time you think, {D God, } I hope I don't sound like  a stage mother because, __label__40
{D Well, } {F uh, } typical lawn stuff.   __label__39
that's true.  __label__7
[ we, + at the time we ] thought we might buy a mobile home,  __label__39
{C and, } - __label__0
{C but } they're giving it to other people that don't really need it [ ei-, + either, ]   __label__40
{C So } what had happened is that professional painters had not prepared the surface properly.   __label__39
{F Uh, } the last, -  __label__0
{C Because } [ that's, + that's ] what I like,   __label__39
{C and } I really enjoy getting around and  seeing the different areas with different gardens,   __label__39
For both of us.  __label__1
{F Um, }  I put out [ a, + a ] trash can [ [ and, + and ] + ] for people to put their aluminum cans in,  __label__39
before   __label__1
I'm in California  ((   )) .  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D You know, } [ we're, + we're, ] __label__5
{C and, } __label__39
{C And } [ I think, + I think ] you're going to see a lot more of that in the future.  __label__40
-- a very picky eater   __label__1
{C But } how do they afford to even  have the kids, {F uh, }   __label__35
I know.  __label__7
that, -  __label__0
{D so } <laughter>. - __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
at least on  the surface it sounds like a good thing.   __label__40
{C but } it's just, - __label__0
{D So, } {F um, } {C and } I feel that way too as far as, {D you know, } just sitting and [ doing, + {D you know, } [ to, + ] the idea of doing ] fifty sit-ups or something, {D you know, }   __label__39
it is.  __label__7
Yeah.  __label__11
{C But } [ I, + <lipsmack> I ] do think it's an area that needs to be looked at and improved because more of us are going to have to work.  __label__40
you can't do that.  __label__40
and ] Texas Instruments,  <laughter>.   __label__1
Yeah,   __label__31
Uh, but I've not, you know, -  __label__0
{F Uh, } you don't, {F uh, } -  __label__0
{C and } she says, why haven't you read that.   __label__39
{C so. } - __label__0
{E I mean } [ just, + just ] scratching two or  three inches was just a chore.  __label__39
{C so }  [ the parent, + __label__39
{C and } it was really good.  __label__39
dumb ] retrievers   __label__1
{C And } I don't mean give it to  everybody that asks.   __label__40
{C and } you want, - __label__0
{C and } yet, {D you know, } [ with, + {F uh, } with, ] {F uh, } -  __label__0
{C and } the, - __label__0
I guess it was January, when, {F um, } Jimmy Johnson got named coach of the year or whatever.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yeah.   __label__11
# {F uh, } I'm not working  right now.   __label__39
at least, # {D you know, } # -- __label__39
{C and, }   {F uh, } had a lot of trouble with injuries, too.  __label__39
{C But } [ I think the whole, + {D you know, } ideally <baby> I think, ] {F uh, } business should have the, __label__40
that's right.  __label__11
Most people [ [ get marrie-, + {E I mean } get, ] + go to college ] or at least get a job   __label__40
Yeah,   __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
[ [ you + you ] + you ] really throw a lot on the courts, hopefully that they won't do that {D you know } [ for any + for any ] situation really.   __label__40
<Laughter>. __label__43
-- and has, {F um, } paneling in the living room, and  [ lots of, + lots ] of tans and lots of browns --  __label__1
You have a fenced yard or, - __label__37
[ That's, + that's ] interesting.   __label__40
{D Well, } [ it's, + it ] started out as a hobby {D actually. }  __label__39
{C and so } there were seven of them that, {F uh, } -  __label__39
And the Ambassador said, yes,   __label__39
{D Well, } is REDBOOK still in existence?   __label__37
{C and } that's what really is getting me about what George Bush's stand on the budget is right now -- __label__39
{C but } he never drives a car either, {D you know, }   __label__40
{C and } they [ get them, + get them ] early parole in order to make rooms for  the new criminals who stay there for their six weeks   __label__39
It's an accusation,   __label__40
{C and, } __label__39
I think some of what we consider rights are really more privileges [ than, + than ] what most people think of them as.   __label__40
{D Well, } that's the idea.   __label__7
{C but } we just, -  __label__0
{F Uh, }  ((   ))  I still enjoy watching those.   __label__39
{C So, } {F uh, } I don't know if she's any farther ahead than those kids who started when they were eight   __label__39
{D well, } {D you know, } we, -  __label__0
{F Oh, } # {D well, } I guess, # __label__40
It's not just random people.  __label__39
{D So. } - __label__0
that's what I'm saying,   __label__39
{C And } if they can't, {E I mean } if they have  missed that training, then somebody, {D you know, } before [ you're, + you're ] start  penalizing them with bad grades for not being able to communicate what they're thinking, teach them these basic skills.  __label__40
{C So } that's why we have to work real hard when we get a concert together.  __label__39
{C but } I've never actually seen the place itself, {D you, __label__39
They do it by lethal injection, # at Huntsville. #  __label__39
# Oh. #  __label__11
yes.  __label__7
Uh-huh.  __label__11
No.  __label__7
{C But } {D anyway, } that's, -  __label__0
{D like } just over the weekend I visited my family, and some cousins I hadn't seen in a long time,   __label__39
I guess I relate it [ to, + to ] Japan where things  are very expensive, # aren't they? #  __label__37
{C But, } even if they had three car garages, they didn't have a work space.   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__31
do you consider yourself a liberal? <breathing>  __label__37
All right   __label__14
Just because there's a friend up there,   __label__39
{F Oh, } really,  __label__11
He'll come back, show up at just the right moment.  __label__39
right.   __label__11
# Uh-huh,   __label__11
{C So, } if I see any signs I'm going to spray them,  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
he just pitched his first, {F uh, }  exhibition game a day or so ago,  __label__39
It was.  __label__7
[ a, + a ] few of my little hobby projects have totally bombed,   __label__39
Alright,   __label__22
<Music> {D Well, } {F uh } I don't know that we really have a budget.   __label__39
That's, __label__40
{C And } she came with skirts, just  like she'd be going into the office.  __label__39
{C but } I didn't make enough money to really <breathing> make, __label__39
No.  __label__11
Right.  __label__11
{C so, } {F uh, } it's not t-, -  __label__0
I have people that want to go to Dallas.  __label__22
There really is   __label__39
[ of course, of + course, ]  they could say, {D well, } I can't give you a card,   __label__39
{C And } once you've established the fact that you're not a drug user and especially if your personality proves that you're not.  I think they could, {F uh, } save money by not doing that.  {D You know, }  every time,   __label__39
{F Well } that's fact.  __label__13
# {D Like } who cares?   __label__32
{F Huh. }  __label__0
Yeah --  __label__11
[ [ those, +   I wish those ] countries could have the same type of freedoms or whatever that we do.  __label__40
{C so. } - __label__0
{F Oh, } really,   __label__17
[ m-, + ] yeah, <laughter>.  __label__7
Of course, {D you know, } it is so  weird,   __label__40
{C But } that's all right.  __label__39
you get hardware,   __label__39
{F Uh, } [ [ [ I, + I just, ] + I, ] + my husband ] is in business for himself --  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I know it,   __label__13
Right,   __label__11
{C so } I couldn't smell this,   __label__39
[ I, +  I ] have chosen to stay at home, __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C but } [ it, + it's ]  really bad here.   __label__39
-- I know it affected me when I was younger.   __label__39
they need to really focus on the children [ in the wor-, + in this country. ]  __label__40
That's neat.  __label__13
good,   __label__22
{C and, } __label__0
Uh-huh,   __label__11
# Huh.  #  __label__11
I'm going to have to move fast, __label__39
[  You, + you ] wouldn't be able to under our system.  __label__39
{C but } I didn't know what I was saying.   __label__39
-- policy.   __label__1
post office or the bank or any kind of errand,   __label__1
# Uh-huh.  #  __label__11
{C but } {D you know } you need to pretty soon.  __label__40
{F Oh, } wow.  __label__13
{F Uh, } __label__11
# {C so } ] it's, # __label__1
I'm an soap opera fanatic.  __label__39
{C and } # it was # -- __label__39
right.  __label__11
The real estate out here's been pretty good.   __label__39
{D Well, } really [ it, + <static>  {F uh, } the letter ] just says, {F um, } -  __label__39
{D Well, } [ when I was, + {D you know, } when I was ]  growing up I had a clean the cat pan all the time,   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Really?  __label__17
Delaware?  __label__38
yeah.  __label__7
# Good. #  __label__13
((   )) . __label__43
I guess, {F uh, } there's some, {F uh, } things on Channel Thirteen that I watch pretty regularly.  __label__39
I didn't even, __label__39
{F Uh, } [ he was, + he was ]  a veterinarian, and killed two, a father and a son, okay.  __label__39
{C and } she had a nursing degree,  __label__39
{C And } it was really wild.   __label__39
Did that scare you a little bit? __label__37
Her grandmother lives there --  __label__39
{F Oh, } definitely.  __label__26
Just so I can enjoy them.   __label__1
That's the first thing he wanted.  __label__39
{C So, } {F um, } she pretty much, {D you know, } just assumed that I would know, {D you know, } how to handle them.   __label__39
go ahead.  __label__8
{D Well, } - __label__0
I must have {D like } fifty or sixty books by him <laughter>.  __label__39
I would too,   __label__39
[ If you can, + __label__39
I think that when they <breathing>  receive help from us, they want it,   __label__40
[ {C and then, } + {D you know, } {C so } ] we got our day care free.  __label__39
Hello.  __label__23
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D Well, } I know that we have some relatives that live around, {D like } the  ((   )) area in there,  __label__39
{C so } he's not quite two  and a half yet.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D Well, } we've tried having, -  __label__39
[ (( I h-, )) + I have ] to  believe everybody is starting to pay attention and take heed of what is happening.  __label__40
yeah.  __label__11
quality time with them, {D you know, } outside of the work day.  __label__1
I could see where that would be a problem,   __label__39
There was <child_talking> some plants that are just Spring bloomers --  __label__39
{C And, } {F uh, } - __label__0
<Laughter> {C So, }  that's right.  __label__26
I'm going to do it right, and see if I can actually play this game or not.  __label__39
<Laughter> {C And } I'm, {F uh, } certainly was surprised [ to, + {F uh, } to ] hear from you.   __label__39
{C So, } - __label__0
Yeah,   __label__11
They're producing, {F uh, } similar music   __label__40
I ((think)) government does a better space program -- __label__40
Yeah,   __label__7
I worked with Spanish people -- __label__39
Did you, {F uh, } -  __label__37
Yeah,   __label__11
I just started picking up books   __label__39
-- {D you know, }  of course there's still a lot of work to be done,   __label__39
A school administrator.  __label__2
{C but } every weekend a small town will sponsor a rally   __label__39
<Laughter> {D Well, } {F uh. } - __label__0
{C but, } {D you know, } it's, an, -  __label__39
{C And } we are going to consider ourselves against, in war, __label__5
doing that.   __label__1
I think that Discover Card has a good idea with, {D you know, } giving you a little cash back incentive for each amount [ you, + you ] purchase.  As long as you don't go crazy trying to get cash back.  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
[ I, + {F uh, } when I ] first moved down here, moved into the apartment and got cable,  [ and + ] I guess I [ sort of, + kind of ] became numb.  __label__39
If they chose not to, that's acceptable.  __label__40
{C and } with that type person running it, {E I mean, } [ you, + you ] could expect that you, - __label__40
but it's still a little cramped.   __label__40
Yeah.   __label__31
# mandatory # drug testing, we'll reduce your insurance costs by, __label__1
The cat was here first   __label__16
Yeah,   __label__31
{F Uh, } she, {F uh, } -  __label__0
-- too,   __label__1
It's where we originally started out,   __label__39
{C But, } they like, {F uh, } spaghetti.  __label__39
[ {C but, } + __label__0
# {C but, } # {D you know, } [ I, + I ] just look forward to him helping me out because  (( ))  I for years just car, __label__39
I don't think [ anyb-, +  # any ] # -- - __label__40
{C But } I'd want to be with a skilled sailor <laughter>.  __label__39
# I think, {F uh, } I find myself getting my little projects going and not taking the time that I should <laughter>.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F Uh, } I get kind of bored watching T V actually, when I watch the news on T V because -- __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
I think we've collected stuff off and on over the years.   __label__39
That is what people say.  __label__39
she needed that, __label__37
{C and } one of my daughters has one   __label__39
[ The, + the ] last one we did,  {A and we haven't had a chance to duplicate } [ was, + {F uh, } was ] a canoe trip in Arkansas   __label__39
It has, - __label__0
Do you have # a family?  __label__37
Probably,  __label__0
[ Goin-, ke-, + <throat_clearing> he was going to keep ]  him as the coach somehow,   __label__39
yeah, #  __label__0
[ {C and, } + {C and }  ] we enjoyed that,   __label__39
If they could get away with it <laughter>.  __label__2
[ I, + I'm ] a diver   __label__39
On my mother's side we've had several,   __label__26
Sure.  __label__26
they thought that was so hysterical.  __label__39
# Yeah,   __label__7
They can come from all over the city,   __label__39
yeah,   __label__11
{C But } I just think [ our, + our  ] family lives have changed <noise> drastically.  __label__40
right,   __label__7
# {C And } [ they, + they ] turned # out really cute.   __label__39
That's true.  __label__7
Right.  __label__11
the only way you could use them is if you were,  {D like } on vacation.   __label__39
[ {C So, } + {C or } ] I give it to my Mom and Dad if I know we're # not # -- __label__39
I think they're made out of aluminum,  __label__39
{C and } none of them are [ our, + our ] alma mater   __label__39
# Okay. #   __label__14
{F Uh, } if you're healthy it's fine,   __label__40
{D Well, } we're on totally different wavelengths.  __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
<Beep> <TV> <Children> First of all, I want to tell you  I have two little kids,   __label__39
yeah.   __label__7
yeah.   __label__31
{F Oh, } that's great.  __label__13
We were not really happy with, __label__39
[ That's, + <laughter> that's ] one of those interesting pieces of trivia that somebody said,  did you notice that?  __label__37
{C And } she told me what she had  requested.    __label__39
Do you work with T I?   __label__37
I can't remember his name.   __label__39
{C and } the creek was just wild, just running.   __label__39
{C But, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } that whole Biblical concept like [ that, + <noise> <<sounds like telephone>> that's ] true in  a lot of our, -  __label__40
{C and } [ they, + they ] have {D like } [ little, + little ] boxes that you can put your old bags in.  __label__39
-- the Centigrade -- __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F Oh, } really?  __label__17
{D well, } [  I, + I ] think we have exhausted my pitifully small knowledge -- __label__39
{C And, }  {F uh, } men, {F uh, } [ have, +   a lot of them have, ] {F uh, } come around and have seen, __label__40
{D Well } that's one thing I  like about the Spring Creek place.   __label__39
I do.  __label__26
[ they had, + they had ] purchased it, -  __label__39
{C but } [ it's not, + it's not ] what I want to spend it on, {D you know. }  __label__39
{C and  they, {F uh, } -  __label__0
Which, again, I think is the way it is now. That [ all the, + all ] verdicts, -  __label__1
{C but } [ I, + I ] guess you wouldn't.   __label__40
[ {C and } + {C and } ] it puts me right up-to-date [ what I'm, + what I  have to do, ] what I have to ship, what I should be expecting to be returned.  __label__39
you should put ten to fifteen percent of your monthly bring home -- __label__8
Yeah.  __label__11
{F Oh, } you are --  __label__17
-- {F uh, } particularly [ solicit-, + {D you know, } soliciting. ]   __label__1
{E I mean, } {D you know, } they lay me off,   __label__39
I play {D like } Old Maid and  Fish with them,   __label__39
-- {C but, } {D you know, } if I had to make the choice again, [ [ I, + {D yeah, } I, ] +  I'm ] perfectly happy with what I decided -- __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
really.  __label__7
Yeah,   __label__11
{C And } another quick dish if you like, {F um, } do you know what hoi sin sauce is,    *[[two utts?]] __label__39
{C and } you listen to the oldies.  __label__16
Hey I got long hair,   __label__39
See that's something in Minneapolis  they're really strict on.   __label__39
-- [ I, +  {D you know, } # I'm ] not # -- __label__39
You want to do the one who can do the most good.  __label__40
Yeah,   __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
Yep.  __label__11
{C But } what really annoys me is the way we, in the United States, have been converting to metric.   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
And [ he wou-, + <laughter> he wound ] up pull, - __label__39
that effects the budget especially around, {F uh, } Christmas time   __label__40
{F Huh? }  __label__19
# Uh-huh.   __label__11
{F Oh, } I see.  __label__11
to get them to, {F uh, } come to the, {D you know, } the correct decade here and  century.   __label__1
# Uh-huh. #  __label__11
# [ {C So. } + # __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
boy,   __label__13
# Uh-huh.  #  __label__11
I like that, too.  __label__7
# {D You # know, } __label__39
[ Y-, +  {D so } you're ] saying  [ yo-, +  you ] think the judge should actually have the final say?  __label__16
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I couldn't even hear what you were saying,   __label__39
{C but, } __label__14
Isn't that great?  __label__17
no.   __label__7
{D Well, } see last year we had snow at Christmas time.  __label__39
{C And, }  {F um, } I don't know from my own experience,  {F um, }   __label__39
When you start seeing what all they can do for you.  __label__40
{C And } -- __label__39
-- dogs, I guess,   __label__1
Sure.  __label__11
course, there are mountains,   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
-- in the future <<faint>>.   __label__1
{D so } that's about it.  __label__22
{F Oh, } yeah.  __label__11
{C So, } I'm still using a three iron   __label__39
I knew something was wrong with him because his appetite was, -  __label__39
[ It, + it's ] about twenty  of his greatest hits on it.   __label__39
And the Ambassador said, yes.   __label__39
{C and } the one thing that she ended up with [ is, + was ] the old door, __label__39
{F Oh, } that's great.   __label__13
Yeah.   __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Is that right?   __label__17
It's, {F uh, } part Chow and part Shepherd   __label__39
of ] that group.  <sigh>   __label__1
# {C So. } # It's, -  __label__0
{C So } [ you kne-, + you know ] the atmosphere, then.  __label__38
[ [ I'm, + I'm, ] + I'm ] hoping, I'm hoping.  __label__39
Right.  __label__11
[ I don-, + we don't  ] get to the video store very often   __label__39
Okay.  __label__14
{C and } I had a meeting with the,  {F uh, } vice principal and the English instructor,   __label__39
# Right.  #  __label__11
{F Huh. }  __label__0
<Lipsmack> Okay,   __label__14
{D You know, } the Schnauzers are a little aggressive.  __label__40
Yes   __label__22
Yeah,   __label__11
{D well, } [ we like, +  {F uh, }  lots of people down here like ] Mexican food --  __label__40
I do think we should deal more with them.   __label__40
my son is certainly not persuaded of that <<pause>>.   __label__39
they haven't gone down.   __label__39
{C and } [ then + now ] we make a point of watching <laughter>.   __label__39
{D Well. } - __label__0
{E I mean } I can just get so, __label__39
Which I was kind of leaning toward anyway,  to tell you the truth.  __label__9
I have switched schools  several times because [ I, + [ di-, + ] I ] really didn't care for what was going on at that the school.   __label__39
{F Oh, } now we really get sick <laughter>.  __label__40
-- or like the news, because they would always have {D like } the wonderful investigative reports, {D you know, } is you're kids bus driver smoking crack, __label__1
{F Oh, } really.   __label__11
# <Laughter>.  # __label__43
# {E I # mean } [ I like, + {D you know, } I like ] Costner,   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh,   __label__11
[ They don't, + they don't ]  even start growing until [ May, + __label__39
{C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } colds and things like that <laughter> get -- __label__39
Yeah   __label__11
me either.  __label__1
that's for sure.  __label__40
{C and so } I hardly ever have anybody that wins that I vote for <laughter>.  __label__39
We had. - __label__0
Right.  __label__11
{F Oh, } {C so } you pressed one?  __label__37
Fish is pretty good for you,   __label__39
{C But } there's always a sale.  __label__40
I just couldn't handle [ the, + the ] amount of them we got this year.   __label__39
{F Oh } <breathing>.  {D Well, } that's the way to do it.  __label__40
It'll go underneath the car instead.  __label__39
{D Well, } {F uh, } maybe they should, -  __label__40
{C And then } [ I just, + {F uh, } {D you know, } I just ] broil it and put lemon on it.  __label__39
{C because, } {F uh, } I'm a retired educator.  __label__39
{C But } I do think, {F um, } {D you know, } {D like } the current trends are that, {F um, } the family unit is devaluated.   __label__40
{C and } fifty percent of the population is minority.  __label__39
{C and, } {F uh, } I was, {F uh, } fortunate not to have to serve in the theater,   __label__39
-- right.  __label__1
{C and, so } it's just really, really well regulated.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
[ I'm, + I'm ] not ready to buy a new car yet,   __label__39
Uh-huh.   __label__11
{F Uh, } for instance, {F uh, } {D well, } {D you know, }  I am just not taken as seriously, {D you know, } __label__39
<Sniffing>. __label__43
I'm writing it down.   __label__39
Yes.  __label__11
{F Uh, } {D you know, } {E I mean, } certainly [ there, + there ] are cases [ of, + ] [ of, + ] {D you know, } children who find their parents' gun or something [ and, + and ] shoot a brother or sister or, {D you know, } things like that that need to be definitely avoided   __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C And } the lightning was almost continuous, just, {F uh, } {D you know, } as if you put your hand on one of those electric, {F uh, } things that causes lightning.  __label__39
{C but } it's, {F uh, } changing latitude.  __label__39
# Uh-huh.  #  __label__11
[ I think, + I think ] it, - __label__0
{D you know } [ we + basically  the Panama Canal we ] went in [ {C and, } + {C and } ] took it.  __label__40
Are, are, __label__37
[ {C and, } +  {C and } ] the other one was country.  __label__39
{F Oh, } no.  __label__1
On [ [ this, + this thing that I'm, ] + this survey ] or whatever, {D you know, } [ this -- + ] __label__39
I knew [ that one of the, + that ] Nissan which is Toyota [ had, {F uh, } joined with, + had ] a plant over here.   __label__39
{C and } <sigh> large areas of the forest are being hurt from the cars because when we, [ s-, + {F uh, } switched ] to the unleaded gas [ and, + and ] had the emission control [ advice, + {F uh, } <laughter>, devices ] required on the cars, {F uh, }   __label__39
yeah,   __label__7
That's true too.  __label__7
{C But, }  it is frightening   __label__40
we all live in southern California   __label__39
{C so, } {F uh, } we tend to, __label__39
because [ [ y-, + you, ] + you've ] got [ all, + all ] the prison expenses, plus all the legal expenses.  __label__39
Right.  __label__11
{F Uh, } {C but } that hasn't been adopted very widely.  __label__39
I think that's kind of when my husband hit the roof, __label__39
Yeah,   __label__7
Right.   __label__7
I know some people who have twenty-five years and thirty and they want more   __label__39
{C  so } maybe that part of it would be helpful too.  __label__40
{C so } it's nice [ to, + to ] get away.   __label__39
# to # quit my job so I could stay home with her the next five months, __label__1
{C But } fortunately that was covered under the warranty.  __label__39
{D Well, } I think part of the problem comes in sort of shoddy workmanship.   __label__40
{C and } sometimes I think you may be more productive if you're comfortable with what your wearing and can [ [ be, + be, ] + feel ] more relaxed.    *[[slash needed]] __label__40
{C and } I was very very protective on who baby-sat my children.  __label__39
[ You  + ((   ))  you ]  would not be pulling it out of your account all of the time -- __label__16
{E I mean, } {C but, }  [ I, + I ] hate for them to make people feel bad that have to work, too, saying, {D you know, } you should stay home, {D you know, } otherwise your children aren't going to, {D you know, } turn out, or whatever -- __label__40
-- {C and } you expect them to do their job   __label__39
It didn't blow up or anything <laughter>.  __label__39
# {C but } # I don't think that [ they're going, + they're going ] to change that,   __label__40
Why is that?   __label__35
I don't, {F uh. } - __label__0
{D Well, } __label__39
{D well, } [ I, + I ] grew up in Panama City.  __label__39
huh-uh.   __label__29
[ {C so } +  {C and } ] she was going  to sell her car because she didn't need it anymore   __label__39
I don't know,   __label__25
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Sure.  __label__11
{F Uh, }  you have, {D you know, } major, {F um, } acupuncture schools and things out here.   __label__39
Detroit's in [ that same, + {F uh, }  [ that, + that ] same, ] {F uh, } division.  __label__39
it is temporary.   __label__7
[ I, +  I ] saw the previews.  __label__39
{C and } I do that type of stuff typically for other people,   __label__39
I think they get bogged down in  a lot of small issues that [ people, +  {D you know, } special interest groups ] can blow up, __label__40
Is that right?   __label__37
# By # firing squad, as I recall.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I imagine that they have, {F uh, } [ some, + ] a lot of homework, too.  __label__39
{C and then } again, I understand why they can't dig too much deeper,   __label__39
Edge finders and ... - __label__0
you're the first, {D you know, } {F uh, } -  __label__39
<Smack> {D Well, } it's really a <smack> -  __label__39
# Uh-huh.  #  __label__11
It is such an honor and a thrill, __label__39
Okay.  __label__11
what a coincidence.  __label__40
<laughter>. __label__43
Yeah,   __label__7
[ {C So } + {C but, } ] - __label__0
I just want out.  __label__5
let's see <laughter>,   __label__4
You just sit down [ on -- + __label__39
-- {F uh, } I don't always succeed at that.   __label__39
In fact, on  weeknights they are in bed by eight,   __label__39
-- and then welcome written on those little wooden hearts.  __label__1
She had a rather massive stroke [ about, + {F uh, } about ] -- __label__39
{C And } we kind of got spoiled.  __label__39
{C And, } {F um, } {D actually } there's one, {F um, } woman in our, {A I don't know what you'd call it, } {F uh, } institute who is a manager   __label__39
you have these people who are serial killers that didn't even get the death sentence back when -- __label__39
{C and } we had nothing taken because we  knew   __label__39
{C And } they are very, very good at what they do.   __label__39
I've seen those.   __label__39
{C And } in civil law there, {D you know, } is such a thing as {D like, } let's say, {F uh, } <breathing> misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that.   __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
[ [ We, + we-, ] + I ]  had one [ [ that had, + we had, ] + we had ] to put to sleep he got so sick.  __label__39
okay.  __label__18
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and } we think that was real good --  __label__39
yeah,   __label__0
I am sure I will.   __label__22
{E I mean, } all this recycling used to be in tact,    *[[typo in tact should be 'intact']] __label__40
No.   __label__7
[ {C and, } +  {C and } ]  I know for a fact that the transmission is made by Mitsubishi.  __label__39
Absolutely,  __label__7
Right.  __label__11
# {C But, } {F uh, } here again, you get back into a political thing, where, {F uh, } # - __label__40
{F Oh, } [ d-, + definitely.  ]   __label__7
{E I mean, } [ [ it, + it  ] +  definitely it's  ] not at a level comparable to Los Angeles or Denver   __label__39
Yeah, #   __label__11
{D Well, } he said he learned so much   __label__39
{D Well, } of course, being raised  on the water I'd never swim in it.  __label__39
Yeah <laughter>.  __label__11
{D Well, } {F oh, } from a woman's point of view  [ and + ] it was very, {F uh, } chauvinistic as far as women go.   __label__40
{C and } you didn't have all the other junk around it,  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yes --  __label__31
I live out in the country,   __label__39
I went to a language school,   __label__39
<Laughter> Yeah,   __label__11
# Uh-huh.  #  __label__11
{C and } you want to correct those.   __label__5
-- {D you know. }  __label__1
which is the, sort of  (( O strip ))    east to west, eastern part,   __label__1
[ She's got so many flow-, + she's got just a gorgeous yard, so many, {F uh, } flowers ]  and [ her, + her ] four cats, {D you know, }   __label__39
{C and, }  {F uh, } I have a friend,  __label__39
I wonder though <laughter>. #  __label__9
Everybody pretty much [ [ kee-, + keeps-, ] + keeps ] to their own turf, so to speak.  __label__38
{F Oh, } my goodness, these guys, [ they, + __label__4
{C But } I never thought of it really as a reunion.  __label__39
((   )) . __label__43
{F Oh, } {D well } this is my first one.  __label__39
#  ((   ))  [ e-, + ] right.  #  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__11
Yeah,   __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
{C but, } __label__14
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and } I work with those same people all those nine years,   __label__39
-- {C and } it's so simple, because  I can pop it in when I come in the door, {D you know, } and then, {F uh, }  go about my business,   __label__39
[ we, + {D well, } we ]  have quite a few   __label__39
yeah.  __label__31
Oh!  __label__13
{D Well, } I spent six years in  graduate school [ at, + in  ] Indiana.  In the flatlands,   __label__39
Uh-huh <throat_clearing>.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I have a school of five hundred and thirty-seven kids.  __label__39
somewhat that,   __label__40
Insurance cases and things like that.  __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh,   __label__7
Right.   __label__7
Yeah,   __label__7
At least maybe some of these mountain  bikes you could   __label__40
{C and } I don't like, -  __label__39
You save a lot.  __label__40
{C And, } the first five minutes  or ten minutes of the movie [ was, + I was ] very well persuaded to walk out.   Very well persuaded,   __label__39
{C but, } <laughter> it is, {D you know, } -  __label__0
{F Oh, } I'll have to look for those.  __label__20
Yeah.  __label__11
{C but, } [ there, + I think there ] are a lot of other things I would have liked better.  __label__39
if you really want it.  __label__1
{C or, } __label__39
{C and, } {F uh, } the main crimes within the suburb here are [ the, + the  ] theft crimes. __label__39
{C Because } my husband will leave every once in a while, __label__39
I'm not trying to make big bulging muscles, __label__39
<<Person in the background replies>>  (( Where at? )) .   __label__42
Yeah.  __label__11
{C And, so } that's how I got <meow> involved.  __label__39
{C And, } {F uh, } __label__39
what is it?  __label__35
{C but } I suspect it would work.   __label__40
{C So, } {D you know, }  I really have to try to budget, that I don't go over that amount, {D you know, } each month.  __label__39
{C and } it amounted to, {F uh, } going in, {F uh, } before any of these interviews,   __label__39
{C so } )) . - __label__0
Yeah.  __label__11
{D Well } __label__8
[ {C and, } + __label__39
-- {C so, }  I don't know,   __label__25
they learn how many centimeters are in an inch   __label__16
{D You know, } [ the accid-, + the accidental ] fee or the car repair or the things that weren't supposed to be every month.  __label__40
{C so } I never did get into them.   __label__39
{C and } everybody hates it,   __label__39
I don't know if you read Skip Bayless, [ but -- + ] __label__38
Uh-huh.  __label__11
not my kneecap.  __label__39
{C So } <laughter>. - __label__0
-- {C and } [ I was, + I was ] there this, {F uh, } summer   __label__39
{D Well, } not really because usually it's when we go off, __label__28
You think you're getting your money's worth?  __label__37
-- <Laughter> right out the window.   __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C And then } even my eleven year old boy loves to listen to it.  __label__39
yeah.  __label__11
{C So, } {F uh, } yeah,   __label__11
[ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C and so, } ] {D you know, } [ [ we, +  we ] don't,  + there's lots of things that we don't ] get told. For good reason.   __label__39
{C So, } [ I, + I ] can see the advantage to that one.   __label__39
{C So } I haven't really paid that much attention {D like, } since back in August when all of the news and all of the media began to focus in on, {F uh, } Iraq,   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
and we were in the retail milk business   __label__39
uh-huh.  __label__31
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and } that's what's causing all the killing.  __label__40
{C So, } [ it's, + it's ] pretty quiet.  {D You know, }   __label__39
I was worried --  __label__39
{D Well, } I saw a program [ on, + {F uh, } recently, ]   __label__39
The only thing really that can be changed is for [ us to, + everybody to ] say, we've had enough of you, out you go.   __label__40
You are.  __label__17
Yeah,   __label__1
What I also think that, -  __label__0
{C because } I'm down at N C State.  __label__39
-- something,  which I think is, unfortunate for that person -- __label__1
{C but } we do have a awful lot of snakes in our lakes.  __label__39
{D Well, } yeah,   __label__31
[ an, + an ] incredible foreign policy coup on the part of the President and  the State Department.  __label__1
Yeah.   __label__7
# {C so } my # next trip is going to be to Texas <laughter>.  __label__39
and <breathing> for every fifty dollars he'd have to go in and check with the boss   __label__39
My mother's a school teacher   __label__39
Yeah.   __label__7
Yeah.  __label__11
{F Uh, } that's true.   __label__7
yeah,   __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
then those in turn got a hold of these other ones.  __label__39
{C so } back to boats.  __label__8
{C and } I sit and watch for a few minutes   __label__39
-- not done it in a while.   __label__1
I think that would probably be a good way to catch catfish,   __label__40
{D Well, } {F um, } <laughter> [ I don't have that, + I don't have that ] <<both are laughing>>, experience to share <laughter>.  __label__39
How about you?  __label__33
[ he, + he ] to me is not a center,   __label__40
{C so. } - __label__0
Right.  __label__26
# with, # {F uh, } forty-five minute commute into the city, and a forty-five commute home,   __label__1
seems like every time somebody's on the bank, all they want to do is throw it out just as far as they can -- __label__40
{D well } if we can just destroy the market by destroying the demand -  __label__40
{F Oh, } gosh.  __label__13
{C But, } yeah,   __label__11
<laughter> __label__43
{C and } it, -  __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
#  ((   ))  push paper around. #  __label__2
That, -  __label__0
{D You know? } - __label__37
# fact. #  __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
what do you use yours at home for?  __label__33
should begin.  *[[listen; could probably code if we could tell if it said "we" or "you"]] __label__14
{E I mean, } cause he's always, {D you know, } -  __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
{C but } we don't farm much,   __label__39
[ They, + {C and, }  {D well, }  [ [ they had, + {D well, } they had, ] + they had ] ] seen it coming.  __label__39
-- {C but, }  {F uh, } - __label__0
Yeah.  __label__11
{F uh. }   Yes,   __label__31
I'm kind of embarrassed  I'm talking to a man, cause I'm sure that [ you are, + you play ]  a lot more than I do.  __label__39
T I, I see.  __label__18
Absolutely.   __label__26
I want to have a relationship with her.   __label__39
like I'm loaded,   __label__39
{D Oh } yeah,   __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D You know, } stealing the hundred dollar jackets.   __label__39
{C And } [ they, + they've ] started some  recycling campaigns that  a year before that had been turned down because they said, {D Well, } it's not feasible,  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{C So, }  {F uh, }  [ [ I, +  I, ] + I ] still think the exposure was good.  __label__39
{D you know, }   __label__1
If they get some of those mega awards against them.   __label__1
{C but, } [ if + ] it captures some of [ the, + the ] feeling I have from the people making business decisions that if they failed it's sort of {D well } no skin of my back   __label__40
{D Actually, } it's my son,   __label__39
{C But } I'm plagued with those things,  __label__39
{D Well, } where is it,   __label__0
short term is, to get things going   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__18
{C And, } of course, there are people in the  big cities who would [ do, + ] like nothing better than to take advantage of them.  __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D Well, } {D you know } [ he was, + {A when was it, last year or year before last, } he was ] voted the sexiest actor in movies, __label__39
What we do, usually, is, {F uh, }  vote, {F uh, } absenteeism --  __label__39
up for me.  __label__1
[ there are, + there are ] lots of bike paths.   __label__39
{F Um, } I consider that a hobby.   __label__39
Yeah <laughter>.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
# {C and # then } they go into a lot of the issues and -- __label__39
Definitely,   __label__7
{C but } <laughter>, - __label__0
Do you?  __label__17
{C So } it's not, {D you know, } -  __label__0
-- they weren't ] any criminal.  __label__1
# Yeah,   __label__11
{C So then } it becomes, {F uh, } more realistic.  __label__40
Okay,   __label__7
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
A growing part.  __label__2
{C or, } - __label__0
That's right.  __label__7
I see.  __label__22
[ {C so, } + __label__39
# {D Well, } # __label__14
No  __label__7
{C and } a lot of work went into a lot of that,   __label__40
How many do you have?  __label__35
[ [ I, + I tend to, ] + {F uh, } I ] get teased by my family a lot, because, {F uh, } I like  experimenting [ on, + on ] food   __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
{F Uh, } it must have been six.  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__0
{D So, } I don't know, {F um, } {D you know, }   __label__25
{C And } I think that would be a great idea, because I think they do, [ come, + become ] less aware,   __label__40
# Yeah. #  __label__11
no,   __label__15
{C But } he's not a gardener.   __label__39
Yeah   __label__11
-- drive or wherever we, -  __label__1
# I guess # that's kind of like the way we do.   __label__39
though, um, um, -  __label__0
Yeah.  __label__11
from Dallas.   __label__1
I'm not real sure.  __label__25
they shouldn't catch themselves in that circumstance anyway.   __label__40
I think, I -  __label__0
{C and then } the next time I go it's the same thing, {D you know, } __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{C And } I was like, {F oh, } I want to go home <laughter>. __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Boy,   __label__13
{C but, } __label__39
Yeah.   __label__11
An-, -  __label__0
{C So, }  it's pretty nice.   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__7
{C and } we use to [ go, + go ] out to that about once a week.  __label__39
{C And } there are people, literally that everyday, take the ferry, {D you know, } and drive, __label__39
{D you know, } I think they have enough people [ [ who are, + who are, ] + who are ] still in their prime, {D you know. }  __label__39
it's amazing how your whole focus on life changes after you've had a child.  __label__40
Really bad.  __label__13
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F um, } like I said they're doing extremely good right now.   __label__1
Uh-huh <<faint>>.  __label__11
<<Very faint>> {F oh, } yeah.   __label__11
I housesat  (( from ))  cats  for a friend of mine which she was finishing up her thesis,  __label__39
-- passion, {F huh. }  __label__1
yeah,  __label__0
In fact, {F uh, } <breathing> [ just a little over, + just a little less ] than a year ago, {F uh, } my mother <talking> went to be with the Lord,   __label__39
-- and there across the street one of the apartments blew up because they were having that, making that, um, crack stuff --  __label__39
# Sometimes it isn't. #   __label__2
[ [ I, +  {F uh, } I, ] + I ]  guess what bothers me [ is, +  is ] that when you go, {F um, } you wait and wait and wait   __label__39
{C So } you never know [ what, + what ] may occur,   __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D So, } - __label__0
[  I, + I ] do.   __label__7
-- have ] done hyacinths.   __label__1
thing [ is, +  is, ]  that, {D you know, } {D like } [ if, +  if ] they would ever happen to have a drug problem, suppose, that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying, I got a problem -- __label__40
Right.  __label__11
I'm not either.  __label__39
I know.   __label__7
{C or } was, __label__34
{C and } we took it back   __label__39
I'm trying to get my career going.   __label__39
{C So } they can't stop people from, {F uh, } advertising   __label__39
{C Because } I know personally myself, I've been in the same job for three years,   __label__39
[ What, + what ] attracts you to the Saturns?   __label__35
Yeah,   __label__11
{F Oh, } you do, {F huh. }   __label__13
like that because they say it's not safe to put those things, __label__1
Right.  __label__11
[ I do, + I do ] like to go to movies,   __label__39
[ [ [ Some, + some  places, {F um, } start them as early as, I think, ] + {D well, } some, ] + some places ] take them as infants, I guess, {D you know, } like eight weeks, even.  __label__39
[ I'm, + I'm ] sure you do.   __label__40
Yeah.  __label__11
[ are you, + do you ] like the heat in the summer then when it gets up in the nineties and hundreds.  __label__37
{C And, then, } at the end of, {F uh, }  school year they would be tested   __label__39
{F Oh, } uh-huh.  __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I -- __label__39
{C and } I got up   __label__39
{C and } I'm like, {D you know, } __label__39
{C and } it was a lease car   __label__39
# Uh-huh. #  __label__11
{C But } it's a really nice, {F uh, } change of pace.  __label__39
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ]  {F uh, } they all share the same kitchen and dining room and den and  kitchen.   __label__39
Huh.  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__12
{D you know, } {C and } he wants to be an engineer,   __label__39
Really?  __label__17
[ I, + I ] think that {D like } girls today, have children,  __label__40
{D Well }  ((   ))  any number is nice, let me tell you.  __label__40
It is about a lot of men, {D you know, }  [ all right, + ] going through divorces.   __label__39
# {E I mean, } {F uh. } # - __label__0
it's in Garland where all the bad weather is.   __label__39
{C And } I couldn't believe it and the tax, {D you know, }  really hits you.   *[[ both kinds of slash error; Should be 2 slash units, I think ]] __label__39
{C and } it goes around, __label__40
we take the kids to the park,   __label__39
--  ((   )) . __label__43
-- I can do, {D you know, } watching T V or whatever   __label__1
was not a heavy user of any S and Ls   __label__1
right.  __label__11
{F Um, } I've had an opening day on Monday.  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{C And, } of course, I doubt if there's  any, -  __label__39
plug it in.  __label__1
[ I, + I'm ] guess it's falling back into our traditional stereotype which a lot of shows -- - __label__40
# From # the lack of stimulation, # you mean. #  __label__16
Right.  __label__11
{C and } [ they're, + {D you know, } they're ] just doing a [ lot of, +  {F uh, } lot of ] stuff.  __label__39
And, uh, and now they are saying well maybe in the right conditions,   __label__39
{F Uh, }  (( as far as, )) -  __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
# Oh.  #  __label__11
{C and } normally when they call, you're either in the shower,   __label__14
Things that need to be done, __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__7
They're just horrid --  __label__40
# {C So } what they are # asking you to tell them is all the prescription drugs you are taking which are controlled substances.  __label__16
I try to fool everybody # <laughter>. #  __label__39
[ [ it + that's ] + {F uh } that's ] what I mean,   __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D Well, } I thought was funny that they kept pushing the three eighty-six S X even though [ the, + the ] price difference is about ten dollars.  __label__39
Right.  __label__11
I remember he was {D like } a backup   __label__39
-- franchised restaurants.   __label__1
{C but } it's the industrial pollution I should imagine.  __label__40
(( God )) , I'm envious <laughter>.  __label__13
Yeah,   __label__7
Yeah, {F uh, }   __label__11
What branch were you in?  __label__35
#Yeah.#   __label__11
I think everywhere they just need to sit down and hire some people,  the grunts, as I call them, like  myself <laughter>  -- __label__40
<Laughter> Yeah --  __label__7
{C so } I'll probably just wear -- __label__39
Because, how, -  __label__0
{D well, } no   __label__10
that's once a month.  __label__39
{C So } I went out and played substitute for a while and decided, nope, not for me.  __label__39
we'll see you in four years.  __label__5
{C but, } {F uh, } - __label__0
It was nice talking to you.   __label__22
{C and, } {F um, } maybe we'll talk again.  __label__22
-- it's out of Kansas -- __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
[ If I had kids, + {D well } if you had kids, ] what kind of  things do you hope to do? <Noise> <<sounds like paper rustling>>.  __label__33
Definitely <talking>.  __label__7
A personal trial and the reporter was asking a [ stup-, + ]  stupid question of the people outside.   *[[ Shouldn't the continued statement end after "A personal trial" and a new slash unit begin? ]] __label__1
Yeah.  __label__11
Yeah.  __label__0
#which# if anyone has ever been involved in that, some days it's fun   __label__40
{C But, } {D you know, }  <laughter> it gets annoying when they stand right over you watching everything you do.  __label__40
{C So } -- __label__40
Yeah.  __label__11
And then people, the, the wrong people will just fight their way <noise>  up to the top again,   __label__40
{C And } {E I mean } [ the, +  the ] technology's not that hard.   __label__40
{D like } [ during, + especially during ] my undergrad.  __label__1
[ {C but, } +  {C but } ] Kentucky's beautiful.   __label__40
Of course, that's not supposed to be <laughter> what we're talking about today, I guess.   __label__39
Yes.  __label__7
And what you read to them.   __label__1
# Yeah.  #  __label__11
Dinner. - __label__1
There you go.  __label__7
{D Yeah, } they say, it's,  __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C And, } {F uh, } then we have, {D you know, } -  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
<Laughter> He does,   __label__39
{D Well, } [ the way, + it seems the way ]  it's been working here's, - __label__39
[ Tex-, + Tarrant County Junior College. ]  __label__39
Okay,   __label__18
an, -  __label__0
{C but } I'm not interested because we're moving out of the house next year.  __label__39
{C And, }  {F uh, } they will rent a pavilion on a weekend,   __label__39
[ [ {C And } I, + {C and } I, ] + {C and } I'm ] saying to myself, {D well, } {D you know, } [ y-, + you ] dump [ [ your, + your, ] + your ] little turnip off to, {F uh, } {D you know, } this child care place   __label__39
[ [ It, +  {F uh, }   unfortunately I guess for myself it  wasn't, ] +    {F uh, } it was ] purely by my own choice.   __label__39
[ That's what it, + that's what ] -- - __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F Oh, } {F oh, } goody.  __label__13
[ {C and, } + __label__11
-- have a good weekend.  __label__22
Uh-huh.   __label__31
For instance, that, -  __label__1
I think that's a nice gesture,  on the Kuwaiti government part to do that,   __label__40
Especially, {D you know, } if you catch yourself short on cash or if you're on vacation, __label__40
Oh.  __label__11
Are you looking in the paper?  __label__37
There's never anything for you to go to trial as a witness in a case like that. __label__40
It seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks, {D you know, } that get into the system.  __label__40
I lost fifteen pounds just by doing that  because you tighten your stomach muscles --  __label__39
It was one thing.   __label__39
Enjoy your, {F uh, } weekend.  __label__22
{F Uh, } PRESUMED INNOCENT?  __label__37
{C so, } - __label__0
right --  __label__3
{D Well, } I lived across the street  almost from Canada <laughter>.  __label__39
-- {C and, }  {F uh, } the only thing I have against it in that's it's a Taurus,   __label__39
-- and, ] {F uh, } be more formal because I had [ a, + a ] formal meeting at noon time,   __label__1
-- {D you know. }   __label__1
I was born in New Mexico   __label__39
{C so } this is a  change.  __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
that seemed to be the # place to be # -- __label__40
[ I, + I ] question us, {D you know, } now,   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C And } do you # have to sort that? #  __label__37
My, {F uh, } roommate does sew  some   __label__39
[ All the, + {F uh, } the one ] with the two little girls in it, what's it called.  __label__39
<Throat_clearing>.  __label__43
{C and }  [ I, + I ] just feel like, {D you know, } <noise> you have to constantly <noise> weigh yourself -- __label__40
Seems like most of ours are occurring in late at night [ or, + or, ] like I say, drug related.   __label__39
{C And } nowadays [ [ you, + you'll ] get, + you'll get ] a dog trainer to recommend a specific, {D you know, } breeder handler.   __label__39
you've got to really strike a balance in [ what kind of care, + what kind of level of care ] you need, and then [ what you can, + unfortunately what you can ] afford at the same time.  __label__40
[  It, + it ] turned out to be [ a, + a ] Chrysler.  {F Uh } <lipsmack>, Lancer.  __label__39
{D well, } families are facing a challenge,   __label__40
I have got to try and get out there.   __label__39
{C and, } most of the body parts seem  to be metric,   __label__39
Uh-huh,   __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F oh, } I would too.    __label__7
{F Uh, } and never seeing, {F uh, } {D you know, } light, bright days, {D you know. }   __label__1
{C and } [ they put him in the nursery, + {F uh, } they put him in the nurse's office. ]  __label__39
Okay,   __label__22
Okay,   __label__14
Do they do it, {D like, } {D you know, } within hours of the <<pause>> accident,   __label__37
-- # Mexico? #  __label__1
Yeah.  __label__11
it was, {D yeah, } in some of the critical things, like [ the off-, + special investigations, ] at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person,   __label__39
{D Well } [ are they going to beat, +   are they going to beat ] Oakland?  __label__37
{C And } that's [ the way, + the course ] that  they should go,   __label__40
{D Well, } sure it does.   __label__7
It was really nice so <<very faint>>,  __label__39
Exactly.   __label__7
{F Uh, } I'm of the age that could have gone, although I didn't   __label__39
Right.  __label__11
<Laughter>  {F Oh, } really.   __label__11
{C But, }  {F um, }  [ those  law-, + those lawns ] look nice during the winter,   __label__39
{C but } it's stays pretty cold even, {F uh, } during the Winter, for as nice as it is.  __label__39
-- for job hiring   __label__1
Yeah,   __label__22
I guess that's where they stay [ in, + {F uh, } in, ] -  __label__40
Okay.  __label__18
there was no feeling of accomplishment, no goal,   __label__40
Yeah,   __label__11
<laughter> Like fishing and ... - __label__16
they have H M O, which, {D you know, } after you get used to it, it's not too bad,   __label__40
Yeah.  __label__11
{C and } I'm enjoying it.   __label__39
Yes,   __label__11
what I do watch is, {F uh, } usually news and whatever is on public television.   __label__39
Yeah.   __label__11
{C and } they're fixing to go to Disneyland.   __label__39
I have [ a, + a ] tape collection that I like to listen to, {F uh, } cassette tapes --  __label__39
-- from those yellow legal pads, then.  __label__1
-- {F oh, } dear, it was just awful.  __label__40
{C and } I decided I'd take my friend over and show him the dog,   __label__39
[ {D act-, } th-, + {D actually } that  ]  was just [ a, + [ at, + at  ]  ] the beginning of September  __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
Yeah,   __label__31
uh-huh. #  __label__11
-- that's ] the way the world, {F uh, } {D you know, } revolves that way <lipsmack>.   __label__1
{F um, } <lipsmack> Congress has added too towards the Members Bank there, {D you know, }   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and } there is a island in the middle --  __label__39
Washington, it really is [ a, + {F uh, } {F uh, } an ] international city, where Baltimore is hometown Baltimore.   __label__39
[ [ What, + what kind of, ] + what kind of ] paint do you normally use?  __label__35
{C But } your humidity is different though than ours I think,   __label__39
{C And } what what kind of books do you read?  __label__35
#  (( [ not, + ] {F uh } )) , # {D you know, } documentaries or real stories about real people and that kind of stuff or dramas in real life.  __label__1
{C and } there are certainly benefits to its doing so,   __label__40
{C And so } they just sort of, {D you know, } adopted me as their eleventh child   __label__39
# Yeah <laughter>. #  __label__11
-- teachers up there [ that, + that ] do dress up more than others.  __label__1
{F Um, } yeah.  __label__14
And not have any care.  __label__2
we, -  __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
It's for the large dealers is what, __label__39
That's interesting.   __label__13
[ I get a so-, + I get a sore ]  neck from looking up all the time,  {D yeah, }   things like that <laughter> --  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__31
# It's like, -  __label__0
# {C And } we're, # - __label__0
<Throat_clearing>. __label__43
You're like -- __label__40
Yeah,   __label__7
Yeah.  __label__11
There's hills in Texas.  __label__39
# they # really are expensive,   __label__40
{F Oh, } they're bulbs for Spring or Fall?  __label__37
One of the nice things,   __label__1
Yep.  __label__11
[ [ We, + we  ] just don't think, + we don't think  ] some of the politicians are really interested in our best interests.  __label__40
{C and } she didn't have, {D you know, }  {D like, } -  __label__39
I have.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Okay.  __label__11
<noise>, you there?  __label__37
Yeah,   __label__31
Right.  __label__11
{C So. } - __label__0
<Laughter>. __label__43
{D like } T I has, __label__39
[ I think, + [ I, + I ] think ] it [ should take, + from conviction to execution should take ] no longer than a year.  __label__40
[ Maybe i-, + {D well, } maybe that ] was, {F um, } - __label__40
{C but } [ I, + I ]  also think there are a lot of areas <breathing> especially in, {F uh, }   [ big government, + federal government, ] {F uh, }  where we're short changed.  {F Uh, } lot of money spent for, {F uh, } things that are not used   __label__40
{C So } by this time my checks had come back from the bank.   __label__39
{C and } you're going to be happy in the end <laughter>.  __label__39
there's  not too many [ that are, +  {F uh, } that are ] good just [ on their, + ] {D you know, } [ that, +  that ]  you wouldn't want to change something,   __label__40
{D Well, } we like Arby's. __label__26
{D Now } we wouldn't have that problem, <laughter>  because we're not vegetarians.  __label__39
<Laughter> . __label__43
Yes,   __label__22
Very protective,  __label__40
It's very easy.  __label__40
{D So, }  it was real nice.  __label__39
it was not applicable to me   __label__39
Well, I talked to a woman who lived up in the hills, uh, __label__39
{D Well, }  you can interpret [ that the, + [ what + ] the  ] T V show, in the same way that you can interpret the Bible.  __label__1
{C and, } {F uh, } if you've ever seen the size of those, {F uh, } motors -- __label__39
Different life styles,   __label__2
Okay.   __label__14
{C and } those [ are, + are ] pleasant.  __label__39
{D Actually, } I like to read also,   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Be n-, - __label__0
me too,   __label__7
I think attitudes are more lax now than they used to be.  __label__40
how does the argument work [ if, + {F uh, } if ] the bad guys are  going to have guns anyway.   __label__35
Yeah,   __label__11
{C but } specifically the woman's role, __label__40
Yeah.   __label__31
{D Well, } do you do a lot of dining out?  __label__37
And it shows the, the unpreparedness for such, such a problem.  __label__40
Yes.  __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries.  __label__39
Right.  __label__11
{C And } with rollers and, {F uh, } modern latex paints,   __label__1
Huh-uh.  __label__11
{C but } it's tuition, full tuition paid if your parent works at T C U.  __label__39
I -- __label__39
{F Oh, } it does.   __label__7
{F Oh, } yeah.   __label__7
{F Um. }  __label__11
-- I know.   __label__11
I think you're right.   __label__7
{F Uh, } <lipsmack>, {D well, } today was warmer <laughter>.   __label__39
{C and } they have all these teams from, -  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
some times,  __label__1
[ [  I, + I ] can't, + I can't ] if it's TWENTY TWENTY <sniffing>  or one of those things where, -  __label__39
{C so. } - __label__22
# Yeah. #  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
yeah,   __label__11
{F Oh, } I'm so sorry.   __label__14
{F Oh. }  {C But, } of course,  it's just what the market will bear.  __label__39
{D So. } I know, my father had  a P C,   __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
for those who love bugs,   __label__1
Cindy, have you seen DANCES WITH WOLVES?  __label__37
{C but } again high school football is just so much fun to watch,   __label__40
[  I've, + I've ] not really had that many problems with it,   __label__39
I was going to tell you the same thing.   __label__39
{D now } tell me your favorite team.  __label__8
{C So } you, - __label__0
{F Uh, } have you, {F uh, } gotten into SCARLETT yet?  __label__37
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C but } that's about as far as he'll go.  __label__39
{C and } she just gave me this woman's name to contact   __label__39
<clicking> <music> {D Well, } Kathleen, do you believe that there is a problem with our public school system?  __label__37
Of course, you have to get there early if you  want to get anything, __label__40
{C and } they don't have big tourism.   __label__39
{C but } I think that was the last time we were really involved,   __label__39
{C But } I might check,  __label__39
# I spent, # __label__39
My father had, {F uh, } -  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
you, -  __label__0
[ It's just, + I just, ] {D you know. } - __label__0
{F Um, } {D well } a lot of people,  they'll vote the way their family votes, {D you know, }  __label__39
you can watch baseball on T V   __label__39
-- {C and } it's really sad.  __label__40
no,   __label__29
yeah,   __label__0
Is it?  __label__37
# {C But, } {F uh, } #  __label__0
there's Celinas which is about a fifteen minute drive, which is mostly migrant workers,   __label__39
Our situation was somewhat different, {F uh, } in view of the fact that, {F uh, } [ we haven't, + ] we were a landmark case,   __label__39
{D Now } [ are you, + are you ] talking about the elected people   __label__37
Yeah,   __label__7
<Throat_clearing>. __label__43
{C And } that is not too far away,   __label__40
There,  {D yeah, } - __label__0
{C And, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] make the trip and did the  whole New Orleans before the game [ and the game + ] and everything __label__39
{C or } did it come out in the, - __label__37
{D Well, } [ I, + the reason why I ] was thinking about looking at it is because it's supposed to, -  __label__40
I think when we moved here it was like a hundred and twenty, something like  that.   __label__40
I watch him.  __label__39
# Right.  #  __label__11
{F Oh, } my gosh.   __label__13
{C and } it's kind of distressing, isn't it?  __label__37
Okay,   __label__18
{C and } that's maybe what you were talking about.   __label__38
-- [ just, +  just ] to get a sense  for, {D you know, } [ how, +  how ] it affected them. __label__1
{D Well, } that's easy.   __label__40
-- {D you know, } lots of shade and squirrels and birds and -- __label__39
they said we don't want to have to decide all these things,  __label__39
We ended up with [ our, + our ] living and  dining room are now, {F uh, } kind of [ a, + a ]  light peach color with, {F uh, } -  __label__39
I turn around and go, what!  __label__39
{C and } it had  strawberries, kiwis, and raspberries -- __label__39
Out oldest son.  When, {F uh, } - __label__39
{E I mean, } they are eighteen to twenty-four, some of the young men and women.   __label__39
{C So, } __label__39
(( There ))  isn't, __label__40
I try to get away from that.   __label__39
{D Well, } they're not c-, - __label__0
<Noise> Exactly.  __label__7
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Sometimes we have really good luck with them,   __label__39
I saw that one.  __label__39
Right.   __label__11
# and # make sure [ it's, + it's ] a friendly animal, __label__1
<Laughter>. __label__43
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{E I mean, } for a long time they didn't do this,  __label__39
((   ))  with baseball tickets,   __label__1
{C but } outside of that, no.   __label__39
As a matter of fact, they even went to the point of printing our Social Security number on your driver's license.  __label__39
point seven five liters and then liters and then one point seven # five liters,   __label__39
so cost, {D you know, } - __label__1
Cheering you on and stuff. #  __label__16
{E I mean, } [ there, + there ] were times when [ he was, + {D like, }  he'd ] be running with a gun or whatever.   __label__39
Oh.  __label__11
They hardly ever play music when a shark attacks somebody.  __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F Um, } it's pretty fun.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I do.   __label__39
it's  kind of tough to think of some of the others. Although, I do watch some of some of those frivolous things.   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{D well } I do not like them   __label__39
{D Well, } we had it for awhile   __label__39
[ We're, + we're ] only about ten minutes from Ogden.  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
A real dog # and # -- __label__1
That's interesting.  __label__39
They're all, yours   __label__40
{D You know? }  __label__37
[ Did you, + did you ] introduce your daughter to her before you made, __label__37
Yeah.  __label__7
It's getting, __label__39
Oh.  __label__18
I like your governor.  __label__39
{C So } dogs that get down in the hips, -  __label__39
I pretty much question [ or + ] [ what, + what ] the U S -s  motives were [ [ in, {F uh, } + in, ] + in ] actually the original involvement.  __label__39
{C and } that's not really beneficial,   __label__39
[ # Taking # , + taking ] one more life [ [ doesn't, + doesn't, ] + doesn't ]  ]  [ re-, + ] # get things back the way they were, right. #  __label__1
{F Oh, } okay.  __label__11
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and } ]  [ I, + I ] kind of think [ it's, + {F uh, } it's ]  a lot of work  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{C and } we wanted air-conditioning and a five speed   __label__39
{C but } it's a big commitment.   __label__40
Eighty eighty-eight is what you said?  __label__19
{F Oh, } okay.  __label__11
In fact, when they offer us extended warranties, [ we, + we ] don't buy them # because [ [ we've, + # __label__39
That's right.  __label__7
{C and } that puts a bondage on them.   __label__40
Uh-huh.   __label__11
Oh.  __label__11
I probably would say  the something if I knew [ that +  [ inte-, +  intellectually ] that ] it was good   __label__40
{D Well, } course there's [ a, + a ] <laughter>  tremendous number of [ refrigerators and  fre-, + {E excuse me, } refrigerators and freezers, ]  both commercial and residential, {F uh, } utilizing freon twelve,   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
{C And } I just, {F uh, } {E I mean } -  __label__0
I guess you, -  __label__40
Twenty-eight.   __label__12
Maybe on [ smaller, + smaller ] scales.  __label__39
She also works --  __label__39
{C and } it goes real good on dandelions.  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
we, -  __label__0
that's, {F uh, } -  __label__0
{F Oh, } dear.  __label__13
the other side presents their case   __label__39
{C and } the only requirement is, of course, your skill of passing these tests,  __label__39
{C but } on the nightly news, {D now, } he goes into his  commentary   __label__39
I knew a lot of guys in the service when they were sent to Germany they said that's the safest place in the world because if a war starts, all the bombs are going to go right over Germany   __label__39
{C and } it's real good.   __label__39
No,   __label__29
it's a locally owned paper.  __label__39
{C and } we had to write code in binary   __label__39
I am recently retired <noise>   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
-- [ yet, +  {D like, }  {D say, } {D you know, } the University of Small Town in Arkansas or  something, __label__40
Yeah.   __label__11
# they are great. #  __label__40
that were able-bodied, __label__1
Have y'all been having any heat waves or {D like } the ninety degree, - __label__37
Even when he's sad, {D you know, } you great faith that he will get happy again.  __label__40
{D Well, } they did a thing on the  thirty-five billion dollars we waste every year just on storing stuff for the military  we don't need.   __label__39
No,   __label__10
they live in Grand Prairie,   __label__39
{C and } [ they're all, + {F uh, } they're all ] thinking that, {F uh, } {D man, } [ [ they, + they, ] + they ] really got something going this year,  __label__39
Yeah.   __label__11
It's been a while since  I've seen it.   __label__39
the safety is, {F uh,} -  __label__0
{C But } still, it came up though, didn't it,  __label__37
Yeah.  __label__12
{C but } it would be a very small one.   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
-- the purpose is not very legal.  __label__1
{C But } cases where I think the death penalty should be withheld, {F uh, } not really that I can think of.  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
[ {C or } + {C and } ] you, by that day -  __label__39
No,   __label__11
{F Uh, } every evening at six thirty, I believe,   __label__39
the  signature, {F uh, } -  __label__0
{C And } I read the whole damn book  while I was home hauling out, {D you know, } {D like } ten-gallon buckets [ of, + of ] water and waiting  for the roof to collapse and, __label__39
True,   __label__13
{C But, } [ I, + {F uh, } I  ] don't know   __label__39
If it's the kind of river I'm thinking of,  better [ them, +  [ than, + than ] ] us,  {D you know } <breathing> <laughter>.   __label__40
{D Well, } a lot of the experience that I have with this problem has to do with my brother-in-law who's Chinese and immigrated from China.   __label__39
this is the first call I've done,  __label__39
-- {C but } it's so tasty, you can't stand it.  __label__39
they tend to come out with a new book every couple of weeks -- __label__39
[ {C And } th-, + {C and } most ] live within ten -- __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__7
the time that I was down there, I stayed quite [ a, + a ] bit at [ the, + {F uh, } {F uh, } one of the ] big hotels  (( San )) Salvador.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and } they were, {D you know, } toward the bottom of the league.   __label__39
the food here is outrageous.   __label__39
{C And } if they kept it up, -  __label__40
[ Who, + who ] was in that.  __label__35
but any time you sell a car or buy a car it has to be inspected in this state.  __label__39
What school are you going to?  __label__35
{C but } -- __label__39
-- {C so } I can't do very much gardening other than balcony gardening -- __label__39
{D Well, } sometimes it depends on which way the winds blowing --  __label__39
He felt that he really had an in   __label__39
Uh-huh.   __label__11
{C and } I think he's actually, honestly trying to do some change.  __label__40
# {D Well, } I want # to see that and CITY SLICKERS both. #   __label__39
{C And so } they went and tried out   __label__39
Anything,   __label__22
Yeah.  __label__11
# recommendations # from your friends or, __label__1
{D well, } I guess it wasn't a real good topic for us,   __label__40
right,   __label__7
[ And, + and ] drive through Woodland Park and go for a short drive in the mountains and have breakfast.  __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Right,   __label__7
[ {C and, } +  {C and, } ] {F uh, } {D you know. } - __label__0
[ there was, + there was ] something wrong with him at the time,   __label__39
{C And } you can look at [ the, + {F uh, } the ]  track record on, __label__39
{C and } he would write C O T.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
do you have <static>. - __label__37
I think that would be interesting.  __label__40
{C and } they throw the different stuff in the different doors.  __label__39
-- {C and, } {F uh, } he told me that there're a [ lot of, + {F uh, } lot of ] counts against the Canadian system, which is basically the one people are talking about for here.  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
I usually get to the point where I can play some of my favorite themes   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__22
{F Uh, } men don't have this choice,  __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C but } [ I guess that's true, +  I guess that's  true. ]   __label__7
{C But } you have to put the water in proportionally.   __label__39
{C But } [ [ it, +  I don't think [ it, +     that ] it's ] <breathing>  developed as much as it could be for the size company as T I.  __label__40
Yeah   __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D Well, } I don't know many rich that don't have enough tax breaks to, -  __label__39
That's true.  __label__7
that.  __label__1
{C and } it kind of rolls in over the coast.    __label__39
Because you'd probably be, {F uh, } too puritanical   __label__16
{C and } everybody in the fourth grade's basically taught the same thing.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
A worm?  __label__37
jeez.  __label__13
They, -  __label__0
Uh-huh,   __label__11
{C and, } {F uh, } that was kind of for them,   __label__39
-- {D you know, }   __label__1
there's a pin in there that you can pull on these G M cars --  __label__39
My two oldest brothers were very interested in skiing.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
First good season, the coach can do no wrong.  __label__40
Yeah,   __label__7
But never anything mixed with Bisquick.  __label__1
some things we can't do, <breathing>   __label__39
<Breathing> {D Well, } maybe this thing  [ with + <breathing>, with ] the child at school, maybe that will <lipsmack> make people think a bit  more {C and, } {D you know, } take some steps [ to, +  to ] correct it.   __label__40
[ that's + __label__0
I would just encourage you to do a little traveling, though, before you get married.   __label__8
# and ] # live happy lives.   __label__1
Hi.   __label__23
# No,   __label__10
#  ((   )) . # - __label__43
# Uh-huh,   __label__11
{C but } it's also the vacation vehicle that we all drive in.   __label__39
{F Oh, } that's amazing.   __label__13
<whispering>, no   __label__29
I think som-, Chico's -  __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
-- {C and } I like a lot of classical music,   __label__39
it's the, -  __label__0
{C and } I will admit I'm reasonably skeptical also.   __label__39
-- that I would never order from -- __label__1
I went and bought the video.   __label__39
They remodeled the entire back yard.    __label__39
bagels and lox.  __label__39
Yes.  __label__11
I've never seen taxes really go down.  __label__39
Yeah <laughter>.  __label__11
They hadn't, -  __label__0
It's amazing.  __label__39
{C and } that just raises your taxes, {D you know, } they just get it a different way --  __label__40
uh-huh.  __label__11
{F Oh, } super.  __label__13
<Laughter>. __label__43
{F Uh, } [ it's just, + {F uh, } it's just ] [ the, + the ] same, -  __label__39
{F Oh. }  __label__11
Yeah.  __label__0
{F Uh } -- __label__39
yet there's so many material things to be had out there that a lot of people think,  {F oh, } {C but, } if we both work, we can get a really big house, __label__39
Yeah.   __label__11
Okay.   __label__18
they just keep raising them.  __label__39
# Uh-huh # <<very faint>>.  __label__11
{F Oh, } that's always refreshing to get away from.  __label__13
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and } that was pre-AIDS and all the other, {F um, } things, __label__39
I have one of those.   __label__39
{C and } I thought, I don't understand this, {D you know. }  __label__39
{D like }  up here, last year, the governor was up for re-election   __label__39
{C but } it's been cloudy, overcast and threatening rain all day.  __label__39
I do not know <laughter>.  __label__25
What do you think about it?    __label__33
<Laughter>. __label__43
-- fresh seafood down there,  __label__2
-- while I'm working, [ I don't get a, + I don't get a ]  chance to read the paper a lot,   __label__1
{F Oh, } # yeah. #  __label__11
[ {C but, } +  {F uh, } {C and } ] a lot of people have gone in the military, {E I mean, } {D you know, }  when they're in the college.   __label__40
-- {C and } [ they + <talking> <<women's voices>> they ] check that name against, {F uh, } their list   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
# if I wanted # to, {D you know, } [ d-, + ]  in fact, I still have offers, {D you know, } please come back,  __label__1
{F Huh. }  __label__0
#  ((   )) . # __label__0
I was looking at a Honda Accord, a brand new one --  __label__39
It really is.  __label__13
Yeah,   __label__11
{C but } I never thought a clutch was disposable. __label__39
{C and then } they reinstated it later,   __label__39
# Yeah.  #  __label__11
<Laughter>. __label__43
{C But, } assume that they do a reasonable job in other areas. __label__1
{D well, } bye.  __label__22
I'm not,   __label__39
# Uh-huh. #  __label__11
Why not go to adults, too?  __label__32
{D so, } - __label__0
{C so } -- __label__39
{C but } you don't have to do that option if you don't want to.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Okay.   __label__14
Right.  __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
Was it hard when you first came?  __label__37
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } <music> {C and then, } ] {F uh, } I hurt my neck, {F uh, } about three years ago.  __label__39
{C but } then when you decided what ice was <laughter>. - __label__40
-- last weekend.  __label__1
Oh.  __label__11
{C and } the other just has, __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
they have, {F uh, } wonderful features,   __label__40
[  It, + it's, ] -  __label__0
I know what you mean.  __label__13
{C but } it's quite, {F uh. } -  __label__0
{C but, } - __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__31
-- {F uh, } how can you do anything about a problem besides if you don't know about it?  __label__32
what had gone on.   __label__1
It was fun.  __label__39
# Uh-huh. #  __label__11
it's nice at night.  __label__40
-- {D you know, } and get things [ on a, + on an ] even, -  __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
-- the scallops.   __label__1
{E I mean, }  it wasn't a very, {F um, } strong stroke.   __label__39
{D Well, } that's, -  __label__0
I see.    __label__11
That's the last one I saw, I think.  __label__39
[ {C but, } + {C but } ] other than that I think [ it's, + it's ] a good idea to get them involved in city and community activities and, {D you know, } {D like } the, {F uh, } shelters and,  {F uh, } <breathing> <lipsmack>, that kind of, thing, __label__40
{C and } we ended up with them, right.   __label__39
{D Well } I thought it would be a good idea if maybe you  took some of the kids and had them go over to other countries   __label__40
Good talking to you too, Don.  __label__22
yeah.  __label__11
Mine, too <laughter>.   __label__7
Yeah.  __label__11
{F Uh, } I'm a research engineer,   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{C And } [ you + <throat_clearing>, {E excuse me. } __label__39
{F Oh, } it's a wonderful place to live,   __label__26
[ that, +  that ] is a problem with  the distance.    __label__40
Right,   __label__26
He just get one more  ((   )) .  __label__0
Yeah.  __label__11
<<faint>> uh-huh.  __label__11
oh, yeah.  __label__7
# They # always ask me to, bring those rolls <<louder>>.  __label__1
It's something I can do with her, plus, {F um, } doesn't tax me too physically.  __label__39
Okay,   __label__22
{D Well, } I guess too if  I thought that this would help really and truly do away with the drug problem, then that would be one thing. __label__40
{C but } is it a legal, {F uh, } solution for some companies.   __label__39
# {E I mean } I didn't # work,   __label__39
[ I think that the, + I think what, ] -  __label__40
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] they're very dissatisfied,   __label__40
{F Oh, } I see.  __label__18
<Throat_clearing>. __label__43
{C But } even now, {D you know, } they don't even do that.  __label__40
{D You know, } they teach their children,  {F uh, } in such a way that, - __label__40
which I support of course,   __label__1
I, {D well, } -  __label__0
Isn't that true.   __label__17
We've tried it, __label__39
{F Oh, } you haven't?  __label__17
they rate, -  __label__0
Yeah,   __label__7
{E I mean } to you -  __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
you know, it, -  __label__0
you too.  __label__22
{F Huh. }  __label__0
That's what I mean,   __label__39
{D well, } maybe they didn't mention it because it's just kind of a fact of life around here.   __label__40
Yeah   __label__31
{D Well } I'll tell you.   __label__4
That's why I'm surprised I like those two shows, because usually I like, {D you know, } stuff that just ends sort of, that [ you just, + you ] don't have to, __label__39
we love the Cowbo-, - __label__39
{C and } [ I, + I  ] worked in the same lab with a guy   __label__39
it's really good,   __label__39
[ I'm, + I'm ] a believer in the old adage that if somebody earns something it's worth more to them than if you give it to them,   __label__40
[ {C but, } + __label__40
[ {C and, } +  {C and } ] it's not that much of a strain,   __label__39
Your right,   __label__7
I don't know.  __label__30
Okay.  __label__11
Nice talking to you.  __label__22
so that, {D you know, } -  __label__1
They sit   __label__39
Yeah   __label__11
Yep.  __label__31
I feel like the middle class people are supporting the nation   and, {F uh, } that the rich are not paying their share   __label__40
{C but, }  of course it's hard when you don't have any family around.  __label__40
-- going to be under scrutiny, it's going to be the teachers.  __label__1
{F Oh } really,   __label__11
One of the things that upset me when I lived in California was, {F uh, } they did a lot of things with [ s-, + your Social ] Security number.  __label__39
Of course, then we wouldn't have any room to put people,   __label__40
This plea bargaining baloney, __label__40
he was a D A  __label__39
it's to their advantage to play to as big an audience <laughter>, __label__40
Sure.  __label__11
It's really a shame.  __label__40
One rotten cat <laughter>.  __label__12
Oh.  __label__18
Yeah.   __label__11
{F Um. } __label__25
{C And } it's [ [ n-, + o-, ] + one ] of the things that it's used for, primarily, is for demographic, {F uh, } research.   __label__39
Right.  __label__11
-- {C and } the Saudis are our allies.   __label__39
{D Well. }  Bless your enemies, if your enemy is hungry, feed him,   __label__5
-- {D you know, } [ it was, + it was ]  the best defense they could come up with.  __label__1
it's really weird issue.   __label__40
{F Oh } <baby_talking>.  __label__18
{C So, } really, it was always just money -- __label__39
All right.  __label__11
{C But, } {F uh, } anyway, that was a French movie --  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{C and, } {F uh, } basically, {F uh, } I found a recipe to make it in the microwave   __label__39
# Right.  #  __label__11
Probably the Boston Celtics.   __label__39
Right.  __label__11
Really.   __label__11
let me turn the T V off,   __label__4
{F Um, } {D well, } [ I like to have, +  {F um, } sometimes when I have a dinner party I'll have, ]   {F um, } everybody bring something,  __label__39
That's right .  __label__7
{C and } it's sort of by category.   __label__39
# Right. #  __label__11
# Home # school.  __label__39
# {D you # know, } [ at, + ] even though [ it was, + it was ]  really summer down here.   __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I know,   __label__7
{C and } if not, {D you know, } [ don't, + don't ] let them sit up there on death row for, {D you know, } <laughter> fifteen years.  __label__40
{D Now, } aluminum I don't know.   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
[ I have, +  I have ] a couple friends too that have about three of them maxed out <laughter>.   __label__39
{C but } it's pretty hard to think that, {D you know, } people are just going to shoot each other down   __label__40
well. - __label__0
Her dad has a cabin,   __label__39
Uh-huh,   __label__7
<Laughter>. __label__43
yeah.  __label__7
I don't subscribe to either,   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{E I mean, } it's, {F uh, } - __label__0
{C And so } he brought me up from like a hundred and fifteen, I had my high game of two eighty-seven.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
# Late thirties,   __label__39
they must ] have changed then.  Because it used, {D well } -  __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D Now } {D see, } I went to E T   __label__39
{C so } that the silver will be predominate in the kittens.  __label__39
-- [ # if you're, # + {D you know, } if you're  ] two miles away from water <laughter>.  __label__1
I was on the jury.  {F Uh, }  __label__39
{C but } it sure seems nice to me.  __label__40
Are you going to move your whole family over there then?  __label__37
{C and, } - __label__0
-- {C but } I just have a problem paying twenty five dollars for a movie that I can go down and rent for a dollar <laughter>.  __label__40
{F Uh, } yes.   __label__31
# {F Oh, } great.  #  __label__13
to commute to work?  __label__37
{C and } it's not really as hot and muggy as it would be being over a hundred plus [ ninety degree humidity, + __label__39
it sure was.  __label__7
Okay,   __label__18
I feel much the same way.   __label__40
{C and then } you have to really sit down and plan some more   __label__40
{C and } it has not today,   __label__39
{C but, } [ I, +  I, ] -  __label__0
{C So } they don't have that.   __label__39
You bet.  __label__7
they're still in elementary.  __label__39
Not a lot of gravy -- __label__2
{C and } a couple of them it was, what we did in some of the other cities   __label__39
# To be violent. #  __label__40
{C so. } - __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
uh-huh,   __label__11
If you can afford them.   __label__40
{F Oh } my gosh.  __label__13
charge cards, __label__1
{C but } to me, he belongs up [ [ in the field, + {D you know, } in the -- __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D you know, } I guess a lot of the large organizations, <noise> probably T I, did they advertise on television how successful they are?  __label__37
{D well } do you even know what the  procedures are now?  __label__37
# It's not really like # -- __label__40
# Yeah.  #  __label__11
I don't know [ how, +  what ]  it would take to [ be, +  come up ] with a true perfect system, {E or } if one exists.   __label__39
{C so } I can get a deal [ [ from the, + {F uh, } from the ma-, ] + from the ] supplier,  __label__39
I haven't learned to hit the ball easy   __label__39
You know what am I trying to say?  __label__37
right.  __label__11
At least in capital cases I'd think they'd have to be -- __label__40
{C And } I think most women walk in [ [ and, + and, ] + and ] with, {F Oh, } got to clean all this up.  Got to get this out and this in and this, {D you know, } taken care of, instead of having someone say -- __label__40
[ Th-, + does ] he invest in that # and # -- __label__37
-- {C and } I'm not really sure how I feel about that.  __label__25
{E I mean, } she has everything planned so closely, __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
right.   __label__11
the times we've seen it, it's been {D like } on [ Satur-, + {E or, excuse me, } Friday ] night.   __label__39
That's sure ri-,   __label__0
I live near a Walmart   __label__39
Uh-huh.   __label__11
{D Well, } {F uh, } just briefly.   __label__39
I've seen that in the dealership.    __label__39
Yeah.   __label__11
somewhere down  the line  they went standardized,   __label__39
{C But } when they initially come over, - __label__39
you too,   __label__22
[ I, + my friend ] [ is, + is ] very generous [ in, + in ] letting us have my children, {F uh, } do the Suzuki method -- __label__39
{C because, } {E I mean, } Purdue, even though they're one of the few schools that really, {F uh, } stress academics, they're suffering, {D you know }   __label__39
{C and } [ they just do-, + they don't ] care as much.  __label__40
[ it was just, + {D you know, } it was just ] [ plain, + a plain, ] {F uh, } [ ro-, +  {D you know, } round, ] {F uh, } necked, {F uh, } [ sw-, + sweater. ]  __label__39
# {C So } it # -- __label__40
-- and that there would be some opportunity for friendships that way, so  that you would feel happy going to work every day  [ and + ] -- __label__1
{C So } is it, {F uh, } -  __label__0
[ {C and, } +  {C and, } ] {F uh, } upgraded it and put things in there and dibbled and  dabbled   __label__39
{C And, }  {F uh, } I got to stay home with my kids, which I really wanted to do,   __label__39
{C and } [  they, + they ] get off for good behavior   __label__40
-- unless you don't want them to do it.  __label__1
#Oh, boy <laughter>.#  __label__13
it might be, {F um, } no taxes on our things, our computers going into their nation,   __label__40
-- it was just ] big enough for a couple of people to sack out.  __label__1
# Right. #  __label__11
{C So } that was important to me, and also insurance for [ the fa-, + our family  ] -- __label__39
having a daughter who has gone [ into this, +  into engineering, ] __label__39
{C And } interestingly enough the canal is quite small and, and realistically could be sabotaged [ quite, + quite ] easily.   __label__40
It was good.  __label__39
Actually, - __label__0
Do you think, __label__37
Your family doesn't live close, then?  __label__38
{D Well, } yeah,   __label__31
[ [ that, + that  is almost, ] +  {E I mean } that's absolutely ] unprecedented   __label__39
save a little bit on that sales tax,  because on a car that really [ mo-, + ]  kind of mounts up <talking>.  __label__1
Yeah,   __label__11
{C and } [ I, + I ] know that any statement in absoluteness is not necessarily true, {F uh, }   __label__40
{D Well, } __label__39
{C but } <inhaling> not being in [ the + {D say } the ] commercial sector, the motivation isn't there for a lot of people -- __label__40
That's a very [ ver-, + very, ] very competitive business.  __label__39
No, {F um, }   __label__29
# {D Well, } # my stepson, {D you know, } [ I, + ]   he went into the Navy or Air Force.   __label__39
<Breathing> {D Well, } that's about five minutes,   __label__39
I, -  __label__0
Uh-huh,   __label__11
No.  __label__7
{F Uh. } {C But } since it was a civil case it really didn't matter, {D right? }   __label__37
# That # -- __label__39
{C And } [ it's, +  are you ] cooking the whole head -- __label__37
I know some of my friends who have pets, {F uh, }   __label__39
# I think that, # - __label__0
{C and, } {F uh, } <lipsmack> she had a baby.   __label__39
{F Oh } my gosh.  __label__13
pretty much the same. -  __label__39
-- {C or, } - __label__0
This is true,   __label__7
would vote pro choice.  __label__1
right.  __label__7
I just don't understand why they're not right up there on the top -- __label__39
{D You know, } you really can probably count thousands of stars,  __label__39
{C And } my wife said, {D well, } do I need that?   __label__39
I thought that was most interesting.  __label__40
{C But } there are various other areas such [ as, + as ] farm subsidies that ought to be slashed.   __label__40
Oh.  __label__11
{C But } if you pay out less,  then you lose that money.  __label__39
{D Well } I think that currently the way the law stands isn't so much that the laws are enforceable or not,   __label__40
That's right.  __label__7
would be -  __label__1
That's right.  __label__7
Yeah.  __label__11
No,   __label__29
{C So } [ h-, +  he ] hasn't really gotten  into, {F um, } that yet.   __label__39
-- {C and } you're seeing them, {F uh, } get, {F uh, } elected to, {F uh, } <static> political offices. __label__40
as far as brokers all,   I get calls from brokers in New York,   __label__39
-- [ [ {C and, } +  {D you know, } {C and, } ] +  {C and } ] she feel madly in love with this writer.  __label__39
{C And } they had talked about having a thing like, one Saturday a month, you could come and  drop your aluminum cans off from home, {D you know, }  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C but } I think it probably was [ the, + the ] train.  __label__39
{F Um. }  __label__0
there's so, -  __label__0
I'm kind of interested because  [ I'm + {D actually, } that's the route I'd ] like to take  when I finally get my degree -- __label__39
Right,   __label__7
{C But } it's not like it's burned,   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
yeah,   __label__0
that, - __label__1
{C But } gee it was good # talking with you. #  __label__22
uh-huh,   __label__7
That's right,   __label__26
even to watch it.  __label__1
{E I mean } if you leave something anywhere # you might as well forget it. #  __label__40
Okay.  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__11
You're going to lock me up one day, aren't you.  __label__5
-- {C and } the other part of her family was up in, {F uh, } New York state.  __label__39
there was a movie about a professional golfer   __label__39
yet [ I -- + __label__39
{C So, } how does she feel about  going out and doing stuff with you all.  __label__35
{C so } I know it sounds like a rationalization   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__7
What was wrong with her, was  she not attractive  enough, did she not take good enough care of her man to  keep his interest.   __label__32
<<Very faint>> Uh-huh.  __label__11
I think you're right,   __label__7
{C but } it's still been bad --  __label__40
{C and, }  {F uh, } first of all, [ th-, + they, ] -  __label__0
okay.  __label__18
We always  check and see if we should answer the door, __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
-- them to a degree.  __label__1
# Yeah. #  __label__11
No,   __label__7
-- {C and, } {D you know, } [ I, + that's ]  a very true statement   __label__40
{F Oh, } I know.  __label__7
Yeah,   __label__31
I wish we were given an opportunity to vote on more things.  __label__39
I love that.    __label__39
[ E-, + even  ] in some families some people talk a little bit different.  __label__40
Yeah.  __label__11
They'll, {F um, } -  __label__39
they just [ put it on a charge card, +  put it on account, ] __label__40
Right.  __label__11
{C and } she got her job back, {C and } -- __label__39
{C and } the last time was in October   __label__39
{F Oh, } really. __label__13
Yeah.  __label__11
me too.  __label__39
{C and } either  the military or  public service organization can give them a lot of focus.   __label__40
{C and then, } now we're in  [ U-, + Iowa  ] <laughter>.  __label__39
did you cut them down [ at the, + at the ]  ground level,   __label__37
{F Uh, } just ten months.  __label__39
-- and a sun roof,  [ and, + ] {F uh, } just so it'd be a good solid car.   __label__1
-- {D you know, } when they had [ that, + the ] Elvis Presley music # and stuff like that. # __label__1
It takes a lot more planning.  __label__40
-- {C and then } I forget to take that <laughter> out of my  checking account.  __label__39
{D Well, } {F uh, } okay.   __label__11
Yeah.  __label__31
# {F Oh, } you're kidding. #  __label__13
{C So, } - __label__0
[ I don't, +  I really don't ] want to share a boat with a snake.  __label__39
# No. #  __label__29
{C But, } {D you know, } by then she had practically got her degree,   __label__39
that was the other guy from C B S,   __label__39
# {C And, } {F uh, } # - __label__0
<breathing> say, for example, in Pensacola, Florida, on that house <breathing> with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on, might pay three or four hundred dollars a year taxes. __label__39
no.  __label__7
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F Oh, } of course not.  __label__7
Okay.   __label__14
meet friends    __label__1
{F Uh, } I don't know about that,   __label__30
{C But, }  this wasn't a good subject,   __label__40
{F Oh, } how pretty.  __label__13
# may be parents ] ] # themselves or something.  __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C And } we may have to do it out of necessity as far as moving that time schedule up.   __label__40
{C so } they have this think tank.   __label__39
I know, it's too bad that they've gotten so expensive.  __label__40
that's right.  __label__7
{F Oh, } that was great.  __label__13
however, {F uh, } every time an organization such as the P L O says {D well } we'll see if we can work with Israel, then, {F uh, } they get embarrassed [ some, + ] every few months by documents that reveal that their ultimate purpose is to totally eliminate them.  __label__40
I ought to go looking through some of my old mail.  __label__39
my husband also, we're involved in everything our kids does --  __label__39
-- debt in the trillions of dollars, {D you know. }  __label__1
-- than [ cut, + {D yeah, } just cut ] everybody back ten percent. __label__1
[ {C but } + {C so, } ] __label__40
{D well, } my favorite, probably, all time T V show is STAR TREK.   __label__39
{D Well, } [ this has, + this station has ]  a lot of just ongoing news --  __label__39
{C and } it seems to be getting tougher as time goes by.  __label__40
{D Well, } do you exercise regularly?  __label__37
{C but } <laughter>, - __label__0
this is not going to happen even though this lady has not really, {D you know, } -  __label__5
It seems like it started to take a turn and then it went away   __label__40
I just see him as trying to squish  [ as much space, + {D you know, } as much house into the space ] as possible.  __label__39
it look like a lobster?  __label__1
That's right.   __label__7
It almost should be the first twelve people that they, {D you know, } have on a list <laughter> are the ones that are on the jury   __label__40
{D well, } that, {F uh, } -  __label__0
God, that's cheap.  __label__13
{F um, } that's what I want.   __label__40
{D You know, } all the kids had cars,  __label__39
No,   __label__29
in my car, and let someone else check the oil even.  __label__1
Yeah,   __label__11
How many have  you had so far, do you know?  __label__35
{D Now } they had -- - __label__0
{C And  then } even like, {F uh, } what is it, Eric Dickerson left, __label__39
{F Oh } you have a spring,  __label__38
Sitting on about a two acre lot now,   __label__1
totally.  __label__7
#  (( BON ))   __label__0
# That's # sad.  __label__14
-- anybody in general street smarts.  __label__1
{C and } they have one of [ the clerks up there, + {E no, } the bag boys out there, ]  {F um, } that will take the [ papers, + newspaper ] out of your car,   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
# <Laughter> # {D Well, } you're not a thirteen year old.   __label__40
-- they offer insurance to everyone,   __label__39
Uh-huh.   __label__7
{C so, } - __label__0
Yeah.  __label__11
{D Now, } {D see } that's recycling, {D you know, }   __label__39
certain medicines [ were, +  were ] legal now   __label__39
boy,  current events is not a good subject for me.  __label__39
-- any of those either,   __label__1
and plus the time on them.   __label__39
-- which I think [ is a, + is an ] invasion of privacy.  __label__1
Uh-huh.   __label__7
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Oh really?  __label__17
{D You know, } I guess [ the whole, + the whole ] environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the # (( )) people. #  __label__40
-- {D you know, } you watch some of the cartoons,   __label__40
We absolutely need that oil.   __label__40
[ I think, + I think ] that that's true,   __label__7
{F Oh, } that's terrible.  __label__13
[ we, +  we, ] my sister uses probably a fertilizer.   __label__39
-- is what they do.  __label__1
Yeah,   __label__11
-- safety, and then mileage.   __label__1
Uh-huh,   __label__11
every four years on one side of my family they plan on having, {F uh, } {D like } my [ p-, + grandparents ] and all their brothers and sisters and then all their kids and grandkids.  __label__39
{C And } [ they just, + # I just, ] # __label__39
Yeah,   __label__31
All right.  __label__11
<laughter> {C and } I'm telling you, [ you just, +  I just ] can't lift the things.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C but } you happen to look the other way during the time,  __label__39
{C and, } - __label__0
{C and } [ he, + he ] is again, national and talks about a lot of financial things.   __label__39
they're about, {F uh, } {F uh, }  thirteen to fourteen thousand dollars and, {D you know, } a bit more if you add some some options #   and so on   __label__39
Of course, I don't,  {D you know, } -  __label__25
{F Oh, } uh-huh.  __label__11
It was, -  __label__0
{C but } one of our funnest games we like to play together is hide and seek,   __label__39
{C Or } do you just put it all in.  __label__34
{C And so } that was two weeks I had missed,   __label__39
It can be   __label__7
((   ))  I'm from Kentucky originally,   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
I stir fried some the other night though.   __label__39
Right.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I'm in San Antonio.  __label__39
I ] don't feel like I, -  __label__1
{D Well, } that's no longer, __label__39
It's, {F uh, } __label__39
{C because, } {F um, } having been in school, we kind of put things off -- __label__39
Really?   __label__17
{C and } there still wasn't enough minority vote [ to get, + to pass ] the plan that they were backing.   __label__39
Really?   __label__17
-- # another #  one in line.   __label__1
<<ends conversation with husband>>. He was trying to think of what the name of it was,  __label__39
right,   __label__7
[ {C and, } + {C and } ]  maybe this is too general,   __label__25
[ You, + you ] call that number   __label__8
Yeah.  __label__11
Hi Diana.  __label__23
# where # I didn't eat any animal products at all.  __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
He just got [ a, + a ] new trial because, __label__39
{F Oh, } absolutely --  __label__7
I guess those are the only places I've skied up there.  __label__39
{C But, } that's what I was <laughter>, # - __label__39
You pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into [ your, + your ] -- __label__39
# Yeah. #  __label__11
-- and had to be out there and watch and that type of stuff.   __label__1
I think so.  __label__22
Okay,   __label__14
It is   __label__7
{C so } <laughter>. - __label__0
# Yeah. #  __label__11
I think  Dallas is pretty scattered.  __label__39
Man.  __label__13
{C Or } we may be having to drive to Plano,   __label__39
you don't know your neighbors, and stuff like that.  __label__40
{C because } [ you support, +  {F uh, } you support ] your government.  __label__40
{D Well, } I formulated a pretty radical  theory over the last ten years, I guess.   __label__39
Okay.  __label__7
Right.   __label__11
all the exhaust.  {F Uh, }   __label__0
right,   __label__41
Right.  __label__11
However, {F uh, } I think we could have executed the war {C and } gotten it over a whole lot quicker.  {F Uh, }   __label__40
Right.   __label__7
Yeah,   __label__7
{C But } if we do, then I'm going to need to find somebody,   __label__39
{C But } I think it's an issue that, {D you know, } -  __label__40
I know there's been a couple of people that we voted for and worked for   __label__39
{C And, } - __label__0
# [ from, # + {F uh, } with ] his Master's Degree in social work   __label__1
V P I.  __label__39
[ so, + so ] many taxes will be deducted from it   __label__40
Yeah,   __label__7
{F Oh, } okay.  __label__11
it __label__1
Yeah,   __label__31
# {C Because, } # {D you know, } you, -  __label__0
# {F Oh, } you're # just live down there?  __label__19
{C But, } {F um, } I guess it's because I'm older,   __label__40
[ I, + I ] have seemed to slide away from that and  rely more on the local paper   __label__39
<Laughter> Yeah,   __label__11
{C and } every time I needed  [ [ it, + it, ] + it, ]  it's,  {F uh, }  {D you know, } __label__39
# {D Well } you're # not, - __label__0
{D Anyway, } I, {F uh, } met my son's, {F uh, } college roommate, is a vet   __label__39
{C so } they're, the last, -  __label__0
Yeah,   __label__7
Right,   __label__11
You, too.  __label__1
# Do I reall-, <TV> <children>. # - __label__0
Unfortunately, [ [ what, + what, ] + ] [ they, + they ] had no idea what they were voting on <laughter> it turns out.  __label__40
{C and } [ they, + {F uh, } they ] broke in [ one, +  one ]  night and found a bunch of memos that were, {F uh, } supposedly [ from, +  from ] Hughes [ to, +   {F uh, } to ] his [ main, +  {F uh, } main ]  [ a-, +  assistant ] back, {F uh, } in the fifties and [ si-, +  {F well, } I guess, in the sixties, ] __label__39
[ It's, + it's ] a hard decision,   __label__40
All righty,   __label__22
[ I, +  I ] would think,   __label__40
<Laughter>. __label__43
-- {D you know. }   __label__1
it destroyed two families -- __label__39
{C and} of course those are two different issues as far as privacy goes --  __label__40
suppose they get Saddam Hussein, which they eventually will,   __label__32
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I, -  __label__0
{C And } I guess that's diversion.   __label__39
she -- __label__39
I have a dog and cat now.  __label__39
{C but } [ it, + it  ] takes about an hour with the two of us working -- __label__39
{C But, } {D you know, } critically acclaimed.   __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F Uh, } pension, I guess, is next.   __label__40
On the whole, I'm pleased when I have an opportunity to hear just the facts.   __label__39
[ it's, + music is ] kind of going an odd direction nowadays, I think.   __label__40
Yeah.  __label__11
# {D Well, } that's one thing they've got.   __label__7
the other one just seems so terrible.  __label__40
-- than twelve people could.  __label__1
stuff like that   __label__1
I've heard that, __label__39
{C and then } mom gets to take care of it, or something.   __label__39
{C and } I'd say, -  __label__39
{C and } my insurance is only going to  cover {D like } fifty of it.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
# [ that, + # that ] are really more of an education  that,   __label__1
<Baby_talking>. __label__43
{C because, } {F uh, } now I almost  never watch a T V program when it's on.  __label__39
No,   __label__7
I can't remember exactly what it was.   __label__39
{C but, } {D you know, } why did he do this,  __label__5
{D Well, } I guess I can just say [ I, + ] it bothers me that I hear a lot [ about, + ] {F um, } {D you know, } on the news that, -  __label__40
{C and } he didn't want to listen to it.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D So } how about you, Charles?  __label__33
{C so, } - __label__0
{F Uh, } I think they just send Christmas letters on it.  __label__28
No,   __label__29
-- when you exercise.  __label__1
It's like we went into winter --  __label__39
{C So } hers was the first one I [ got, + gotten ]   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C So } -- __label__39
{D So } what do you think about it?   __label__33
-- [ I, +  I ] can't say he's real crazy  about elevator music, as he calls it.  __label__39
-- {C and } [ it's really, + it's really ] not  necessary, {F uh, } [ until, + until ] the, disease reaches its final stage, {D you know, }  becomes really infectious --  __label__40
What do you look for in a restaurant?  __label__35
{C And, }  {F uh, } what else are you planning to do, if anything?  __label__35
I understand that.   __label__13
{E I mean, } {C but } again it's a set amount every month. __label__39
{E I mean, } [ I think, + I think ] the only I've ever seen a sequel was TWO THOUSAND AND ONE.  __label__39
{D well, } you see that with the foreigners that come here.  __label__40
I've just today ordered a fax modem   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
# {E I mean } that, {D you know. } # - __label__0
{C but } it's just this big  beautiful Italian restaurant.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D Well, } <laughter>. - __label__11
I grew up next door to, {F uh, }  the Richardson Symphony Orchestra leader   __label__39
((   ))  personally I don't see as Gorbachev as being maybe a threat,   __label__40
{C So } she has got to hire this crew, __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh,   __label__11
{C and } it's not worth it <laughter>.  __label__40
I guess the car too.  __label__39
Not just exercise, but, __label__40
{C so, } {F uh } -- - __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C And } I grew up in a real [ not, + I think not ] normal setting.  __label__39
I says, you go pay to have someone do it.  __label__39
this is probably unusual topic to give two of us in the same city.  __label__40
{C and } I think, I guess, what I feel is that most people, {F um, } they don't like to pay taxes because they feel like there's some people that aren't paying their fair share.  __label__40
{C and } {F uh, } I guess the most significant probably is that so many are working now, __label__40
[ I live in a <breathing>, +  I live in a ] very nice  suburb   __label__39
By the time I put my kids in bed at night,  I don't want to do anything.  __label__39
I mean you get a thousand dollars worth of tools.  __label__16
{C and } I haven't tried another one.  __label__39
{C and } [ it's, + __label__39
Sure.  __label__7
yeah.   __label__7
To report it, -  __label__16
They built lodges before too, like at Caddo Lake. __label__39
{C but } I don't like it real hot -- __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__31
Uh-huh.  __label__11
[ What, + what ] is that?  __label__35
they try to stay in office.   __label__40
Kevin Costner I understand is  supposed to be play Schwartzkopf, supposedly.  __label__39
{C So } [ we're, + we're ]  trying to promote that, because she thought we just put them in a special trash can and threw them away,   __label__39
{F uh, } Central America has always been one of those places where people are more passive, {D you know, } __label__1
Huh.  __label__11
In Panama they've been used to Americans down there for so darn long   __label__39
It's probably a judgment of how bad the recession is.  __label__40
{C And then } [ we, + {D you know, } we ] investigated this by flying some people out from Dallas to observe some of the schools in California that already had it.  __label__39
{F Uh, } I don't know,   __label__25
yeah,   __label__31
# Uh-huh.  #  __label__11
{C and } if it's going over water or something one of them have to take the shot for me because I'm, -  __label__39
# {C and } # they say that they can tie up your answering machine and just have a big long, if they catch your answering machine,  __label__39
{C but } I haven't really had a chance to talk to her about that for a while.  __label__39
{C or } s-, - __label__0
{C So } I think that's [ where + {D you know, } <talking>, kind of where ] he's stuck.   __label__40
-- yes.  __label__7
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] we go to, {D you know, }  {D like } an older part of town  __label__39
-- {F uh, } {D you know, } [ in, + in ] my job.   __label__1
I mean one should be sufficient.  __label__40
# Yes.  #  __label__11
However, certain {F uh, } very liberal minded groups  who do not, {F um, } subscribe to the same ethical system that you and I do, __label__40
One that kind of comes up when you've lost [ it, +  the [ others, + <laughter> other ] subjects.  ]   __label__1
<Laughter>  [ Not, +  not ] a real in depth topic, but -- __label__40
It does make you feel better.   __label__40
Okay --  __label__11
I haven't seen it either.  __label__39
of course [ th-, +  it ]  is a constitutional right that the press must have here, is [ th-, +  the ]  interviewing of jurors after the trial.   __label__39
I used to live in Wylie --  __label__39
-- to mow about half of it <throat_clearing>.  __label__1
{F Oh } my. -  __label__13
{C but } I don't know that you can necessarily put [ a, + <throat_clearing> a ] value on somebody's limb, __label__40
Right,   __label__26
<Laughter>. __label__43
Right.  __label__11
yeah,   __label__7
That's, -  __label__0
give me # my paycheck, so I can go home.  __label__5
it's a concert band,   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I know England is not metric.  __label__39
Which was different <laughter>.  __label__1
# {F Oh, } wow. # <Laughter>.  __label__13
{C and } the Blacks resent them coming in and taking their money,   __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
my husband's family lives  just off of Academy Boulevard at Maize land.  __label__39
is it Chicago and, - __label__37
Yeah,   __label__11
Yeah,   __label__31
-- {C and } I have a daughter in Texas and one in New Mexico,   __label__39
Must have been Thursday, {F uh, }   __label__39
I would absolutely love a sail boat.  __label__39
those are over a million.  __label__40
it's, {F uh, } - __label__0
-- and my son lives here,   __label__1
Yeah.  __label__11
{D Well, } they have lunch specials that -  __label__0
That's funny,   __label__40
{C So. } - __label__0
{C and } [ they e-, + they explain ] to you, {D you know, } what their day consists of and what their general rules are,   __label__40
[ you probably could, + you probably could, ]  __label__22
I want some real good classical music.  __label__1
{C but } [ that, + that ] kind of takes away  from public service.  __label__40
I think people do.   __label__39
That's what happened to this guy.   __label__39
Do you have a separate fuse for your high beam -- __label__37
I don't consider myself a good one,   __label__39
What other shows do you like?  __label__35
{C and } they continue to grow.   __label__39
That's really neat.  __label__13
{D You know, } what for him to finish me off <laughter>. - __label__39
It sounds like that it would probably, - __label__40
# I work # in Massachusetts actually.  __label__39
{D Well, } in some ways, I guess, [  it, + it ] doesn't become really cost saving until you have an industry around it, {D you know. }  Because, __label__40
{C And } you know that's why, # - __label__40
No.  __label__7
Our summers are extremely, {F uh, } hazardous --  __label__39
# <Laughter>. # __label__43
{C and } this all took place in the South.  __label__39
Take, __label__22
uh-huh.  __label__11
I said my goodness, what is it, lined in gold, {D you know, } {F uh. }  __label__39
{F Um, } more people, -  __label__0
and, uh, I was wondering what the weather was,   __label__39
-- going fishing, {F uh } --  __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and, }  {F uh, } turns out it was a prescription.  Or people getting somebody else's blood test.  __label__39
Absolutely.  __label__7
Do you go {D like } home cooking, like Black-Eyed Pea and that kind of thing or -- __label__37
Those flowers, remember those little ones you gave me?  __label__37
I think Chrysler would probably make a good vehicle,   __label__40
I guess [ it, + it ] really isn't for everybody.   __label__40
I guess they figure they're going to make up for all they didn't get when they should have had a budget.  __label__40
we got a high pressure -- __label__39
that, {F uh, } -  __label__0
-- in high school, #   __label__1
<Laughter>  Really,   __label__11
{C but } down here, Louisiana has a bad reputation for their politicians and all.  __label__39
[  I, + {F uh, } I'm ] trying my best right now to pay off some of mine.   __label__39
<Laughter> That's right,   __label__7
{D well, } [ maybe, + maybe ] your husband could tape it for you sometime.  __label__8
{C but } I am a golfer.  __label__39
natural gas powered rather than, {F uh, } gasoline.  __label__39
so do I,   __label__7
{C and } today was the first game   __label__39
I remember there was about [ four, + five ] years ago.  __label__39
They have no idea why not, [ some, + some ]  of them, {D you know. }   __label__39
what do they get paid.  __label__32
I'm looking forward to this summer, {F uh, } NAKED GUN TWO AND A HALF is coming out.  __label__39
{D Well, } I'm with you.   __label__13
I have a gas card  and a Visa card.    __label__39
Especially when they're not quite to the age of understanding that they're hurting, {D you know, }   __label__40
[ [ I, + I ]  don't use, + [ I, + I ] seldom use ] anything harsher than seven dust, {D you know. }  __label__39
# Yeah,   __label__11
Uh-huh.   __label__7
{C so } -- __label__39
{C And, } {F uh, } we do, {F uh, } aerobics, for our cardiovascular fitness for thirty minutes   __label__39
By a [ man, +  man ] named Doctor Bittel,  B I T T E L <<spells it out>>   __label__1
What if we would have lost thousands of young men.   __label__32
Where you find that, {F uh, } {F uh, } {D you know, } certain people [ are +  actually  [ are, + are ] ] criminal in their disregard for [ it-, +  -- __label__40
{D Well, } I think just, also, {D you know, } the women's movement, too, has affected a lot of social change.  __label__40
[ That, +  {F uh, }   I ] hear they're hiring all over the place for that.  __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D You know, } we had three hundred thousand people without power.  __label__39
{C And, }  of course, they have the, {F um, } dumpsters, {F uh, } [ the, + the ] igloos.  __label__39
<Lipsmack>  # Yeah. #  __label__7
{E I mean } it's a little extra work.  __label__40
{C and then } we do electrical tests on them during the process,   __label__39
I let my wife take the checkbook,   __label__39
I think maybe there's too much responsibility put on the teachers to motivate these kids.   __label__40
I am a Golden retriever fan,  __label__39
How long ago?  __label__35
there's about six or eight guys that we use to go out for these games.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C so } we're just going to let them go,   __label__5
I was part-time   __label__39
# In Dallas I, # - __label__0
<Laughter> Newhart, <more laughing>.  __label__12
{C And } a lot of jurors, -  __label__40
{F Um. }  __label__0
{C but, } {F um, } I don't know do you like, -  __label__39
[ We, + we  ] throw more of it [ off -- __label__40
We're wearing something lightweight or no jacket because we're so used to running around like that.  __label__39
{D Well. }  In some cases we would,   __label__26
{C So } I guess we'll have to do it.  __label__39
that's, - __label__0
And didn't really put them draft for any particular spot.   __label__1
{C But } if you are rolling it over every three years, __label__40
{D Well, } part of that is the overcrowding of the court system.  __label__39
{D Well, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I'm ] living in a dream world,   __label__39
{C and } it cost me the twenty-five dollars.   __label__39
[ {C and, } + {C and so } ]  they were so upset from robbing this guy, {D you know, } trying to do this holdup that didn't work that they quite literally were mad and went into a restaurant to hold the place up and just started, {D you know, } shooting people.  __label__39
{C but, } __label__39
he makes the, -  __label__39
Right.  __label__11
{F Uh, } for a good, -  __label__0
{C And } I guess I was close to eighteen or something.   __label__39
s-, - __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
[ Ha-, + we have  ] a lot of people moving here from Boston  [ and, + and ]  different areas   __label__39
it's free inside the company,   __label__39
{D You know } <laughter>, I've just got to deal, with all those other things that happen   __label__39
We have that here, too,   __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
Really?  __label__17
You'll have nightmares, {D you know. }   __label__40
{D Well, } he won't pull weeds.   __label__39
They were into it.  __label__39
{C So } I guess it would be like anything else.  __label__40
that's for sure.   __label__13
{C And } my husband had a lot of heartburn with that.  __label__39
Yeah,   __label__31
{C and } I keep the keys with me.  __label__39
<Static> <Children> {D So, }  how do you feel about capital punishment?  __label__33
I understand.  __label__39
{C and } who's going to decide which is how bad, {D you know, } -  __label__32
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I'm sure.  __label__39
those are pretty neat.   __label__7
{C And, }  for me, there's absolutely no question what's the most important benefit <laughter>   __label__39
{C and } that was sort of miserable.   __label__39
{C and } I wonder [ [ if, + {F uh, } if there's really, ] + {F um, } if the system ] works adequately [ in, + in ] educating the jurors about, {F uh, } whatever, {F um, } {D you know, } issue is under discussion.  __label__40
{F Oh, } I see,   __label__18
All right,   __label__11
[ and, + and ] so that they're not playing with it and so that they can't hurt themselves or anyone else playing with it.   __label__40
Yes,   __label__7
Maybe this pre group of people could decide, {D you know, } [ which kind of, + {F uh, } {D you know, } where they could go ] from there.   __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{E I mean } [ the first, + you can imagine the first, ] {F uh, } chemical weapon used --  __label__40
getting them there [ and then, + and  ] going to work, and then picking them up and, __label__39
{F Uh, } it's kind of a, <laughter> -  __label__39
{C and } he said it was the best thing he'd ever seen --  __label__39
it is.  __label__39
Right.  __label__11
I had a cousin who lived in White Plains,   __label__39
{C And } [ I just, + {F uh, } he ] lives with different, {D you know, } people in the family.   __label__39
{C Because } Texan philosophy is a little different.  __label__40
every youth that's ever gone really has felt that their life has been changed   __label__39
{F Uh, } [ my, + my ] solution  [ to, + to ] part  of this [ is, + is ] [ to, + to ] make it [ a-a-an, + an ] economic incentive for people to vote.   __label__40
<Lipsmack> {D See, that's } hard.  __label__14
{C and } they had a real good time   __label__39
{C But } I would love to, {F uh, } go into the space shuttle some day and, {F uh, } just see, {F uh, } {D you know, } the earth and the different planets and  things like that.   __label__39
{C so } just at the time all this happened, the door bell rang   __label__39
One of the benefits we get, of course,  is travel # <laughter>. #  __label__39
Do you like to cook?  __label__37
then playing football this fall, __label__39
Okay,   __label__22
{F Um. }  __label__11
<Laughter>. __label__43
{F oh } definitely <laughter>.   __label__26
# Uh-huh.  #  __label__11
{F Oh, } you bet,   __label__7
{F Uh, } he made kind of an odd sounding ROBIN HOOD,   __label__39
Yes,   __label__31
[ {C and, } + __label__39
it seemed like, {F uh, } -  __label__40
yeah  <laughter>.   __label__7
Uh-huh.  __label__11
[ I,  + {F uh, } I ] get calls at work,   __label__39
-- {C but } I'm originally from San Antonio --  __label__39
I, {F uh, } - __label__0
Uh-huh,   __label__11
<Laughter>  No,   __label__14
you take care,  __label__22
Yeah.   __label__11
{D well, } some of the things I like to do are, -  __label__39
Right.   __label__11
{D you know } [ that, + it ] just doesn't even give you the effect,   __label__40
In where  (( Rome )) , New York?  __label__19
WONDER YEARS?  __label__37
especially with [ the, +  being in on the ] creative  [ a-, + aspect ] and the crafty end.   __label__1
Yeah.   __label__11
[ It's, + {F uh, } it's ] okay.   __label__39
{C and } [ they're, + ] {F uh, }  the paint has, {F uh, } kind of faded and deteriorated,   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{C And } [ it, +  ((   )) ,  <throat_clearing> {E I mean } everything ] was sopping wet inside the tent.   __label__39
[ {C and, } +  {C and } ] your name was Lisa.  __label__38
{D like } I don't know what they're called,   __label__39
{C and, }  {D well, } [ I, + I  ] have [ the, + {F uh, } the  ] H O M A   __label__39
{C and } he works {D like } four days on   __label__39
[ it's, + it's, ] -  __label__0
{F Oh, } gosh.   __label__13
People are pretty surprised that [ they, + {E I mean } they ] beat the Giants.  __label__40
-- {C but } they never say [ who, + who  ] they're really working for or  [ [ [ what + <throat_clearing>, {D you know, } what  ] +  -- __label__40
{C and } I really liked it,   __label__39
{F Uh-, } yeah.  __label__11
yeah.  __label__7
they did.  __label__7
That was what they had told their, __label__39
Yes.   __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F Oh, } <laughter> yeah.  <sniffing>   __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
{F Oh, } really?  __label__17
Whereas it would have been, - __label__40
Yeah.  __label__11
{D You know, }  {C so } [ [ that's, + that's, ] + that's, ] -  __label__0
I guess people just kind of keep their noses pointed in their own business,   __label__40
legitimate ] appeal, __label__1

I do too.   __label__39
[ {C And } + {D you know, } {C and then } ] [ what, + ]  those problems has been eliminated   __label__39
# [ It is, + it's ] # aerobics   __label__26
Not a whole lot.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I'm not real, -  __label__0
I know when I was working, you know, you have all these problems with, with the child care and, and with, uh, pleasing, you know, your boss on the job,   __label__40
one guy practically roasted a goat [ in his, + in his  ] dorm   __label__39
Did they, - __label__0
-- they've had some impact, but not a tremendous amount,   __label__1
just all over the place.   __label__39
[ [ you, +  you could, ] +   you could ] never bring them back.  __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
-- {C and } they final get up to where they kill somebody else,   __label__40
Right.  __label__11
{C But, } {F um, } they're definitely enjoyable.  __label__39
Sometimes it might be the candlelight   __label__16
That's a [ rather, + rather ] broad topic <laughter>.  __label__40
flan is something you can, __label__39
in fact, what I'm driving right now, -  __label__39
{C And } I think  that, that   is probably the most aggravating <laughter>.  __label__40

this is Laurie,   __label__23
it's real easy to spend other people's money.   __label__37
{C and, } {F uh, } we've had him about four years now.  __label__39

No.   __label__10
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ] __label__40
To a parent?  __label__37
{C so } then you had to.  __label__16
{C But, } golly!  __label__13
[ I've, + I've, ] {F uh, } made some small things, cross stitch things.   __label__39
Which means it's, {D you know, } very difficult for some-, -  __label__1
{D Well, } that's for sure.  __label__7
{C but } I'm, __label__39

{D well, } [ [ that's, + that's, ] + __label__39
-- {C and then, } {D you know, } ten months later he said, {D well, } sorry, {D you know, } I, I can't follow through on this.   *[[sd(^q))]] __label__1

# Yes.  #  __label__11

{D Well, } I just, -  __label__0
[ Did that, + did that ] seem to,   __label__38

-- at this.  __label__1
[ [ [ I, + I, ] + I'm, ] + I'm ] thinking  of actually moving to Australia   __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
You most likely will.  __label__40

{C But, } {F uh, } I don't know,   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F Uh. }  __label__0
Yeah.  __label__11
{C And, } I saw areas that they had not shown me   __label__39
Yeah.   __label__22
{C and then } he examines you.  __label__39
the price already drops in half.  __label__40
something that it doesn't matter if it gets spit up on, too <laughter>.  __label__16
It was just nice.   __label__40
No big deal.  __label__1
<Lipsmack> [ {C But } + {C and } ] I've been out trying to find a job because this is <noise> just not cutting it.  __label__39

Right,   __label__7
<Laughter>.   *[[slash error]] __label__43

{D Well, } good talking to you too.   __label__22
{C so } I figured it wasn't, {F uh, } something I needed at this point in time.  __label__39

{C but } you don't go making billions of dollars of loans in,  to people that you can just look at the situation,  __label__40
{C and } they have this whole team, {D you know, } analyze why they came in last right. Because the  (( person ))  asked for it.  __label__39
{C so. } - __label__0
{D Well, } actually, I love the car I have.   __label__39
of course you fill them all out because you're honored.  __label__40
I'm getting to the point where, {D you know, } [ I watch, + {D well } I watch ] NICK AT NIGHT.  __label__39

# <Laughter>. # __label__43

[  My, {F uh, } + I ] had four brothers   __label__39

it was.  Because we're here eighteen years --  __label__39

[ If I can't swim + {E or }  I can't run, ] I should be able to swim.   __label__39

-- {C but, } {F uh, } now I notice that [ this, + in this ] small city that I live in, they do have [ a, + a ] gym that just opened up here about a month ago.  __label__39
{C So, } - __label__0
[ {C and, } + {C and } ]  I feel like, {D you know, } -  __label__0
Ooh.  __label__11
{C But } I meant for some, when both parties agreed that yes, we're going to have a judge here.   __label__40
That is my problem.   __label__39
Yes.  __label__31
Well, that'd work to a point because some kids are just bad anyway.   __label__40
I had never been [ out of, + {D really, } out of ] Texas or out of Indiana much, out of the United States.   __label__39

-- if it's, {D you know, } -  __label__1

{F Uh, } it is twenty minutes to nine.  __label__39

{C so } I'm -- __label__39
Huh.  __label__1

Oh.  __label__11
I don't know that, - __label__0

[ And, + ] like, how many kids you had, and who you had married,   __label__1

[ {C but. } +  {C Because } ] my mother had six girls,   __label__39

Atlanta is horrible.  __label__39

I don't know,   __label__25
Cindy, you there?  __label__37
Uh-huh.  __label__11
# Uh-huh. #  __label__11
What are you hoping for, a boy or a girl?  __label__37
Yeah.   __label__11
Yeah,   __label__31
eventually [ the, + ] [ you will, + you will ]  be doing lots of stuff.   __label__1
[ She, + she ] did very well in school   __label__39
<Throat_clearing> Yeah,   __label__11
you'd have  to probably almost go out   __label__40
{C and } sometimes, I think, {F um, } {D well, } for myself, that income that we have, we pay a certain salary,   __label__40
Uh, we have to, uh, we have to have a state inspection every year.  __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
On all of the islands.  {D You know, }   __label__1
{F Um. }  __label__11
no.   __label__29
{C but } <throat_clearing> [ it's +  it is ] instrumental.   __label__39
Do you think this is vital important?  __label__37
# [ For, + for ] # honest mistakes where they've done something [ and, + and ] something happens.   __label__39
If they are losing money, then they're going to raise rates.  __label__39
[ I, + I'm ] young,   __label__39
if we were in a wreck, {D you know, } you can be sued for anything now.   __label__40
-- {C but, } {D you know, } it's pretty hard to try, {A let's say, } the man down the street that's living on Social Security or somebody that's on a  limited income to be tried by a jury of his peers if most of the people, -  __label__40
{C And } it's something good to have on hand, too.   __label__40
{F Uh, } my husband works for, {F uh, }  Texas Instruments.  __label__39
{C But, }  {F uh, } of course I'm away from my other son those hours, too.   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{C and } <throat_clearing> they are, like I say right on the beach.   __label__39
{C or } at least began, was in the talking sta-, - __label__39
{D Well, } I'm real curious because my family,   __label__39
{C But, } {F uh, }  {F uh, } I enjoy, {F uh, } {F uh, } a lot of different comedies.   __label__39
The three oh five was [ that, + that, ] __label__39
{F Uh, }  __label__0
{C But } now, we are trying to go back to about the sixties, [ when the parents, + {D you know, } when the mother ] was staying at home.  __label__39
I wouldn't even mind being <laughter> not so much being first but just, {F uh, } get out there [ and, +  and ] just explore.  __label__39
it's twenty-two percent interest.  __label__1
That's very spicy, too.  __label__16
{F Uh, } I don't know,   __label__30
-- # {C but, } {F uh, } # [ I, + I ] fully agree with it   __label__39
Do you have children?  __label__37
Right --  __label__11
{C but } it's because you've been there. __label__40
# {C And, } {F uh, } # this has been one of my pet peeves and probably why I went into education.   __label__39
{C But, }  {D man, } [ I, + I ] just think of all  of the money [ that they, + that they're ] going to have to spend just getting that.   __label__39
and, [ [ hu-, + hu-, ] + hung ] my fingernails in the net in volleyball.  __label__1
what was that one about Bob?  __label__35
Thanks.  __label__24
Yeah,   __label__11
right <laughter>.   __label__7
Okay.  __label__11
sometimes [ he bri-, + he brought ] home [ a, + {F uh, } a ] portable one,  __label__39
-- as [ if, + {F uh, } if ] you get something back for it.   {D You know. }  __label__1
Okay.  __label__22
{C So } about fifteen years ago the German Shepherd  Club of America decided amongst themselves that they were going to change this.   __label__39
you can't really tell,   __label__40
I don't know what you'd call it other than on line.   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
I'm pretty much the same way.   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
Your, - __label__0
{D Well, } I'm not planning the menu.  __label__39
Right.  __label__11
[ I, + I  ] really can't say anything that would really bother me.  __label__39
{F Oh, } I, {F uh, } like sports type things too.   __label__39
It does not make for a happy situation.   __label__40
Yeah,   __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D Well, } I had, {F uh, } a little routine that I did for warm ups.  __label__39
and we were going to get a Olds eighty-eight or something.   __label__39
Gosh [ that's, + that sounds ] pretty bad to me.   __label__40
{C So } I got an opportunity to transfer back,   __label__39
-- my particular area, the homes run anywhere from  about sixty-five, eighty thousand dollars on up to probably half a million.  __label__1
{F Uh, } I have a tendency to, -  __label__0
# stuff # like that.   __label__1
Yeah,   __label__7
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ] __label__40
I see.  __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
of course I think, Saddam Hussein only allowed C N N to broadcast it,   __label__40
My wife and I both have had  that recently.  __label__39
-- [ {C and, } + {C and } ] my grandfather came to Bell County on a covered wagon -- __label__4
{C and, } {F uh, } it's good to hear from you   __label__22
{C And } there's a lot of anger, {D sure. } {D You know, } especially if they haven't went through treatment   __label__40
# Yeah,   __label__11
It's [ very complex, + very complicated, ]   __label__40
uh-huh.  __label__11
{F Oh, } yeah,   __label__31
Yeah.   __label__7
Unfortunately, there are a lot of people that just don't care   __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
# Uh-huh. #  __label__11
# {D you # know, } who just end up using  things against us later on anyway.  __label__1
[ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {C but, } ]  <laughter> they don't always work   __label__40
We just bought a new house.   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{D well }  she'll be four in  September and then a little boy that's just turned two.  __label__39
we thought even with all the cold weather weather we have had they have been blooming just fine.  __label__40
[ we don't, + we haven't ] been doing layoffs.   __label__39
[ {C and, } + {C and } ]  we had, {F uh, } [ collapsible boat [ which we, + ] + [ clipper, +  little clipper ] sail boat. ]  __label__39
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] [ it, + indeed it ] has proved out that way,   __label__39
{C and }  one of the three of us has an accounting background   __label__39
No.  __label__29
{F Uh, } {C and } they're already, -  __label__0
{D Well, } [ th-, +  that's ] certainly, -  __label__0
Right.  __label__11
What do you do?  __label__35
uh-huh.  __label__11
[ the, + the, ] -  __label__0
Detroit?  __label__19
I, -  __label__0
{D Well } there are mini skirts and there are mini skirts.  __label__40
one of the reasons that I'm against it is that, {F uh, } {F um, } I'm afraid of someone losing their life, for [ s-, + ] {F um, } # wrongly, #  __label__39
Big time there, sure is.  __label__40
{C So, }  we thought {D well, } maybe there are some crab in here,   __label__39
Right.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
-- practical purpose, you are almost a hundred percent covered.  __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
My wife took my daughters one year when they were getting some points for school, took them to an elderly home,   __label__39
-- {C and then } they go off to some other hole   __label__39
One of the advantages of not having pitchers who are -- - __label__40
Okay,  Geri.   __label__14
But, uh, as far as, as far as, you know, Central and South America, we, our policy pretty much, uh, it depends on who we're, what government we're buying down there at the particular time.  __label__40
{C But } [ it, + it ] sounds like you are, {F uh, } {D you know, } __label__40
Okay.  __label__22
# Yeah,   __label__11
That's what I do with a lot of my daughter's things is I'll store [ her, + {D you know, } {D like } her ] out dated or, [  out of, + out of ] season clothes in them   __label__39
-- from ] that point on, I became so anti drunk driving -- __label__1
{D Well } [ I, + I ] appreciate the fa-, -  __label__0
American cars, a lot of people say [ they, + they ] don't last long   __label__39
-- {C and } ] that would make any  parent feel good and bad at the same time, {D you know, }   __label__1
{C And then, } when they collect them at  the end of each week, they get to go to this little, what they call their caught being good store,   __label__39
to drive all the way to some recycling center  to turn in just your little plastic peanuts <laughter>.  __label__1
Uh-huh <<faint>>.  __label__11
{C Because } what happened is, {D like } they have this hologram right, __label__39
Right.  __label__11
{C so. } # - __label__0
-- so we've been out here, {D well, } really in the  house since December,   __label__1
-- things like that I like to listen to.   __label__39
There's the Apostle Islands, {F uh } -- __label__39
{D now } that's got that big V eight engine in it, [ doesn't it, + doesn't it? ]  __label__37
It was nice.   __label__39
{E I mean } they're going to, -  __label__40
{C but } you kind of get, I guess, into a little routine, {D you know, } where it [ becomes, + is ] automatic, {D now, } to throw, __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and } I think the last one I read  like that was Scott Thurow's   __label__39
Isn't it strange how people are fascinated by other people that they think are strange <laughter>?  __label__37
{C and, }  {F uh, } we put him in Amrein's Day Care, [ after. + __label__39
Right.   __label__11
{F Uh, }  __label__0
{F Oh, } yeah.  __label__11
Right,   __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C But } our neighborhood has [ a, + just a ]  wide variety [ of, + of, ] {F um, } people,   __label__39
this is the last week.   __label__39
Yes.   __label__7
[ that, +  that ] -  __label__0
I know when you get the kids that have gone the summer being out of school, then it's like  they've lost so much ground, we spend at least the first six weeks just backing up, reteaching what they had the year before.  {D You know. }  __label__40
Huh-uh, {D you know. }   __label__7
you hope <laughter>.   __label__7
-- {C but } by the time I was nineteen my  opinion had totally changed.  __label__39
# {C and } the, # - __label__0
{F Uh, } {C and } frankly, it's the way  that men are.   __label__40
I think it would be really. __label__40
{D Say, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] would think [ [ that, + {F um, } that, ] + that ] people like that,   __label__39
Yeah.   __label__7
{C So, } {F uh, } I am not too upset.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F Uh, } {D you know, } the character that, {F uh, } James Earle Jones played?  __label__39
{D Well, } {D you know, } on Friday  nights especially, we like to watch TWENTY TWENTY.  __label__39
-- <Laughter> I really do like it a lot.  <sniffing>   __label__1
yeah,   __label__7
I think, __label__40
Yeah.  __label__11
{C So, } therefore, I don't believe there could be a single government for the whole world.   __label__39
{C and } -- __label__22
{C but } it's very, very high in cholesterol,  I am sure with all the eggs that are in it.  __label__39
-- like T I has Texans?  __label__1
[ I, +  I ] don't know what Foley's is <laughter>.  __label__39
-- from that for the person or for society to me is wrong too.  __label__1
No.   __label__7
[  The, + {F uh, } the ] movie, THE DOORS, has [ so-, + some ] nice desert scenes,   __label__39
Yes.  __label__31
What's that?  __label__19
Uh-huh,   __label__7
{C and } want to develop that.  __label__2
Yeah.   __label__11
They could be a good idea to, -  __label__13
It curbs the appetite  and helps with the calories and all that stuff.  __label__40
-- <Inhaling> I haven't really been taking it out, __label__1
{C and, } {F uh, } it was, -  __label__0
{D Well, } {F um, } I seem to always be in [ the, + the ] next to the last generation of word processing software.   __label__30
feel  ] differently.  __label__1
Yes.   __label__11
# Yeah.   __label__7
{C And } we had some wonderful, wonderful years there under Roger (( Staubach )) .  __label__39
# Uh-huh. #  __label__11
and race relations and things like that,   __label__1
# and # to put it on my plants.  Which I had never thought about before.  __label__1
[ I, + I ] agree.   __label__7
that [ it, + it ] really surprises me because of the cost savings.   __label__1
I don't believe there's been, {D you know, } much trouble in our neighborhood, #   __label__39
yeah,   __label__7
Mine, -  __label__0
[  It, + it's ] still got a long way to go.  __label__40
{C and, } __label__39
and dropped it for a long time [ [ when, + __label__1
you hear this as an excuse,   __label__40
-- that does not look like a restaurant  that you would really want to recommend to a lot of people.  __label__1
{D Anyway, } he always has {D like } really strange shows like, {F uh, } <breathing> {F uh, } <throat_clearing> male strippers or female strippers or  <laughter> just -- __label__39
{D Well, } I killed it pretty quick.  __label__39
{C but } she enjoys eating out,   __label__39
{C And } it gets like twenty-six miles to the gallon on the road.  __label__39
{C But, }  {F uh, } I don't have any plans for probably another two, three years of even looking, {D you know. }  __label__39
<Laughter> That's right <laughter>.  __label__7
<Laughter>. __label__43
{F Uh, } when I went to school, I know I was scared to death -- __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and } if you needed another pound of freon they ga-, -  __label__39
also.  __label__1
{D Well, } mostly, {F uh, } [ a, + a ] little fresh water fish,   __label__39
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] I said, {D well, } {D you know, } that was okay.   __label__39
Huh.  __label__11
I have a eighteen year old son.   __label__39
[ {C but, } + {C but }  ] somebody told me that they were charging as much for it as they did for straw. __label__39
I got customers in Oklahoma City and Tulsa and # Perry, Oklahoma # -- __label__39
yeah.  __label__11
{C but, }  {F uh, } my wife thought she wanted to get a Ford Mustang   __label__39
{C but } [ I, + I ] don't carry a lot of cash with me, because I'm -- __label__39
Yeah,  __label__7
I tape it.  __label__26
# [ We had, + # {F uh, } we had ] organizations like that in college, {D you know. }   __label__39
I guess we've kind of exhausted this one,   __label__22
{C but } [ I, + I ] do want to add this to  that, because [ I, + I ] was quite interested in that myself,  __label__39
you better have some other way of, {F uh, } savings,   __label__40
{C so } they're trying to lower them.  __label__39
{D You know, } this kind of stuff.  __label__1
yeah.  __label__11
{C And, } __label__39
Yes,   __label__7
Yeah.  __label__11
{F Uh, } I don't know,   __label__39
# {C and } was, -  __label__0
yeah   __label__11
{C And } [ there's, + there's ] so many other things that, [ I, + I ] have done, {D you know, } in the meantime, like I said, so many baby gifts.   __label__39
We tried for a while   __label__39
I was wondering how, - __label__36
Yeah,   __label__11
{F Oh, } I'm sure it is.  __label__13
There's no official document signed or anything?  __label__38
[ I'm envious, + __label__39
families,   __label__12
No   __label__29
I like that.   __label__39
-- {C but } it was a preponderance of them that caused our problem.    __label__39
I don't enjoy preparing three meals a day everyday <laughter>.  __label__39
-- all the newspapers ] -- __label__1
Huh.   *[[ See note above ]] __label__1
That's coming up,   __label__22
(( They can just ))  subtract it from your bill,  __label__39
# Yeah. #  __label__11
{C And } {D you know, } [ when, + {F um, } when ] last year the elections were going, on the governors election and state and, {D you know. } -  __label__39
shoot, I can't remember them all now.  __label__39
yeah   __label__7
-- {F uh, } in a place like that.   Particularly, since I know how they feel about it.  __label__1
{D Well, } one thing that's  kind of different, too, though,  a preschool [ than, + than ] taking [ a, + a ] infant [ or -- + ] __label__40
Huh.   __label__11
I can remember it not, -  __label__39
{C and } I think with, {F uh, } {F um, } this, it seems like it's more the upper-class people,  __label__40
{D you know, } in case ] you ever need to bail out <laughter>.  __label__1
No,   __label__29
{C but } adults, if they're strange to her, [ or, + or ]  they look suspicious or  something, {D boy } she acts like she wants to chew their leg off.  __label__39
{E I mean, } maybe, one snow.  __label__39
you can't really  be sure of the quality of what you've got, {D you know. }  __label__40
tha-, -  __label__0
I do.  #  __label__39
{D so, }  {F uh, } {D well, } {F uh, }  what kind of vacations do you like?  __label__35
it's really sad.  __label__40
you could interpret it that way.  __label__40
I have a daughter.  __label__39
<Laughter> Every time the sun would come up in the  morning I'd see another spot and have to drag out the paint can.   __label__39
but also, -  __label__0
Yeah.  __label__31
Goll-, times goes fast.  __label__40
<Laughter>. __label__43
{C but } I put all the money into it.  __label__39
{C And } [ I, + I ] guess [ there's some, + there's, {F uh, } {F uh, } some ] negotiating there, too,  __label__39
<Clicking> {D Well } I haven't had an awful lot of, {F uh, } incidents regarding child care.   __label__39
{F Um, }  MADAM BUTTERFLY was, {F um, } __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
it's  not my choice for [ when, +  when ]  I have children   __label__39
{C and so, } that was very helpful to me as far as books.   __label__39
Where people aren't really, {D you know, } eco conscious. It's just the fact that it's something they have to do.   __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
It's far beyond me.  __label__40
{C but } -- - __label__0
[ You don't, + {F uh, } you're not ] [ in-, + __label__38
the fire was terrible,   __label__39
Boy -- __label__40
{C and } we still know now that we have this car to put all the miles on.  __label__39
{C and, then } the cover version, [ I think, + {E I mean, } I thought, ] [  was absolutely, + it was pitiful. ]  __label__40
{D well } I had one while I was pregnant,   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
yeah.   __label__0
# we # did what we could   __label__1
{C but } the key is to always have your line tight.  __label__39
making it unanimous sometimes [ might, {F uh, } let, + {A the only thing, } it might let ] more people get off.   __label__40
{F Oh, } does it?   __label__17
[ {C and } + {C but, } ] - __label__0
{C and } [ they, + they ]  gave  him the seat that normally  belongs to John Bel John <<spelled phonetically>>.   __label__39
<Sniffing> Uh-huh.  __label__11
It's seems like people go for square footage only now --  __label__40
in, +  control it, ]   __label__1
{C and } what they were pleading was, {F um, } they were pleading insanity.  __label__39
Right.   __label__11
I saw something the other night about it.  __label__39
Right.   __label__26
Yeah,   __label__0
{F Uh, } <talking> {C and } [ it's, + it's ] kind of small in a sense   __label__39
I have known a lot of people that would go to school and their parents paid for it   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
a lot of [ the, + my ] family, {D you know, } they fear me working like that and, under [ some, + some ] of those conditions,   __label__39
We really do.  __label__40
{F Uh, } another reason was, {F uh, } I paid for my entire education. __label__39
{D You know. }  __label__1
[ I, + I ] don't know.   __label__30
they don't even consider it. #  __label__40
How do you feel about gun control?  __label__33
Yeah <laughter>.  __label__11
{C and } we have a  lot of government folks come in all the time   __label__39
{F Uh, } {C and } I only update that, {F oh } I don't know, maybe once every quarter or so. Every three months. Just, basically when the statements come in. __label__39
-- so they wouldn't be as thick, [ then + ] she'd give me some of the bulbs.   __label__1
what they have out for {D like } the next year, is everything still pretty square,   __label__37
{C and } we checked it out,  __label__39
{C And, }  {F uh, } sometimes we'll go, {D you know, }   __label__39
I don't have the equipment here.   __label__39
{C And } I really feel kind of guilty for not working out more than I do because there's a facility right downstairs where [ all, + {D you know, } all ] we have to do [ is, + is, ] {F uh, } run down there   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__7
{C and } we normally manage to eat out once a week anyway.  __label__39
we have, {F uh, } -  __label__0
{C but, } {F uh, } my father-in-law's been involved in, {F uh, }  several trials including, {F uh, } a couple murders.   And, {F uh, } {D you know, } talking to  other people who have been there   __label__39
{C But, } {D you know, } we do a lot of robbing Peter to pay Paul.   __label__39
<Noise>. __label__43
Yeah,   __label__11
{C and } I'm sure that any of them would have [ cost  al-, + {E or } charged ] me almost the same amount.   __label__40
[ It's, + it ] started, I think, a little bit before that   __label__40
That is about the last time I have been through Marlin and Mart <laughter>.  __label__39
{C So, } {F uh, } our insurance paid for everything,   __label__39
I can fix   __label__1
{F Oh, } [ much -- + __label__7
Eighty-six?  __label__12
been applicable to me   __label__1
{D You know } [ the, + the ] other thought that I had, {F uh, } -  __label__39
[ We, +  {F um, } as I said, living in an area of Washington, D C. __label__39
Right.  __label__26
{D Well, } I would like to, {F uh, }  stay at home with my children for at least the first five years.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and then } no one  knew English in there,   __label__39
{D Well, } great.   __label__13
Right.  __label__11
{D like } my since is it was there to try to protect small investors   __label__40
{C and } my wife's hollering at me and  wondering what else I've come home with from work this time [ to, + to ]  put in, a ceiling fan or something strange like that.   __label__39
Right,   __label__11
As you whip it, over your head, __label__39
I've been thinking it's getting cold sooner than normal.   __label__40
-- it wouldn't surprise me,  __label__1
[ They, + they ] redecorated in nineteen seventy-five, {D you know. }  __label__39
{D Well, } that's something about what Germany's supposed to be doing. Something similar to that right now.   __label__40
I'm not too big on cars.   __label__39
{C so. }   Yeah,   __label__11
It was -- __label__39
in Chicago <laughter>, __label__39
{C But } ours is more like month to month too, {F uh, }   __label__39
{C So } I enjoy it,   __label__39
[ {C and } it, + {F uh, } __label__39
no   __label__29
#But, -  __label__0
No,   __label__7
Yeah.  __label__11
I agree with you on that particular subject there.   __label__7
{C and } -- __label__39
they didn't necessarily say  buy it new they just said, __label__39
they have the best of both worlds.   __label__40
-- for {D like } smog and stuff?  __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D Well, } that sounds interesting.   __label__40
curbside recycling,  __label__1
I know what you mean.   __label__39
{C And then the } third one that he came out  with is now called HOMECOMING <noise>.   __label__39
He was a little surprised.  __label__39
{F Oh, } of course <laughter>.  __label__7
it was nice to go there,   __label__40
or a dependent of one.  __label__2
we have that problem too.  __label__39
Yes.  __label__11
# Bye-bye. #  __label__22
uh-huh.  #  __label__11
{F Uh, } no,   __label__26
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and } <noise> probably the one I liked most was Hawaii <laughter>.  __label__39
It's amazing that people actually, -  __label__40
and we went up to the local Budget   __label__39
{C and } I know there's still a hundred things I don't know how to do on it.  __label__39
Right.  __label__11
[ I just, +  I just ] don't think there's  a place in our environment, {D you know } in the work force for drugs, or alcohol either.  __label__40
Just don't mind me if I bounce back and forth.  __label__8
she's frustrated.  __label__39
{C And } [ it, +  it ] takes a lot of care   __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
-- {D you know, }   __label__1
Yes.  __label__7
{F Oh } really.  __label__11
{D well, } {F um, } I think we have been talking probably about four and a half minutes.  __label__22
{D Well, } do you use credit cards?  __label__37
With all these lawsuits and people suing people over ridiculous things -  __label__39
I've done some [ cross, + {F um, } cross ] stitch,   __label__39
That's the kind of things # that throw you off.  __label__40
Oh,  __label__4
{C and } by the time  the next round comes in I'm still not through reading <laughter> the first round.  __label__39
It was really suspenseful.   __label__39
No,   __label__29
# Yeah. #  __label__11
[ {C and, } {D you know } -- __label__39
# <Popping> Yeah.   __label__7
magazine companies, {F uh, } {F uh, }  [ from, + from ] subscriptions do the same thing --  __label__39
-- about random testing.  __label__1
{C and } I thought I had seen,   when we were traveling around the state,  some similar signs up that indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up   __label__39
{C but, }  {F uh, } [ it, + it ] quit working   __label__39
you <ringing> think you'd really enjoy it?  __label__37
{C so } -- __label__40
{C and, } {D you know, } they experience a lot more.  __label__39
um, they, uh, -  __label__0
{C and } [ they, +  {D you know, } they ]  finished the basement,   __label__39
No,   __label__29
singer,   __label__1
{C and then } the rest is whatever you want to put in.  If you put more than that or something like that.  __label__39
it's more they're not enforcing the death penalty itself.   __label__40
[ I, + I ] never pay finance charges on  them except when I screw up which I occasionally <laughter> do.  __label__39
# realistically, {D you know, } # [ [ we had, + we really had  to start, ] + we have to start ] recycling in [ some, + some, ] {F uh, } geographic areas.   __label__1
No.  __label__29
<Laughter> Yeah.   __label__31
Kalachandji's.   __label__39
[ I would not of, + {D okay, } I would not have ] guessed that in Seattle.  __label__40
Social change is always going to go on,   __label__40
<Laughter> How fun.  __label__13
They just wouldn't be able to own the kind of automobiles that they think they deserve to own.  Or the kind of homes that  we think we deserve to own.   __label__40
{C but, }  {F uh, } {D actually } not selling  (( it )) , -  __label__39
{C But, } {F uh, } I, {F uh, } fo-, -  __label__0
Uh-huh,   __label__11
{C so } we swam a lot   __label__39
I don't take a subscription or  anything like that.   __label__39
Yes,   __label__7
[ I, + I ] hate to cut it off,   __label__39
{D you know, } {F oh, } that was really great.   __label__5
and his social security number.  __label__1
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] that's all right with me, because I don't want to stay home --  __label__39
{C and } I'll do the potatoes and {D you know, } {D like } butter and cheese and stuff  and have everybody else just bring a couple of toppings, whatever they like --  __label__39
Yeah,   __label__31
People are being [ [ a little more, + {F oh, } I don't know, a little le-, ] + a little less ] bigoted in some ways,   __label__40
I don't like the country music that's like my wife left me, # my dog # -- __label__39
Bye-bye.  __label__22
I've got [ a, + a ] six year old and a, {F um, } -  __label__39
by all means.   __label__13
{D Well, } thank you.   __label__22
Oh,   __label__11
Okay.   __label__14
{C so, } {F uh, }  I've read a lot of information, # knowing that to be true, #  __label__39
# {F Uh, } #   __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Espec-, - __label__0
#  It's, ] + it's ] religious # based   __label__1
-- [ and, + and ] if another alternative was -- __label__1
-- after my kids started to school -- __label__1
Has to be on the hip?  __label__37
I bet it tastes good too.  __label__38
I did press one,   __label__26
{C  so } it became quite a big -- __label__39
{C and } they really don't help you a whole lot.   __label__40
{D You, __label__40
I like to be able to eat really healthy,   __label__39
Right.  __label__11
uh-huh.   __label__11
{D Now } [ that, + ] [ do you, + do you ] agree, that they should all be unanimous?  __label__37
Yeah,   __label__11
Yeah.   __label__7
too, __label__1
# Exactly.  #  __label__13
# Yeah   __label__7
{C but } then we came here and they had parking lots in the schools   __label__39
-- {C so } I have three children, {F um, } [ fifteen, + ages fifteen, ] seventeen and  twenty --  __label__39
of my friends who [ have, +  have ]  children, {F uh, } -  __label__39
Right.   __label__7
{C so. } # - __label__0
She's two months now, nine weeks.  __label__39
If I was in a public restaurant, seated at table with, {F uh, }  non smokers   I would try to pick    [ a s-, +  [ [ a, +   a ] +  my, ] seat ] where the smoke would blow away from them.   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
-- each month. __label__1
Yeah.  __label__11
{C And } [ let's, + {D you know, } let's ] get rid of some of this harassment suing.  __label__40
Right,   __label__7
{C so } I just switched the channel up on it.   __label__39
Good luck.  __label__22
short trips.   __label__39
That's true.  __label__7
you really want to say [ you think, or + ] what you think should be done,  or how you think this court case should have gone,   __label__39
{D You know, } Schwartzkopf was ordered to get Iraq out of Kuwait.  __label__39
He said that when he graduated, the day after his bar examine -- __label__39
{C but } I've always worked on a university level   __label__39
food restaurant.  __label__1
# to talk to # you.  __label__1
Yeah.  __label__7
[ [ I don't, + I don't,  ] + I don't  ] even know what to do about that sort of thing.  __label__39
{F Oh, } okay.  __label__18
I, I read to them a lot.  __label__39
{F Oh. }  __label__11
{C And } I told my husband,   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{C And } I realize that.  __label__39
[ It's, +  {D yeah, } it's ] really bad.  __label__31
I do keep my, - __label__39
{C and } it's not really that they've changed their musical style so much as the stream changed.  __label__40
there is too big of a concentration coming all at once [ to, + to ] allow for adequate melting into the society.  __label__40
I don't think we can really understand their attitude because there cultures are just so much different.  __label__40
Oh.  __label__11
apart from that, [ I, + I ] don't know what we can do as individuals.   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{C and } naturally these are cats,   __label__39
{C and then } I just fix little individual cups for them.   __label__39
# {C but then } # they went ahead and charged it on my account.  __label__39
Um, okay.  __label__11
that's quite a range.  __label__1
How about yours?  __label__33
Yeah.  __label__31
-- [ {C and so, } + {C and } ] that's back in the -- - __label__39
Yep,   __label__7
talking about mailing lists,  the <breathing>, -  __label__0
Exactly,   __label__7
I think right now it's like sixty-nine,  __label__39
the soil's probably so  good --  __label__40
{F Oh, } that's good.  __label__13
Yeah.  __label__11
{F Uh, } they don't really see past next week much less next year.  __label__40
Yeah.   __label__7
I'm into computers too   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__31
# Okay,   __label__14
that's why I got the Honda.  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
That's a fact,  __label__7
{C and, }  {F uh, } we've got about, - __label__0
{C But, } I think the U S is one of the few countries that still do.  __label__40
{C but } they're not going to grab you, steal [ you-, + your ] money and slit your throat -- __label__40
[ {C but, } + {D you know, } {C so }  ] it covers the emergency things  but it doesn't cover if you get sick --  __label__39
[ My, + my ] children all ski --  __label__39
-- and I place the call, this counts as your call.  __label__1
Yeah.   __label__11
It's just me in the house,   __label__39
I don't know that I read  anything strictly labeled self improvement.   __label__39
you, - __label__0
{C because } {D actually, } {F um, } when I was in college I visited Mexico several times,   __label__39
{C But } I guess you just tend to think [ of, + of  ] where your house is -- __label__40
Yeah,   __label__11
-- {D so. }  __label__0
I never watched KNOTS LANDING,   __label__39
{D well, } I think there are more than there used to be.  __label__40
<Cough>. __label__43
Yeah.  __label__31
-- long distance phone call.   __label__1
I live in Raleigh,   __label__39
{D Well, } thanks for talking.  __label__22
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } keep Congress to, {F um, } two terms of two years a piece --  __label__40
{C and, } {F uh, } [ [ it is, + it is more sig-, ] + it is more just significant ] information, {D you know. }   __label__40
{D you know, } kinds of professional activities you have at, {D you know, } work.  __label__1
{C and } I have got two kids.  __label__39
{C and } it's amazing [ what you can, + {D you know, } how many plants you can ] plant in there --  __label__39
--  {C and } they paid for everything.  __label__39
[ {C So, } + {C so, } ] -  __label__0
I'm from the north,   __label__39
uh-huh.  __label__31
Yeah,   __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
{C And, } {F uh, } he has had a couple of inches in his house several times.  __label__39
{C So } it's not very practical (( )).  __label__40
# and # what would we do with the money   __label__1
no, --  __label__29
it's going to be hard to, {F um, } -  __label__40
I do too   __label__7
What division you all in?  __label__35
Huh-uh.  __label__11
I guess that's a really [ true, +  true ] hobby,   __label__39
[ They, + {F uh, } last year they ]  had a really good team,   __label__40
uh-huh.  __label__11
[ I do not, + I do not ] know.   Because I am not real up on -- __label__30
if there's a door closed and you open it because it's in your way   __label__39
They wouldn't have understood anything  [ else + ] than what we did in the war.  __label__40
{C But, }  yeah,  __label__11
[ it's, + it's ] very important  for the economics [ of the whole, + of the ] Soviet Union.  __label__40
{C But, } Mike, our oldest boy, I think he would have.   __label__39
{C and } I enjoy reading and playing softball.  __label__39
I think those guys should be done away with.   __label__40
{C but }  I'm like you,   __label__39
[ [ I, + I,  ] + I,  ] -  __label__0
# [ {D So, } + {D so } ] how, # - __label__0
Let me see,   __label__4
All right.   __label__22
# Yeah. #  __label__11
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ] - __label__0
-- {C and } I need to, {D you know, } -  __label__39
{F Uh, } very seld-, - __label__0
-- {D you know, }   __label__1
if you pay it that way it, {E I mean, } [ it really is, + it's ] like getting a free loan for a while. __label__39
# {C but } you # figure you got some drug guy out  there that's got an Uzi machine gun,  {F uh, } __label__40
Yep.   __label__7
Yeah,   __label__11
I can remember that,   __label__39
{C And, } # - __label__0
The money is -- - __label__0
a little elitist is the NEW YORK TIMES.   __label__1
{D well, } {D see } that's the reason  we couldn't [ make, +  really make ] them,   __label__39
-- {C and then } with my wife I actually  go to the gym and lift weights, which isn't, I understand, quite exercising,   __label__39
{C so } I've had a chance to kind of take a look at, {F uh, } the pros and cons of both.  __label__39
# Huh.  #  __label__11
just, +  it never crosses my ] mind.  __label__1
# {C And } certainly that's true in # the overall,   __label__40
{D So. } - __label__0
[ I was at, + [ I, + I ] also went to, ] {F uh, } the Porsche   __label__39
-- some people will still buy them,  {D you know, }   __label__1
Was that you, that we didn't hear the whole prompt?  __label__37
{C but, }  {F uh, } - __label__0
You're just -- __label__40
Right   __label__11
She's got all these sisters and her brother to take care of her.   __label__39
Yes.  __label__31
{E I mean } [ it's was, + it's ] just, -  __label__0
I understand, {F uh, } -  __label__39
Okay   __label__11
that part I don't care about.  __label__39
# child #   __label__1
Exactly.  __label__13
What is that?  __label__35
Yeah.   __label__7
and, you know, they're very willing to be taught in many cases now, too,   __label__40
# {D So } [ what do you think about, +   # {F uh, } what do you think about ] what you see on T V about them, like in the news or on the ads,   __label__35
{F Um, } fattening <laughter>.  __label__13
[ {C and, } + {C and } ]  my wife's a school teacher   __label__39
if I can  ((   ))  the other side of the coin for a moment.  __label__8
-- I think so.   __label__40
Uh, uh, just trying to I think be careful, uh, with the way you handle garbage,   __label__40
Wow.  __label__13
Are they driven by themselves.  __label__37
[ It's just, + it's just ] such a change from, {F uh, } Texas because I had grown up with, {F uh, } the heat,  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
<Squeak>. __label__43
I'm twenty-two   __label__39
I think for the family.   __label__39
{C and } I visited other areas,   __label__39
[ in, + in ] at least in criminal law [ some of the, + some of the, ] __label__39
{F Uh, } [ it depends, + {F um, } {D you know, } it depends ] on wh-, - __label__30
I'm a first generation American.  __label__39
I haven't  __label__39
I have never seen catfish, {D you know, } except  [ in fi-, <laughter> + filleted  ] on a plate, I think maybe.   __label__39
{C So, }  {F uh, } I was pretty tied up,   __label__39
Oh.   __label__11
-- some way to work it out,   __label__1
Okay.   __label__18
-- which you are in Dallas, -  __label__1
{C And, }  what they did, they had, {F uh, } a book made up   __label__39
{D Well, } my son had gotten to see a lot of movies this summer, on, choir tour and -- __label__39
for music purposes.   __label__1
# Uh-huh. #  __label__11
{C But, } {F uh, } - __label__0
# I # think that, {F uh, } -  __label__40
Right.  __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
That's right,   __label__7
{C So } the houses actually on our  street [ are a little bit, +  they're kind of gone a little bit ] nicer.  __label__39
kind of put in a certain amount per year,   *[[82 and 84 same utt?]] __label__40
Right.  __label__11
# Yeah,   __label__7
I make a mean spaghetti.  __label__39
[ that's, + that's ] a major chore, {D you know, } [ if you don't, + if you don't ] keep up with it.  __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Say, -  __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
[ I'm, + I'm ] not sure it was gerrymandered,   __label__39
Right.   __label__11
Some of the things, __label__39
Carp is usually pretty much fun.   __label__39
{C but } it's DOW JONES, <noise> which is, {F uh, } the WALL STREET JOURNALS news wire.  __label__39
I think it's just going to be one.  __label__39
It varies from State to State.  __label__1
{C But } they like to, {F uh, } spend time with me.   __label__39
{C And } I'm really pleased with it.  __label__39
[ and, + ] {F uh, } quite a bit.   __label__1
right,   __label__11
# chairmen.  #  __label__1
And {C then, } like I said, they do a lot of # internal, # __label__39
{D now } this one was purebred   __label__39
{F uh,} then usually they, {F uh,}   __label__39
{C Because }  you got to, __label__40
I think, she's [ [ going to, +  going to, ] +  {F uh, } __label__40
-- to tell you the truth.  __label__1
[ {C and, } + {F um, } {C and } ] his children  are very musical,   __label__39
I see.   __label__18
[ I don't have any, + {F um, } <lipsmack> [ I don't, + {D you know, } I don't ] use an ] awful lot of city services.   __label__39
{C And } we got three full sets in  there  and still had room for luggage.  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{C but } my parents really didn't allow us to watch that much T V,   __label__39
{C So, }  to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself without, {D you know, } drawing a lot of looks, means you're really going to do a strenuous workout activity  ((   ))   __label__39
-- we had a lot before Christmas.   __label__1
which is even worse than them just not getting bright <laughter>.  __label__40
{D well, } yes,   __label__0
Yeah,   __label__11
<Ugh> Now [ I don't, + I hardly ever  ] watch T V.   __label__39
# between # us.  __label__1
I g-, -  __label__0
-- {C and } we went up that coastline,   __label__39
I think there's some   things we shouldn't know just for [ nation-, +  national ] security sake.   __label__40
And, {F uh, } pat himself on the back [ for, + for, ]  {F uh, } making a good scoop.  __label__1
That's wonderful.  __label__13
{D Well, } very possibly.   __label__9
{C so } {D you know, } I don't know what he would do.  __label__39
# Right. #  __label__11
# {D Well, } # [ I, + I ] feel the other thing too, {F uh, }   __label__39
{C And } we'd go up to the Adirondacks  and camp   __label__39
{C and } the woman is looking to how easy can she slide in under the steering wheel. __label__40
Bye-bye.  __label__22
# boy, # runs you like twenty something dollars in the store.  __label__1
How long did that movie run?  __label__35
(( Uh-huh )) .  __label__11
# {D You # know }   __label__1
{C And } they, -  __label__0
Yeah.  __label__11
{E I mean, } - __label__0
Although [ I wi-, + ]  I wish, {D you know, } overall they'd try the lottery again.   __label__40
have you had very many of these calls?  __label__37
if my parents were to get ill, I would like to take care of them at home and if I had the money with some help.   __label__39
# {C because, } # {F uh, } - __label__0
Did you cry through it?  __label__37
Yeah.  __label__11
{C But, }  {F uh, } you can get a good seat for, {F uh, } {D well } -  __label__39
Sometimes it just sits around for a while,   __label__39
[ They, +  they ] don't really want them around   __label__39
{C and, }  {F uh, } the children were left unattended in a room, {D you know, }   __label__39
I just haven't had a chance to get back <laughter>.  __label__39
<Noise>. __label__43
{C and } it's not too bad to get it off once it's dried even.   __label__39
I don't have any friends down at  [ the, + the ] Austin plant,   __label__39
{C And, } {D you know, } {D like } hold on here.  __label__8
Exactly,   __label__7
{C But } {E I mean } if you can't do  it with men on base, there's something definitely wrong, {F um, } {D you know, }   __label__40
{E I mean, } [ it's not like, +  it's like. ] - __label__0
-- gets forced into wins like  seventeen games or whatever   __label__1
{C because } once you're best friends with your parents,  then, I think everything go a lot better.  __label__40
Yeah,   __label__11
I wanted to be a P E teacher.  __label__39
<Beep> Okay, {F uh, }   __label__14
that approach.   __label__1
[ [ I, + I, ] + I ] just have not, -  __label__0
I'm not, -  __label__0
{C and } that is mediation training.  __label__39
{C and } I know many of them are doing it.   __label__39
-- for overtime.  __label__1
Have a, - __label__0
-- {C and, } {F uh, } {D well, } [ I, + I ] think what's happened, too, is just our technology is just advancing so rapidly that, and there's so much information available out there that folks out there just have a hard time keeping up, aside from just going through their daily routine of living to get from day to day --  __label__40
No,   __label__29
or maybe the evidence was not  as sensational as the media presented it.   __label__40
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] [ I, + I ] [ s-, + saw ] an episode of the T V show, COPS -- __label__39
That [ will, + will ] be where it is.  {F Uh, } __label__26
{F Uh, } tell you what.  {F Um, } I'll let you start <laughter>.  __label__20
# for # us.   __label__1
{F Uh, }  __label__11
{C And so, } [ we, + we,  ] take it seriously.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I think it gets back to the, {F uh, } parental participation into the program.  __label__40
{C but } -- __label__39
{D Well, } the only problem with these are that they are very expensive.   __label__40
# Uh-huh. #  __label__11
{E I mean, } were they glad?  __label__37
Yes,   __label__7
it did,   __label__39
{D You know, } __label__1
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] I had  a tough time with that   __label__40
{F Oh, } my gosh, {D now } [ that had to be, + that's ] boating.   __label__40
{C And } while he was gone, he had [ looked, + went ] looking for a job and stopped at the store,   __label__39
Right.  __label__11
Uh-huh,   __label__11
Now it's, -  __label__0
I'm in Dallas,   __label__39
Women have come a long way   __label__40
{F Uh, } we're more involved in that now.   __label__40
Uh-huh  __label__11
{C and } that is on a roll out effort right now.   __label__39
{C Or } how about Brian Adams?  __label__34
I talked to my kids about it, {D you know } --  __label__39
{C and } it turns off.  __label__39
Huh-uh.  __label__11
really proud of him though, the way he's, {D you know. } - __label__39
you bet.  __label__13
{C So } right now I know what I'm getting from the state   __label__39
I mostly like classical and jazz.  __label__39
{C and } they're the father of the country and all this.   __label__40
{C And } it was all about women searching for themselves.    *[[two utts?]] __label__39
<Sniffing>. __label__43
it was, what, [ seven thirty, + eight o'clock ] on a week night --  __label__39
# Uh-huh. #  __label__11
{C so, }  {F uh, } mainly what they serve in there is juice and coffee and tea.  __label__39
It's getting harder and harder.   __label__39
by,   *[[should this be part of utt1 and the end of a slash unit?]] __label__0
Yeah.  __label__12
Uh-huh.  __label__11
When I, {F uh, } was in, {F uh, } undergraduate school a long, long time ago, I, {F uh, } noted that the  [ monthly salary, + starting average monthly [ salary  + <<mispronounced>> salary ] ] for engineers [ that, + ] {D you know, } in my discipline, was like <lipsmack> {F oh, } six hundred ten dollars a month or something like that.  __label__39
<Laughter> Yes,  __label__11
of just putting everything on there day after day after day   __label__1
[ {D So, } + {D so } ] I guess our vote is no <laughter>.  __label__38
and workout and then drive back <laughter>.  __label__1
-- {F uh, } she has a charm bracelet with lots of charms on it, a lot of money into it by now --  __label__1
She loves it   __label__39
# be # settled anywhere,  __label__1
# {D You know, } when # it's only {D like } ninety-five.  __label__39
Yes.  __label__7
sounds you, like -  __label__0
{C So } Arlington's going to build a stadium, a bigger one.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and } my Allante has, {F uh } -- __label__39
{C But, } no   __label__10
A cutworm?  __label__37
Those people that try to do everything.  __label__2
I don't think that there is enough being done.   __label__40
{C and } [ I think, + I know  ] California had it for a long time,   __label__39
finally got a little respect.   __label__1
# Yes.   __label__11
like I say, I don't think the guy  who's going to rob a Seven Eleven, is going to rob a Seven  Eleven whether he has a gun or a # knife, baseball bat, # __label__40
-- like that.  __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I don't know how we'd ever find out, {D you know, } really whether it is or  not.  __label__40
-- which, - __label__1
They're pretty good.  __label__39
Yeah,   __label__7
[ I b-, + I belong ] to Quality Paperback Book Club.  __label__39
Okay,  __label__7
-- up there   __label__1
Yeah.  __label__11
fresh tomatoes.  __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
What's that?  __label__19
Um.  __label__11
{C and so } two days a week, I, {F uh, } manage to get home early enough to meet the kids  on the bus <clicking>.   __label__39
No.  __label__29
Right <laughter>.  __label__11
yes,   __label__7
# I'm going to, # __label__22
{F Oh, } my gosh.  __label__13
that's true <laughter>.  __label__7
I've heard stories.  __label__39
{C But, }  {F uh, } yeah,   __label__11
{C and } as a matter of fact there are a lot of programs, {F uh, } such as Peace Corps that promote that.  __label__39
{D Actually, } I'm real close to being in the market to buy a car.  __label__39
they have things for kids to do.   __label__39
Was that the animated version?  __label__37
{F Uh, } {C so } maybe we should start with you <laughter>.   __label__39
I'm like ugh, {D you know, }   __label__39
{C And, } {F uh, } I don't know.  __label__25
{C or } do I?  __label__34
[ in, + ] {F uh, } -  __label__0
<Printer> I think one of the things that's interesting to me is if you look particularly at the political changes -- __label__40
{C But, } it was really good.   __label__39
{C But } she said, I had a mother tell me that she may take a job in San Antonio   __label__39
it's not on that.  __label__39
{C But, } {F uh, } I do not know,   __label__25
<<Very faint>> Yeah.  __label__11
<Laughter>  Yeah.   __label__7
they're about four-feet high.  __label__39
{C so } by that time she  was so well established, {D you know, } __label__39
{C But } -- __label__39
The most expensive.   __label__12
{C And then } I have a green salad that I put around  the outside of that.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D Well, } [ I, + I ] was with  T I until January.   __label__39
-- immediately,   __label__1
-- {F uh, } composer section.  __label__1
You're pretty Texan.  __label__26
{C and } [ I, + I ] thought it was a mistake   __label__39
[ I, + it ] was supposed to be this  June,   __label__39
-- felt like that was a big factor for me.   __label__1
<Laughter> Yeah,   __label__11
That's the one time in the day my husband and I can get away and talk -- __label__39
We went to see AWAKENINGS -- __label__39
{C and, } of course, they tend to cover the county,   __label__39
{C and } she cooks them for an hour with some  (( fat backs )) , <laughter>,  __label__39
{F Um. }  __label__11
It was like they were trying, if you were good,  (( boy )) , let's don't have you on our team, {D you know. }  __label__40
# That, # that would be my main objection.   __label__39
{D See } I know of that too.   __label__39
What kind of -- __label__33
-- [ and so + ] that [ then + ] {D like } local news is really who grew the biggest tomato   __label__1
They don't talk about they're charging that enormous fee every year.  __label__39
{C but, } {D you know, } [ I don't think, +  I think ] it's going to be a long time, if ever, when nice things and really quality construction and  all the other additional amenities <sigh> are really, <sigh> {F uh, } desirable.   __label__40
Does it have to be unanimous?  __label__37
Yes,   __label__7
That there's no problem with getting them to, __label__40
[ I think, + I think ] decorating your food is, {D you know, } really, - __label__40
{C But } they have so much food that [ you, + not matter how hard you try to restrain yourself, you  ] end up eating much more than you need.  __label__39
yeah,   __label__7
{C but } just what little we caught on the news. #  __label__39
Absolutely.   __label__7
It came on after DOCTOR WHO, __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
<Laughter>. __label__43
[ If, + if ] they can say things like, {D you know, } {D well }  he was just, {D you know, } temporarily insane because of, __label__39
-- or animals or anything, {D you know } --  __label__1
<Breathing> what they can do with the rest of the world.  __label__1
That's pretty neat.   __label__39
the nature shows.  __label__1
{C so } I don't think that's right.   __label__40
{D Well, } there is so much about it -- __label__40
And, uh, that can help to cut pollution, I guess some.   __label__40
The book was excellent.  __label__40
is that -  __label__0
Just <talking> because, {D you know, } we didn't really do anything when we went over it seems like. - __label__39
You ever thought about building a house?  __label__37
{C so } it's a brand new book.  __label__39
I think it's so beautiful.  __label__40
No.  __label__29
Yeah,   __label__7
{C so } he said, {F uh, } {D well, } he did comparables that it's about <noise> eighty dollars,   __label__39
It's my feeling also [ [ that, + that, ] + that ] although -  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D Well, } I lived in Omaha for five, __label__30
-- {C and } I use [ a, + one of those ] black poker hoses that actually oozes water every where --  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I know which is worse.  __label__39
{F Uh, } the one that I picked is more similar in format to the newspaper,   __label__39
More than, - __label__0
{C So } I've always had this problem with CONSUMER REPORTS that in the areas that I know a lot about, I disagree with them.  __label__39
{D You know. }   __label__1
[ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] there have been many things that have happened that have not encouraged closeness of families and, {F uh, } support for young people [ that + ] the kind of support that they need, __label__40
that's important -- __label__13
They don't take reservations,   __label__39
The, {F uh, } -  __label__0
Bye-bye.  __label__22
Month to month is, {F uh, } kind of taking into consideration what the bills are and what's  extra   __label__39
I just, -  __label__0
{C and } -- __label__0
{F Uh, } I've never used the DOW JONES news wire   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
it's in the northwest.   __label__39
I usually, {F uh, } -  __label__39
{C or, }  if they wouldn't be able to make ends meet -- __label__40
They are.   __label__7
-- {F um, } when I was probably eighteen,  my senior year in high school --  __label__1
It's  ((   )) -  __label__0
They are just spread out so much,   __label__39
What do you think's going to happen there.   __label__33
{C And } it's just, -  __label__0
[ I, + I've ] kind of lost touch with the company, __label__39
subject of crime in your area?  __label__1
No,   __label__29
We # had three, # __label__39
-- [ they, + they ] were not given the time   __label__1
[  I would, + I would ] think so.  __label__7
On occasion I can wear jeans.   __label__39
but I guess it didn't pan out, huh?  __label__37
{C But } this room, on the other hand, {D you know, } they got rid of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that   __label__39
there was no such thing as watering your lawns -- __label__39
Yeah,   __label__31
Yeah,   __label__7
sure.  __label__39
{C and } I really don't have any {D like } situation comedies that I watch regularly.   __label__39
{F Um, }    *[[slash error]] __label__0
Right.  __label__11
That's true,   __label__7
-- {D so. } - __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
<Laughter> {C But } it's definitely a task.  __label__39
Like  last Saturday we went, had some errands to run   __label__39
{F Uh, } {F um } so long as it's their possession.   __label__16
uh-huh.  __label__11
<Laughter>. __label__43
{F Uh, } what is the, {F uh, } -  __label__35
Yeah,   __label__11
# Yeah. #  __label__11
I think they're all bad, really.   __label__40
<Printer> Right.   __label__7
Which makes her, I guess, unshowable, __label__39
Okay.   __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F Huh. }  __label__11
No   __label__29
No,   __label__10
{F Oh, } I kn-, - __label__0
I must not have understood the whole thing   __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
<Laughter>  # That's what I think. #  __label__7
{D see, } [ I've got a, + on my stereo I've got [ a, +  a, ] ] {F uh, } turntable, and then I've got a dual cassette   __label__39
Whatever you like, {F huh? }  __label__16
Uh-huh.   __label__7
Right,   __label__11
Huh-uh.  __label__11
It's, - __label__0
{F Um, } how about you?  __label__33
Yeah   __label__11
rather than one.  __label__1
-- {D you know, } if it's, - __label__1
Okay <breathing>.  __label__22
Okay,   __label__18
{C and, } __label__14
I know many people are [ co-, + very comfortable ] in the classroom and what have you wearing pants.  __label__39
# Yeah. #  __label__11
Ford.    __label__42
{C and then } I'd like to teach, maybe mathematics or something.   __label__39
{C And, } {F uh, } -  __label__0
Huh-uh.  __label__7
I didn't like that much.  __label__39
{C and } it's really discouraging to be in a phone bank and call people and not, -  __label__40
{C And } that thing had the darndest combination of metric and Wentworth  and, {F uh, } S A E.   __label__39
-- those were just kind of good old cartoons.  __label__1
# our # taxes are paying to feed and shelter those people.  __label__39
Are you surviving.   __label__37
{C but } you'd be surprised also how, much people watch you that even not, {F uh, } participating in any type crime.   __label__40
{C So, } - __label__0
Yeah,   __label__1
<Breathing> {F Uh, } not so much that,  I, {F uh, } more likely to see those at a ski show or something,   __label__28
Yeah,   __label__11
{F Oh, } yeah,   __label__7
We do a few things,   __label__39
# {D you # know, } {C because } the farmers would buy the straw if it's a, {D you know, } similar price.  __label__39
[ I, +  I'm ] afraid I don't have  the statistics in front of me.  __label__39
{D Well } I might have liked some of that   __label__39
# through {D like } a # com-, - __label__1
[ To-, +  totally ] vested.  __label__1
# {C And } # she finally learned that  you just can not do this, {D you know. }   *[[can not -> cannot]] __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
I can just see how much, __label__39
-- because I'm [ a, + still [ a, + a ] ] college student.  {F Um. }  __label__1
{D like, } if I look out my window right now, I can see, {D you know, } couple of pine trees, some oak trees --  __label__39
their baby <baby> when they want to go out to dinner or to movies or  whatever, __label__1
[ that + that ] it was worth it to save  and to not have, {F uh, } something and, {F uh, } in return know that something better was going  to be at the end of it   __label__1
I was in the band,   __label__26
we'd like too much and eat too much <laughter>.  __label__1
Yeah.   __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C But } of course, here we wear a light  weight jacket a lot # {D you know, } {D you know, # }  __label__39
Yes.   __label__11
# Thatcher,   __label__39
Uh-huh.   __label__11
{C And } she's so ugly.  __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
{D You know, } right,   __label__11
Are they things you already owned   or you pick them up  just to do that refinishing?  __label__37
{C Because } [ every, + every ] month all of these credit cards report to the credit bureau, {D you know. }  Automatically, [ mo-, + most ] of them do.  __label__39
{F Huh. }  __label__11
For how many years?  __label__35
{C but, } {F uh, } it's not like they're going to disappear all of a sudden.   {F Uh, } even if you do do a total ban on them.   __label__40
uh-huh.  __label__11
Right,   __label__4
{F Uh, } I get most of my news {F uh, } from newspapers really.   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__7
Is that the one set in the fifties, or sixties.  __label__38
Right.  __label__7
Wow.  <<pause>>   __label__13
# Home repair. #  __label__39
-- # {D well } [ Jim # has, + Jim has ] a budget.   __label__39
Okay.  __label__0
# {C and } # I think [ he, + he ] missed a lot of, {F um, } our up bringing.  __label__39
Lynn, [ do you, + do you ] want to start?  __label__37
[ I would, +   I would ] spend all my time in London, __label__39
{D you know, } you think, oh my goodness --  __label__1
{C So, } despite the fact that I should  be tying flies or fly fishing [ or, +  or ] going for walks in the mountains, __label__39
{D Well, } she just sent me the information out.   __label__27
Right.  __label__11
<Laughter>  Yeah,   __label__7
it was absolutely horrible.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
though I would never even consider __label__39
<Laughter>  He put new wiring in,   __label__39
-- [ you should, + you should ] be sharing your family. __label__1
# Where are you from? #  __label__35
{C and, } people's response to that, {D you know, } at first not trusting and now, expecting more.  __label__40
{C and, } {F uh. } - __label__0
Actually I saw it twice because I <laughter> liked it so much.  __label__39
Pennsylvania.  __label__39
I thought it was okay.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C And } I thought, my God talk about tieing up things [ for, + for, ] -   *[[typo -> tying]] __label__39
I think I've been trout fishing once.   __label__39
It drives me crazy <laughter>.  __label__39
[ I + ] was watching it, the, first time I ever saw a microbiologist on there I thought {D well, } it just goes to prove it has nothing to do with your physical capabilities. __label__39
Uh-huh.   __label__11
here you, -  __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F Oh, } {D well, } {D see } I don't really. -  __label__0
{C and } if I wanted to read, I wanted to read something light and relaxing [ and -- + __label__39
{C And, } {F um, } we  ((   )) . - __label__0
{C and } she's about  ten pounds,   __label__39
{C but } then when, once it finally affects you  [ then, + then ] it really starts to bother you.  __label__40
I was in Peru,   __label__39
Always have been,  __label__39
No   __label__29
# <Laughter> # I have trouble buying a twenty thousand  dollar car still,   __label__39
{C and } my kids wanted to learn how to play it   __label__39
{F Uh, } {C and } they have become, [ or, + ] also [ a, + a  ] real bother sometimes.  __label__39
I think that's unbelievable.  __label__40
{D Well, } that's good.  __label__13
{F Oh, } gosh,   __label__13
{F Uh, } I haven't, -  __label__0
She disappeared from her [ hu-, + {F uh, } husband  ] who was abusing her.  __label__39
Yes,   __label__7
{C and } that's all tax money.   __label__40
-- is helping others <<pause>> <noise>.  __label__1
when it was just me, it was an easy decision.  __label__1
{C And so, }  basically no one was taking the responsibility --  __label__40
{F Um, }  (( if ))  I can find it.   __label__1
And found that, {F uh, } more creative avenues were the right answer for us.  __label__1
yeah.  __label__11
teaches at a preschool.  __label__1
that's the guy who hired me,   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
That's interesting.  __label__13
[ I have children [ in, + in, ] + [ s-, + ] I have three children ] in school right now,   __label__39
We, {F um, } lived in Kansas City for a couple of years,   __label__39
No,   __label__7
Oh.  __label__11
But then people started dumping trash. __label__1
Twenty-three de-, - __label__0
Most people don't realize it.   __label__40
Yes <laughter>.  __label__31
We like those things that way.  __label__40
It doesn't matter where you go or anything.   __label__39
[ We, + we ]  go hunting every once in a while   __label__39
Pay attention to what's happening.   Talk to the teachers.   {F Uh, } talk  to their kids about school.  And support the institution   __label__39
It was, it was the funniest thing,   __label__39
-- she doesn't want to be left.  {F Um. }  __label__1
Yeah.  __label__11
<Laughter>. __label__43
My mother-in-law -  __label__39
are looking at those, {F uh, } bills that come in, and those statements,  __label__1
{C And } they said,  sure that's no problem, but, {D you know, } why don't we consolidate your bills,   __label__39
{D See } I can remember paying seventy-five  cents for a pattern <laughter>.  __label__39
at least your trying something.  __label__13
Um.  __label__11
{C And, } {D you know, } {C and then } to go into Baltimore, {E I mean, } [ it + {D well, } it's ] fewer miles,   __label__39
Uh-huh,   __label__11
of  everything  that I did, I guess I enjoyed probably wallpapering the most   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{E I mean, } I'd not a -- - __label__0
yeah.   __label__31
Yeah,   __label__22
Gorbachev said you can't do it,   __label__5
{C because } [ they, + they  ] know that you're biased.  __label__40
Hack it all over the place?   __label__16
Does he bring a little one home with him   __label__37
{C But } there's a lot of them out there that haven't.  __label__39
-- because, {F uh, } I get married in a couple of weeks   __label__1
# That's right.  #  __label__7
Right.  __label__11
it looks, {F uh, } halfway decent   __label__39
[ Are you, + are you ] married?   __label__37
yeah.   __label__7
{C and } there's no real way of finding out.  __label__40
-- I'm thinking White Narcissus or something -- __label__39
Yes,   __label__11
{D well } [ I, + I ] don't know whether it's age or what it is.   __label__40
{C But, } I've got a ways to go yet.   __label__39
{C because } they look back   __label__39
{C and then } they discontinued.   __label__39
that's what keeps, -  __label__40
<Noise> {F Oh, } Dursban Two,  __label__18
Leave?  __label__37
I figured for the main thing it's going to be sandwiches.  __label__1
{C and, } {F uh, } - __label__0
it could not possibly have gone <child_talking> any lower   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
Really.  __label__13
{C but } they say that we have wonderful schools.  __label__39
{C So, } we're in the process of, {F uh, } revitalizing  the whole situation.   __label__39
I don't know,   __label__25
I know.   __label__7
Yeah.  __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
# <Laughter>.  # __label__43
-- they're always getting something in the mail   __label__39
{C But, }  {F uh, } - __label__0
{C and then } it stops,  __label__39
{C So, } you have no children at all.  __label__16
I thought so.   __label__39
{C And, } ] yeah,   __label__1
{D You know, } you might do the same thing.  __label__40
<Noise> <<it sounds as if speaker B is washing dishes>>.  {D Well } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] can spot a kid [ who really, + {D you know, } whose parents ] spend every, __label__39
-- make a ] meal, {D you know. }  __label__1
Yes <laughter>.  __label__31
# Yeah.  #  __label__11
-- how they, + and do  they ] differ from {D like } mine.  __label__1
# [ d-, + # drugs ] and, __label__1
<Laughter>. __label__43
{C and then } you get some real sharp cheddar cheese -- __label__8
I did not need that money.   __label__39
Plano's doing real good on that.   __label__39
I feel that, {F uh, } we've missed as far as the top jobs go. __label__40
{D Well } Randy, we've just about used up our time here,  __label__39
{F Oh, } [ there's, + there's ] some nice things in Baltimore, {D you know, }   __label__39
-- nice nylons ] and dresses.  __label__1
{C And } {F uh, } one of the guys  that was on the jury they were asking him [ if, +  if ] you could believe a lawyer or if a, __label__39
{E I mean } [ you, + you ] have everything given to you.   __label__40
{C and } they're not contributing taxes.  __label__39
{C but, } {D you know, } that's, -  __label__0
{C and } [ I, +   I ] think we may not have ever have seen that without some of these, {F uh, } newspeople  being in there in the broadcasts  and [ the, +  the, ] {F uh, } soldiers leaving, {F um, }  {D you know, } surrendering and, __label__40
Which is made by Toyota.  __label__1
Here we go.  __label__39
{C and } I said, {D well } let's start this letter,   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F um, } [ I, + {D yeah, } I ] didn't even tell the apartment manager, __label__39
# there's # a, -  __label__0
{F Oh, } is that right?  __label__17
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F Oh, } yeah.  __label__11
{C and } it's good for us, __label__40
Yeah.  __label__11
{C but } it was ar-, -  __label__0
[ I, + {C and, } {D well, } sometimes when [ I, + I ] ] take my kids to the playground that's the only other exercise [ I, + I ] really think I do.   __label__39
I go now, with my husband.   __label__39
Uh-huh,   __label__11
Yeah.   __label__11
<breathing> __label__43
[ Another thing that I have, + another problem I have ]  is, {F uh, } I don't really know how to resolve this,   __label__39
{C and } I think [ there's a, + there's a ] real challenge there.   __label__39
I'm like, {F uh, } no, no, no.  __label__39
[ [ I, + I, ] + I ] mixed it, made the call,   __label__39
that's what, -  __label__0
# {C And } [ I, + # {D you know, } I  ] didn't, -  __label__0
# Yeah,   __label__7
yeah.   __label__31
[ [ I, +  {F uh, } I, ] + I ] like the way it is.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__31
[ not, + not ] even the news   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
I think this next year, [ I'm going to, + I'm going to  ] attempt to play more   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I'll try the middle of the afternoon.  __label__5
I've had to use the air conditioner in March,  __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
with the top down.   __label__1
Huh,   __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
Right.  __label__11
It's {D like } hundred bucks [ a, + a ] month or something -- __label__39
{C and } them, -  __label__0
that's right.   __label__39
-- real quick <laughter>.  __label__1
{C and } they shouldn't be,   __label__40
Even if I'm, {F uh, } doing something like an afghan, if I'm close to the end, sometimes I'll <laughter>, do the same thing.  __label__39
{C and, } {F uh, } he was just skin and bones, {D you know, }   __label__39
And then from the parents side, have the parents support the school.  Get involved.   __label__1
{C or, } how do you work your budgeting?  __label__34
that's about, -  __label__0
-- <Talking> I'd rather have some restrictions put on weapons but yet allow hunting rifles, {F uh, } things that people would use for sporting type of, {F uh, } a, activity.   __label__1
-- {C and } my sister had gotten through  college,   __label__39
I actually hadn't heard anything about it,   __label__39
{C But, }  {F uh, } [ as, + as ] far as that goes, [ I, + we ] at least agree on what we enjoy.  __label__39
[ [ I've, + I've,  ] + I  ] miss it, because I really find it a very relaxing hobby too.  __label__39
isn't it amazing.  __label__13
{C but, } {F uh } -- __label__40
Yeah,   __label__31
{C but } they're fast as lightning  and all that crap.   __label__39
I think maybe they'd need to be  more knowledgeable though than just your average Joe off the street -- __label__40
{C and } I'm changing [ [ [ the, + {D like } the towel racks and stuff, ] + the, ] + the ] fixtures out to make them wood,   __label__39
Right,   __label__7
# {E I mean, } #   *[[need a slash]] __label__0
<Laughter> I know,   __label__7
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C And } if you want to see them, you might just as well enjoy football.  __label__40
{C but } that's <laughter>, - __label__0
{C So, } - __label__0
years.  __label__1
{D you know, } you'd  pull ] them out of there so fast.  __label__1
-- for us.  __label__1
don't know.   __label__1
I, {D you know, } -  __label__0
-- the ] gym, because that's very stressful to me,   __label__1
they say they're going to lower,   __label__39
{D Well, } that's good,   __label__13
{C but } it's basically a nursing home too,   __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
{F Oh, } I think I do,   __label__25
{F Uh, } they're all grown up.  __label__27
Even before that,   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__7
We make, {F uh, } cause we're my wife is Syrian.   __label__39
{C but } three and a half weeks ago, we had an ice storm <laughter>.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yeah, {F oh, }   __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F Oh } yeah,   __label__11
Right.  __label__26
No,   __label__29
Gorbachev has made his attempt   __label__40
that's true.  __label__40
accessories,   __label__11
Exempt.  __label__39
-- {D you know. }   __label__1
I don't think it's as bad as L A either.  __label__40
Yeah.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yeah,  __label__11
{C and } they truly can't read --   __label__40
Yeah,   __label__7
One place I think I didn't take her.  __label__39
uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and } [ it's, + it's ] really, -  __label__0
{C and, } {F uh, } it's just remarkable how close it will match the paint, {F uh, }   __label__39
We went through {D like } twenty-two hundred dollars worth of vet bills.  __label__39
Sure.  __label__7
No,   __label__29
Do you have any pets?  __label__37
[ if, + if ] somebody does observe you [ at, + {D say } at ] a party, {F uh, } using drugs -- __label__40
# [ I don't, + # I don't ] either.  {F Uh, } to make it  totally honest.   __label__39
# because # it was such a big deal.   __label__1
that over there, {F um, } -  __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
(( through ))  Papa Doc,   __label__1
Really.   __label__26
U N L V,   __label__12
{D you know, } I haven't, -  __label__0
Right.  __label__11
maybe -- __label__39
it's been on cable,   __label__39
{C So, } has it been getting worse that you noticed, or -- __label__37
[ It's, + that was ] one of the first  things I made for my husband, because I was {D like, } {F um, } -  __label__39
[ She's, + she's ] little <laughter>.  __label__39
{C but } he wasn't there yet.  __label__39
You'd like it very much.  __label__40
Now, you open the hood and it's scary.  __label__40
The only thing about the death  penalty [ [ and, + and ] + ] I know [ that, + that ] they try to be careful   __label__40
[ that is, + {D well } that's ]  destroying the ozone, isn't it?  __label__37
[ How is your + what is your ] feeling about {F uh } {F uh } expressing yourself by burning the American flag?  __label__33
{C So, }  {F uh, } - __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Right,   __label__11
{D Well, } that will be interesting.  __label__13
{F Uh, } Nacogdoches.  __label__39
A lot of the northern states and a lot of the Eastern states have bottles.   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
I definitely agree.   __label__7
{F Uh, } they had out of town newspapers   __label__39
{F Uh. }  __label__0
Yeah.   __label__0
I don't think  so.  __label__39
{C but } sometimes it's just, {F uh, } -  __label__39
-- # preschool and children's # day out --  __label__1
Yeah,   __label__11
[ what's, + what's ] the lady's name?  __label__35
{F Uh, } {D well } actually not.   __label__28
{C but } they usually run about sixty to sixty-five.   __label__39
{C and } now all of a sudden they're going home   __label__39
{F Oh, } okay.  __label__18
yeah.   __label__7
{C and } they got  tickets for the opening night.  __label__39
[ That's, + {F um, } that's ] a little steeper.   __label__39
{C and } ... - __label__0
Great <laughter>.  __label__13
which do I like better,   __label__32
Right.  __label__11
It's just primarily the price that's, {F uh, } satisfying at this point. #   __label__39
{C and } he hits a home run   __label__39
# Uh-huh. #  __label__11
it is my favorite.   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
it's going to look like, -  __label__40
{D So, } {C so } it's good.  __label__40
# [ Everybody, + everybody ]  is.  #  __label__40
-- forever it seems like,   __label__1
That's true.  __label__13
-- I had ] a sixty-six Mustang I was rebuilding.   __label__1
<Laughter>. __label__43
Yeah,   __label__11
{C But, }  {F uh, } __label__40
Uh-huh,  {F uh. }  __label__11
{F Uh, } {C and } yet -- __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__31
Yeah,   __label__11
{F Uh, } I think it was a romantic novel by Danielle Steel or one of those.  __label__39
Right.  __label__11
no   __label__10
{C and } they say that, {F uh, } juries are extremely  vulnerable to, {F uh, } sort of emotional pitches, {D you know, }   __label__39
[ I, +  I ] don't know that I ever learned to drive it or  anything,   __label__39
{C because } [ I, + I  ] prefer to be waited on too.   __label__39
{D Well, } [ uh-, + ] my wife and I and we've got a thirteen week old baby   __label__39
Where's that?  __label__35
I think they get a lot of people in trouble.  __label__40
Okay,   __label__14
I don't,   __label__39
[  We, + we ] buy from intimate international banking.   __label__40
{F Oh, } that's good. __label__13
[ that, + ] I don't have any trouble with it.   __label__39
<Laughter> That's like, -  __label__0
<Smack>  {C So } I don't know what they are going to do.  __label__39
{C and } the older brother is <laughter> {D you know, } running around all over the place   __label__39
Okay.   __label__22
-- {F uh, } <laughter> {C and } it was really funny,   __label__39
yeah.  __label__0
<Laughter>. __label__43
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Big solid pieces of oak are just -- __label__40
{D So } what are your opinions on it?  __label__35
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Especially when you are dealing with [ a, + a ] subject like, {F uh, } capital punishment or something or -- __label__40
{F Um, } uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and } the second was this phone call from Buddy Ryan, I got fired can you believe that <laughter>.  __label__39
it was so fattening.  __label__39
{C or, } - __label__0
{C but } whether it's something that they can put [ to, + to ]  economic use later on is a different subject.  __label__40
{D Gee, } like starting over, # I guess. #  __label__13
Huh-uh,   __label__11
I can't think of anything else to say about painting.  __label__39
Right.   __label__11
{C And then } my other girlfriend just, {D you know, } tears her hair out and goes at it, {D you know, } twenty-four hours a day, watching both kids all the time.   __label__39
{C but } like  I said I just have that one family,   __label__39
# {C But, } # - __label__0
-- and from that extract the numbers that have appeared the most --  __label__1
{F um, } [ we're, + we're  ] just getting into the fajitas and all that stuff that you could, -  __label__1
{C and } he's two now,   __label__39
# Just recently. #  __label__38
Okay.   __label__7
Yeah,   __label__11
my husband's family had [ a, + a ] motor boat, {F uh, }  when we got engaged   __label__39
{F Uh, } yeah,   __label__31
I think that the people that [ are, + ] have, {F um, } a lower income, which you automatically equate with lower education -- __label__40
{C And } we pulled up almost half of our yard just by raking it,   __label__39
{F Oh, } they're wonderful.  __label__7
right   __label__26
{C So } you just flip through there until you find a <smack> eighty, eighty-eight computer <breathing>   __label__39
{F Oh, } yeah.  __label__11
[ {C and then, } + {F uh, } then ] there's the ones that you never know anything about,   __label__39
comes,   __label__7
{C and } he was so funny.   __label__39
[ the, + they're ] voice activated   __label__39
{C and } you could  shop until {D like } twelve or one o'clock that night   __label__39
{F uh, } get that through to the people and get us educated.  __label__1
We had, {F uh, } Pine Knob -- __label__39
{C But, } which [ that + ] doesn't make any sense to me either.   __label__39
{C And } you know the funny thing is, now that I have a large kitchen with a big island and that, I still have people trying to come, {D you know, }   __label__39
{C but, }  it's getting more and more like that where there's more and more couples   __label__40
It is.   __label__16
{F Ooh, }  {D well } I don't know.   __label__30
that's nice.   __label__13
In fact, {F uh, } {D you know, } we're used to running around in, {D you know, } spring clothes in December,   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
That is excellent.   __label__39
{D Well, } I don't have solutions to the problems,   __label__39
# Yeah.   __label__7
<Child_yelling>. __label__43
Certainly.   __label__7
Uh-huh.  __label__11
[ That's the, + that's probably the ] major question.  __label__40
Yeah.  __label__11
{D you know, } jeans just flat out weren't allowed, __label__1
you have the ruling class   __label__40
[ {C Or, } + {D you know, } {C or } ] a car accident.  __label__39
[ did I, + didn't we ] push?  __label__37
[ you ei-, + you either ] pay the thing off   __label__39
{C or, } - __label__37
you would think they would. #  __label__40
{D Well, } I guess <laughter>.  __label__15
# It's a # -- __label__37
I've lived in, <noise> {F uh, } {F uh, } -  __label__1
is it up to the, -  __label__0
How about you,   __label__33
If it was a customer presentation  then that would be different.  __label__39
I used to watch  DALLAS, years ago.   __label__39
{C and } -- __label__39
that restaurant's changed,   __label__5
{C And then } [ I was, +  {F um, }   I decided, ] {D well, } I like this author,   __label__39
no one wants to be at downtown Dallas much.  __label__40
[ I, + I ] like Buicks.   __label__39
clothes that are in between where you're not down to regular size yet -- __label__1
{D You know, }  I, -  __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F Oh, } yeah,   __label__11
{D Well, } we have to keep talking, I guess <laughter>.  __label__40
Either that or they're just so understaffed that they can't afford -- __label__40
Did you.  __label__17
Uh-huh.  __label__11
# Uh-huh.  #  __label__11
I'm trying to think back now,   __label__4
Okay.  __label__18
Arkansas.  __label__12
{C and } the better the memorizer you are the better your grades are going to be.  __label__39
At seven,   __label__7
Excus-, {F uh, } -  __label__1
[ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {C and, } ] {F uh, } - __label__0
yeah,   __label__0
{F Uh, } it seems like an unusual subject this time of the year   __label__40
{C And } [ we, + ] [ the, + the ]  principal feature I like about ours is that it's pier and beam.  __label__39
I think then that a life sentence to restitution is appropriate.  __label__40
It's, {F uh, }  (( Tigon ))   __label__39
-- without, {D you know, } really tearing up their place.   __label__1
Yeah.  __label__11
<Laughter>. __label__43
{D you know, } I am sort of [ [ a, + a, ] + an ] advocate [ [ [ of, + of, ] + {F uh, } of  letting people, ] + of having ] free speech   __label__39
{C and, } {F um, } <lipsmack> up there there was [ no, + no ] place that we went tasted like real Mexican food to me.  __label__39
-- hibiscus ] plants no longer exist <laughter>.   __label__1
It's just going to take, {F uh, } {F uh, } really, {F uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, }  a combination effort, {A I think, } of the majority of the American people to come to a decisive answer, __label__40
Right,   __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Right,   __label__11
-- {C and } could call them,   __label__39
{C and } [ I, + he ] said the most you'd ever have to pay is fifty dollars for them to cancel, {D you know, } whatever payments you had,   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__12
Oh.  __label__11
It was real good talking to you.  __label__22
In other words you own your own home.  __label__38
-- [ reading, and, + {F uh, } reading and ]  playing nice with others, and that sort of thing.  __label__1
I say {D well, } I need a checkup in six months,   __label__39
{C but, } - __label__0
{C but } # if somebody can make  a regulation about it, they will.  __label__40
Yeah.  __label__11
I guess it's kind of the sadist in everyone <laughter>.   __label__40
{C and } I do fabric painting.  __label__39
-- BLAZING SADDLES.  __label__26
{D you know, } they've got it made,  __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Is that not good?  __label__37
Of course it took eighteen months for  [ the thing, + the trial ] to happen.  __label__39
of course, you wouldn't think Pillsbury would put out certain chemicals,  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D well, } {F uh, } some of the books I've read lately have to do with crafty type things [ where I've, + where I've, ] {F um, } learned things that I'm going to do for my children for Christmas --  __label__39
{C And } on top of that spending a good portion of my earlier years in the military, as a Green Beret, I definitely respect the power of weaponry.  __label__39
I never have either.  __label__39
yeah.   __label__11
That's right.  __label__7
We will do it.  __label__39
Yep.  __label__7
you can't [ just, + just ] hope for abstinence.  __label__40
That's true.  __label__7
{C so, } __label__39
{C And } he came [ with, + with ] his own raf-, -  __label__39
{F uh, } some of them didn't   __label__39
Yes,   __label__11
apparently they've been so [ in, + ] {D well } I don't know inbred, or what,   __label__39
{D Well, } have you seen a new movie lately?  __label__37
Doing it <talking>. - __label__13
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I don't know [ if you've, +  {D well, } if you've ] driven a pick up truck, {D you know, }   __label__40
<Throat_clearing>. __label__43
-- in the ice, everything, because here, {D you know, } not as severe as the snow is in Pennsylvania,   __label__1
[ somewhat, + sometimes, ]   __label__1
((   ))  I pressed the button one,   __label__39
# Yeah,   __label__7
[ Y-, + yeah, ]   __label__31
<Smack>  {D So, } - __label__0
course it, it has all of those qualities   __label__39
Right.  __label__11
{D Well, } we have a funny commercial around here.   __label__39
{C So. }    {D Well, } I guess it worked out.   __label__39
{F Oh, } gosh, ((   ))  all the other, -  __label__0
{F Uh, } {D you know, } [ it, + it ] just seemed to lack any sort of debate.  __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
# {C and } # all, - __label__0
{C and } I would be burning up, like in the summer time --  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D Now } these aren't huge lakes from your point of view --  __label__40
-- kind of thing.  __label__1
# continue # our family   __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
The one that looks like Monopoly apartments.  __label__39
{D Well, }  __label__0
-- and knock and <laughter>, - __label__1
# Yeah. #  __label__1
Radial arm saw is, I guess, what they're called.  __label__40
Okay,   __label__18
What all things do you plant in it,   __label__35
# Unfortunately, #   __label__39
{F Oh, } okay.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
if I was looking for outside care I probably would stay away from professional  child care centers and try to find, if I was close to home, relatives or people with  [ it is + ] same values and possibly religious faith or something similar so that she would be raised  in an environment that would be similar to what we would have in our own homes [ as, + as ] parents.  __label__39
Where did you go?  __label__35
No.   __label__7
Ju-, - __label__1
the people are, -  __label__40
all the tourists come there.  __label__39
{C and } that's why, {D you know, } I'm like,  {D okay, }  what's my role in this thing, <laughter>, {D you know, } __label__32
Were you looking into becoming a reporter   __label__37
-- {D you know, }   __label__1
Uh-huh,   __label__7
that's true,  __label__7
{C And } I do.  __label__39
It, - __label__0
Yeah.  __label__11
{F Uh. } __label__11
He knew it.   __label__40
Have you seen the movie, {F um, } CROSSING DELANCY?  __label__37
{C and } in fact they were ] so well dug in that, {F uh, } when we sent our tanks around behind them they couldn't get turned around in time.  __label__1
we got a sales tax.   __label__39
# Yeah. #  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Okay,   __label__14
{C And } they provide one meal a day.  __label__39
Two dogs,   __label__12
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F Uh, } {C and } [ [ [ we budget, + we're, ] + our, ] + our new thing to our budget is ] we just had a baby.   __label__39
{C so } [ I, + I ] wish I could tell you   __label__4
it's kind of a tip.  __label__1
I can't believe this   __label__39
I see   __label__11
[ It's really, + they had, __label__39
{D actually } we were  supposed to get married when I got out of college.   __label__39
they go out a lot?  __label__38
you're probably right.  __label__40
{D Well } did you ever see, {F um, } FLATLINERS.  __label__37
<Laughter> I do the same thing.   __label__7
{C and } I have some, -  __label__39
It really is. -  __label__0
you will not pay your bill at the end of the month, __label__1
{C And, } {F uh, } as a society <laughter>  we are paying a staggering price for this.  __label__40
{F um, } [ he's, + he's ] governor of New York   __label__39
# That's # one of the things that we do.   __label__39
We had it built, actually.  __label__39
{F Huh. }   __label__0
# Right. #  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__11
{C but } I would think it would be easier to detect those  things because you could detect them down [ strean-, +  {E or } stream ] or such,  __label__40
They had started out with that,   __label__39
-- [ I'm, + [ s-, + ] I'm ] in Dallas, but  only technically <laughter>.  __label__39
{D well, } it makes you understand that, {D you know, } things are different <laughter>.  __label__39
I got one from Payless Cashways,   __label__39
I was watching some show the other day,   __label__39
{F Oh } really.  __label__11
<Laughter>. __label__43
-- # thing,   __label__1
I don't like to run myself.   __label__39
-- they just, {D you know, } start going through the phone book or going through a series of numbers,   __label__39
[  I'm a, + I'm  a ]  technician   __label__39
how about you?  __label__33
Oh.  __label__11
hi,   __label__23
[ an-, + {C and } ] she pursued her education along the lines that I did -- __label__39
{C And then } you think, {E I mean, } [ I ha-, +  {E I mean, } I can remember, I have ] not been out of school that long,   __label__39
# {F Huh. # }  __label__11
<throat_clearing>, the majority are co-operative day-cares.   __label__39
# okay.   __label__18
Uh-huh.  __label__11
<Throat_clearing> It's strong enough for any job  where you don't try to take more than say three-eighths of an inch at a time.   __label__39
It would have to do with poverty.  __label__40
{C and } [ we, + we ] sort of just rotated around the dial each night a different one.   __label__39
She  ((   ))  took it with her,    *[[sd]] __label__1
{D so, } you do recycle, don't you?  __label__37
{C And } they say it's going to last  about two to three weeks.   __label__39
boy, {F oh, } boy.   __label__13
{D Well } that sounds real neat.   __label__13
{F Uh, } no   __label__29
{C but } now when I look back at it, it must have been a really difficult <laughter>  thing that she did -- __label__39
they're not coming out ahead at all.   __label__39
{D Well } when you get out into the real world  then you'll know.  __label__40
[ [ [ you, + you  kind of, ] + you don-, ] + you really don't ] know what to do.   __label__40
Oh,   __label__11
it's interesting that [ we're, + we're ] recycling computer type paper.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
# Yeah.  #  __label__11
nope,   __label__29
Upstate.  __label__39
# by, ] {F uh } # , voting laws, {F uh, } [ from reg-, +  from their eligibility to register. ]   __label__1
-- rules that it would take to administer it   __label__1
{D Well, } anytime that we stop and think it can't hurt.  __label__40
{C So } I think some [ place, + {D you know, } places ] like that, it should be {D like } mandatory -- __label__40
{C And } [ I'm, + I'm ] sure they're a lot more organized too, because they've done it before.  __label__40
fascinating.   __label__1
<Laughter>.   *[[slash error]] __label__14
# Yeah. #  __label__11
{C But, } {D you know, } {F um, } I see a recipe and think, {F oh } {D wow, } I'd really like to try this, cause I'm single   __label__39
-- it's never too late.  __label__1
We were using baby food   __label__39
all I can think of is if you don't keep [ a real, + a real ] tight budget, how do you control expenses,   __label__32
-- what all.  __label__1
Huh-uh.  __label__11
{C and } [ it's -- + __label__40
-- and then you open up the oven door and leave it in for another <laughter> forty-five minutes -- __label__1
Cayenne?  __label__37
{C So } it's not, {F uh, } -  __label__0
{C and } they said in  general, generals are more familiar with training, that they believe in training more.  __label__39
Yes,   __label__11
{F Oh, } that's great.  __label__13
boy if I go, in the summer time I try to [ jog, + jog ] a couple of miles --  __label__39
I know, that's really neat.   __label__40
Thanks.  __label__22
It sounds like her life is full too.  __label__40
{F Uh, } there used to be, __label__39
-- middle income person, {D you know. }   __label__1
{C and } I am finding out, a lot of the spare time that I had isn't there.  __label__39
{C But } {E I mean, } [ [ w-, + what's, ] + what's ] happened here [ [ is, + is, ] + is ] -  __label__0
I don't go to movies that often,   __label__39
They don't take them,   __label__1
we-, ] +  older. ]   __label__1
uh-huh.  __label__11
{C And, } {F uh, } it seems that [ [ business wise, + {F uh, } in the business community, ] + {E or } your employers ] seem to be taking more and   more time away from the family.   __label__40
{C And } I'll [ be, + ] have much more energy when I'm done than when I started,   __label__39
[ It's a, +  {D like } it's ] something you  either just really want to do it   __label__40
it is for drugs, {D you know, } because you really can't on the street make any money off of it per se, {D you know, }   __label__40
no.  __label__29
Uh-huh.  __label__11
The oldest one he's -- __label__39
{C and } if we had something to do before they get to be full-blown adult criminals,   __label__40
Yeah,   __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C And } that's what was kind of [ what, + where ] we were, {D you know, }   __label__39
they're [ always, + always ] happy.   __label__40
# I know   __label__7
{F Um, }  [ how-, + however,  ] I was, - __label__0
bye, bye.  __label__22
Harrison Ford and, how does the story line go?  __label__35
{C and } we, -  __label__0
{D You know, }   __label__0
[ [ It's, +  it's, ] +   {F uh, } it's ] really a sin,   __label__40
we're not I don't think.   __label__40
{C and so, } basically, I'd already peed off ((in)) that morning   __label__39
All right,   __label__7
{E I mean, } that's why they recycle.   __label__39
{F Oh, } Chris Xeros.  __label__16
Oh <laughter>.  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__31
Yeah.  __label__11
I'm just so excited about that.   __label__39
-- [ to the, + to the ] main budget proposals   __label__1
{D Well, } because we finally negotiated that I was losing my mind,  {F uh, } he sleeps in the laundry room   __label__27
{D Well, } __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
I take, my paper,   __label__39
{C And } everybody in my family has always had, -  __label__39
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ]  {F uh, } {C then } they have wine casks all over the place so you're lined up waiting in line to  this place   __label__39
{C And, } - __label__0
{F Uh. }  __label__0
the world does not revolve around West Virginia -- __label__40
And I thought, gosh,   __label__39
Virginia, I imagine, gets real humid, doesn't it?  __label__37
destroys my car,  __label__1
{F Oh } [ that, + that ] you mean about the, __label__16
# {C and } # what I make isn't taxed very  highly because I'm still in school.  __label__39
{C And } every year we learn one more thing that we didn't know before.  Like about these <laughter> mums.  __label__39
# {F uh, } # {F oh, } timing belts and things like that.   __label__1
{F Uh, }  we had a school that had classes probably about the same size you're talking, twenty-seven, thirty kids [ to sc-, + to a # class. # ]  __label__39
Because when time came for him to go back to graduate school, we were [ in, +  in ]  fairly good shape financially as far as not having any major debts.   __label__39
[ In, + in ] Oklahoma.  __label__39
I love that.  __label__39
<Laughter> {F Oh, } it's not too bad.   __label__40
tell me about the car that you've got.  __label__8
No.   __label__29
The last one they saw was HOME ALONE   __label__39
# yeah. #  __label__11
{C And, }  {F uh, } the child  needs to take pride in the fact that their parent is doing something.  __label__40
That's awful.  __label__13
Uh-huh.  __label__11
<Laughter>.   *[[slash error]] __label__40
<Breathing>. __label__43
<Laughter> I think he'll go nameless [ for the, + for the ] purposes of this conversation.   __label__40
that's going to take up what you would have made.  __label__39
Uh-huh.   __label__7
a four thousand dollar bill.  __label__1
Yeah.  __label__11
{C and, } <breathing> that's fun, trying to explain that  to a four year old <laughter>.  __label__39
It's  ((   )) . - __label__0
{F Oh } <laughter>.  __label__11
{E I mean } [ we may not, + we may not ]  have as high a standard of living --  __label__1
{D Now, } I don't know what school children,  what year that is.  __label__39
# Oh. #  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__11
Yeah,   __label__11
-- because [ I'm, + I'm ] not in physical shape for something like that,  but, {F uh, } [ I, + I ] sure would work on it <laughter>, __label__1
My Toyota did, __label__39
{E I mean, } for a while, sometimes they  come in a whole bunch of them that just,  {A I don't even, } {D you know } -- __label__39
Do you.   __label__17
{E I mean, } the, {F uh, } car air conditioners is -- __label__39
{D So } [ it's, + this book was ] interesting, though.   __label__0
# I # think every human does, } I think they'd say, yeah,   __label__1
Uh-huh.   __label__11
-- <Throat_clearing> tole painting.  __label__1
{C But, } - __label__0
I got two numbers today,   __label__39
{C and } I just don't feel that <<fade out>> ... - __label__40
Yeah.   __label__31
I'm also wondering why our taxes are still so high considering {D like } the world's probably in better shape now than it has been in the last fifty years <snorting>.  __label__32
-- I don't think it's sun exposure,   __label__28
Yeah.   __label__11
# Yeah.  __label__0
{C And } it doesn't matter if you have an unlisted number or not  because a lot of times  (( these ))  computer things will just make up numbers  at random and just call them.  __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
You see, we have the N F L [ that, + that ] Dallas -- __label__39
[ I, +  where I ] live is a house  that's seventeen years old when I bought it.  __label__39
I hope not.  {F Um, }  __label__39
Yeah,   __label__1
and then, because then our economy would be pretty bad. __label__14
we went to California this last year -- __label__39
No.  __label__29
{C but } the other day I got one about fishing   __label__39
I know what you mean.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
No,   __label__29
Oh.  __label__11
{C because } # -- __label__39
It makes,  {D you know, } pressure on the nation, and  on the people, and on the leadership, and  makes their inflation go up,   __label__40
Can you use that one for personal use?    *[[slash error]] __label__1
Yeah,   __label__7
{E I mean, } they've got Ryan,   __label__39
Okay.  __label__18
The prices, {D actually, } a lot better, because Pittsburgh is about the size, {A I've been trying to think, } like a Louisville, or  Minneapolis, that type of size.  __label__39
I agree with that.    __label__7
[ [ On the, + on ] + primarily on ] soft drink, pops and that kind of thing --  __label__39
{F Oh, } {F oh, } great.    __label__13
That way that, {D you know, } one person wouldn't get one big blunt blow at one time.  __label__39
{C and } you had to add sesame seeds and bread crumbs on top,   __label__39
except heavy metal   __label__39
{D Well, } {F uh, } I probably a little bit older than you are,   __label__39
and I have a daughter, __label__39
in Texas.   __label__1
{C and, } {D you know, } some have {D like } bonuses __label__39
{C and } if that doesn't work, to take it to the whole church.   __label__5
{D Well, } I think that is just wonderful.   __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
<Gasp> {F Oh, } that poor child.  __label__13
{F Uh, } do you mean [ a, + a ] complete reversal? __label__37
be patient.  __label__1
one girl went [ in, +  in ] state and has graduated,   __label__39
{D Well, } that sounds nice.   __label__13
Yeah,   __label__31
I, -  __label__0
{D Well, } we have got two boys  and a girl also.   __label__39
I don't know,   __label__25
he just told me this last week  that [ he, +  he ] said, don't you remember I asked them to finance it at four years   __label__39
All right,   __label__14
it wasn't forty-eight,   __label__10
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and then } they got more interested in other things,  __label__39
{D Well, } get a towel or go change.   __label__42
Yeah.   __label__11
Exactly.  __label__7
Yes.  __label__7
and things of that sort,   __label__1
[ {C and } +  {C and, so } ] I think he's done good on that stance.  __label__40
<Laughter>. __label__43
I played for the choral club in high  school   __label__1
they give each candidate perhaps, {D you know, } ten second blurbs in which  [ to, + {D you know, } to ] say, [ you, + you ] just can't get a full picture of, {D you know } -- __label__40
it's a way for me to stay home.  __label__39
Right,   __label__7
Yeah.  __label__11
I hate to see that,   __label__39
That's their ray of hope.  __label__40
{F Uh, } I don't know how good Portland will turn out to be by the end of the year.   __label__39
or biology department, one or  the other, anyway, {F uh, }   __label__1
{F Uh, } I would feel more comfortable in many cases I think with judges.   {F Uh, } {D you know, } doing the sentencing.  __label__39
<Lipsmacking> [ What, + what ] do you call Alzheimer <<mispronounced>> disease and  # stuff like that # --  __label__35
I agree.  __label__39
Have you heard anything on, {D like, } OUT FOR JUSTICE.  __label__37
Really.  __label__11
we just had, {F uh, } sleeping bags -- __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
He's going to sue the pants off of you.   __label__39
{E I mean, } you can't get it exact, {D you know, } # usually, #  __label__39
{C and, } ]  {F uh, } you don't realize how  many dishes you put onions in, __label__1
<Laughter>. __label__43
# yeah,   __label__11
It was almost really self defense, isn't it, in a case like that.  __label__38
[ for the, + for the ]  people that would be using it, {D you know, } __label__1
luckily I've always been in the engineering sector,  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__7
That's right.  __label__13
course, {F uh, } I don't know,   __label__25
{C but } # -- __label__40
{D You know, } [ that, + that's ] what  all [ c-, + ]  [ these, + these ] hearings are about   __label__40
<Laughter>. __label__43
Right,   __label__7
every time he left  the Enterprise, everything went to hell.  __label__39
-- {D you know, } really, really sick.  __label__1
{E I mean, } [ when we, + when our ] children were younger, when they were like four years old, three years old, five years old, we just had Sesame Street   __label__39
{C and } [ the parts, + I know the Audi parts  ] are terribly expensive.  __label__39
Yeah,   __label__7
After, ] - __label__1
Yeah,   __label__7
{C Or, } {E I'm sorry }  no,   __label__10
{C And, } {F um, } just kind of letting everybody live in a not very good environment <laughter>.  __label__40
Yeah,   __label__31
<Laughter> {D Well, } yeah,   __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
we're doing the same thing.    Tying it in with my husband's business trip   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F Uh, } {D well, } no,  __label__29
{C and } for too long  they've kind of lumped everybody together.   __label__40
Huh.  __label__0
-- I don't have to, -  __label__1
Yeah.  __label__11
[ {C and, } + {C but, }  ] I'm at school,   __label__39
{E I mean, } this is [ the, + the  ] place that we have to live.   __label__40
It's not like there are four or five of you there.  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
He ended up with about three sets of tools -- __label__39
they're great for an office   __label__40
yeah. #  __label__11
-- annual fees or I'll just go to somewhere else.  __label__1
{F Uh, } especially, {D you know, } in the case of murder --  __label__39
<Sigh> I won a dollar <laughter>.  __label__39
I know a lot of companies that waste so much that, -  __label__39
it really was.   __label__39
{E I mean, }  [ i-, +  ca-, ] -  __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
they get it at school and come home,   __label__40
how do you feel that is for someone [ at, +  at ] that phase in their life?  __label__35
{C and, } - __label__0
A sixty-seven [ Chev-, + {F uh, } Mustang ] is about the, {F uh, } [ top, + <noise> top ] year for the Mustang <laughter> car.  __label__40
you just draw it   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{F Oh, } okay,   __label__18
{C so, } {F uh, } I bar-, -  __label__0
When I was working up at, {F uh, } The Summit, __label__39
I never would have thought of that.  __label__39
Which is a really nice animal   __label__1
Uh huh  __label__11
-- # hardly. -  __label__1
{C and, } {F uh, } of course, {D now } [ [ I, + I do have to, ] + I remember ] one case where we had some Canadians in there who were every bit as bad,   __label__39
does yours do that too?  __label__37
{C and } then I got  some nice, {F uh, } mums at Thanksgiving that I put in the pots out there --  __label__39
{C and } my mom, {D you know, } {D like } makes -- __label__39
yeah.  __label__0
{C and } I loved THE SHINING.  __label__39
<Laughter> I think that once you do that, your children kind of develop the same attitudes.   __label__40
{D Well } he doesn't care as long as he's feeding [ his, + {F uh, } his ] family.  __label__40
# It is, # - __label__0
# Yeah.  #  __label__11
{C and } I think that, {D you know, } if they can get enough going, __label__39
-- in the, uh, computer control unit,   __label__1
# For example # that child that was shot. - __label__39
I'm an accountant   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
[ {C And so } I, + {C and } I ] wanted her to put it into the computer, __label__39
they won't make it through the summer because it gets too hot,   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__31
{E I mean } [ the, +  the ] counties are much larger.  __label__39
bye-bye.  __label__22
I can go with that answer too <breathing>.   __label__39
I just cringe every month when I see those interest charges.  __label__39
{C Then } we will try.  __label__1
{C so, } {F uh, } I keep, - __label__0
And I think it's important that they, you know, they allow a good number of people in every year   __label__40
Small island.  __label__39
<Laughter> that's another, {F uh, } {F uh, } thorn in my side, __label__39
The second thing is some colleges only offer the, {F uh, } liberal arts -- __label__39
{C And } it's nice to know something doesn't work or  something doesn't exist,   __label__40
{D Well, } [ I think, +  thinking back, I think ]  the only style I hope doesn't come back is bell bottoms.  __label__39
(( this ))  Desert Storm stuff may have, # {F uh } # -- __label__39
I like those movies that you watch time and time again.  __label__39
{C but } there [ are oth-, + are other ] things that a  regular sewing machine does that it doesn't do.   {D Like } you can't top stitch with it.  __label__39
[ {C And, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } [ it, + it ] was like pulling teeth to go get him [ to, + to ] see it   __label__39
I'm - __label__0
[ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C but, } ]  {F uh, } I've really enjoyed the weather  down here, too,   __label__39
{C but } she is getting pretty bad   __label__39
I'm trying to think what they call their soup.   __label__39
[ that's, +  that's, ] {F uh, } -  __label__0
Yeah,   __label__11
{C but } [ [ I've, + I've, ] + {D yeah, } I ] work for T I   __label__39
{F Oh, } uh-huh,   __label__11
{D Well, } I think for me, -  __label__39
I don't know,   __label__25
{C but, } {F uh, } they're certainly not up to a standard of a K O A where it's, {D you know, } a little bit cleaner.   __label__39
[ I, + I've ] seen it several times.   __label__39
but so what does that, - __label__35
[  You + [ ma-, + ] you ] probably have a little extra than you have to have, to, -  __label__40
Bye.  __label__22
I try to teach them not to get into things.  __label__39
# years ago when # they stopped putting the small V eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes.  __label__1
[ [ {C And, } +  {C but, } ] +  {C and } ] his accuracy is what's so startling with it.   __label__39
# {D [ E-, + exactly ] }   __label__7
(( Oh )) , yeah,   __label__1
{D Like } this week I've been just holding my breath and hoping they'll call me in   __label__39
I don't think this place is a very good place for him.  __label__39
[ (( I had a friend ))  in col-, + __label__39
{C And } it's more in depth.  __label__2
I don't either <laughter>.  __label__39
{C But, }  {F uh, } <<faint>> let's see,   __label__4
Uh-huh.   __label__11
Uh-huh.   __label__11
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } my kids go to school in another suburb of Dallas.  [ And, + ] with very, very good school systems.   __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
-- {C And } they had all kinds of,  {F uh, } things they could go into, agricultural,  and {D you know, } __label__40
what it's ] like then.  __label__1
[  You -- __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
# I # don't either <laughter>. -  __label__39
<Noise>. __label__43
I haven't even priced them.   __label__39
# Uh-huh.  #  __label__11
<Laughter>. __label__43
# yeah.  __label__0
now we're doing it on a, __label__39
Sure.  __label__11
{F Oh, } that's __label__13
Yeah,   __label__11
{C and, } {F um, } {D like, } [ [ when, + when, ] + {D like } when ] I do go home they enjoy just laying around me, {D you know, }   __label__39
Really.  __label__11
The first thing that I would look at would be their history. __label__40
I've been listening to that a lot lately.  __label__39
[ There, + there ] definitely even with the few disadvantages like that are far better  than the alternative.  __label__40
Yes,   __label__7
either  way, {D you know, } was great.   __label__40
{C and } you didn't have to worry about growing grass  there.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and } I'll start with a plumb line. __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__11
{F Oh, } I ye-, - __label__0
-- she's ] down in San Antonio --  __label__1
{C because } I think about that a lot,   __label__39
[ That's his, +  that's his, ] - __label__0
{C But } i-, - __label__0
{D Well, } I've even cut that down now,   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__0
{C but } they wouldn't take them.  __label__39
{C but } <laughter>. - __label__0
{F Oh, } yeah.   __label__18
until later.  __label__1
<<Very faint>> Yeah.  __label__11
The Oakland A's, and [ I think it was, +  I don't think it was ] an all California baseball.  __label__39
Okay.  __label__11
[ it's + {F um, } it's ] very hot,   __label__39
she got about two thousand dollars worth,   __label__39
I know, like a week or so ago, -  __label__39
{C and } {A kind of knock on wood } I haven't yet, not bad.  __label__39
[ {C and } -- + __label__39
we had about a thousand people gone from the base that went over there   __label__1
-- we'll talk to you later.  __label__1
Yeah.  __label__11
{D So, } - __label__0
{D You know, } __label__40
{C And, } it's very nice,   __label__40
Right.  __label__11
{F Uh, } no.    __label__29
<laughter>  also I like to be served.  <laughter>   __label__39
[ it's just,  + it was ] very strange.  __label__39
that's true.  __label__7
Yeah,   __label__11
I've maybe been into the office once in the past  (( three ))  years, {D you know. }  __label__39
number one, I really feel that that's [ my private, + {D you know, } my own  ] home.   __label__39
and they still want kind of a sports car.   __label__39
Uh, Buicks and Chevrolets.  __label__39
that's right.  __label__7
I was so upset with TEXAS that I haven't gotten into any more of his books because I thought it was just horrible.  __label__40
-- did the entire room with.  __label__1
The problem is, with a lot of it is, [ you have to go, + ] {D you know, } it takes a while to drive to these places where you recycle it,  {D you know } --  __label__39
[ areas, + the smoking area, ] {D you know, } it's closed in,  __label__39
{D Well, } [ my, +  my ]  sister [ and them +  and her ] husband do on weekends.   __label__39
[ I think, + I don't think ] it's quite as green, {D you know. }   __label__40
yeah.  __label__7
{C So } I [ was, + ] {D you know, }  didn't want him to have a job that would make him kind of be on call all the time, and have to go in at any time, and -- __label__39
They didn't order anything but the extra luxury version of whatever they got.   __label__39
{D Well, } - __label__0
{C or }  do you mostly {D like } catch up while you're at work?   __label__34
{D You know, } they get tons of magazines it seems --  __label__39
{C but } ] still, [ it's, + {D you know, } it's ]  really [ [ not, + not, ] + not ] a good quality.  __label__1
we get so involved in our work lives and <sigh> just, __label__40
I do work.  __label__39
# {C And, }  # - __label__0
--  {C and } during, {F uh, } certain wind directions because we get the, {F uh, } Gary, Indiana -- __label__39
[ knew, + {D you know, } knew ] about apartment houses that would have eight or ten or twelve people living in them, sleeping in the same bed in shifts and all that.  __label__39
<Laughter>  {C And, } {F uh, } [ it, + it ]  really makes it look professional.  __label__40
Uh-huh,   __label__11
I think it should be by a jury.   __label__40
{C but, } - __label__0
Yeah,   __label__7
They had gardening yesterday and all the  repairs,   __label__39
# Yeah,   __label__11
{D So, } {F uh, } then, do you keep kids?   __label__37
I see,   __label__18
Right.  __label__11
I agree.  __label__7
{C and, } # - __label__0
{C and then, }  {C and  then, } {F uh, } Shoeless Joe Jackson really was a player.   __label__40
These people, -  __label__39
that, {F uh, } - __label__0
Yeah.  __label__11
It adds up.  __label__40
{C but } certainly we were doing things the way we think we should do <laughter> them now.  __label__40
{C or, } {F uh, } - __label__0
{C but } this is, -  __label__0
{C And } [ they are, + those are ] expensive tests.  __label__40
Yeah,   __label__31
{C And } I think a lot of people either, don't care, or don't realize it, {D you know. }   __label__40
Okay   __label__14
<Laughter>. __label__43
Uh-huh.  __label__11
-- at some of the private schools,   __label__1
{C but } # then again. # - __label__40
{C And } he was treated like he had five fathers # or something. #  __label__39
-- {C and then } [ we, + {F uh, } we ]  swept sand in between,   __label__39
# Uh-huh.  #  __label__11
Uh-huh.   __label__11
she only taught there one year   __label__39
I try to,  __label__39
I know,   __label__7
{D Well, } I think that's neat.  __label__40
{C and }  ((   )) . __label__0
younger then   __label__1
You feel like you're a little bit out of it, don't you.  __label__37
{C  but } it says a lot about middle life -- __label__40
{E I mean, }   it looks like he's going in for a dunk   __label__39
that's right.   __label__18
{C and } a lot of parents have places to go [ and -- + __label__39
# no,   __label__29
You know.  __label__1
no,   __label__7
{C and } they don't have the right to vote --  __label__39
{C and } boy, [ it was, +  that was ] funny too, watching  him kind of burned up   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C So } [ it was a, + it was ]  good, [ it, + {F uh } -- __label__39
-- kind of the same stuff all the time, though,   __label__1
{F Oh } no.  __label__13
Okay.  __label__18
{D like } a friend of mine called it the yellow ribbon syndrome.  __label__39
{F Oh, } probably be another twelve years.  __label__39
# {C and # so, } if, {F uh, } - __label__0
In Abilene, Texas.  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11

{D You know, } [ [ walk bi-, + {D you know, } walk   [ with, + {D you know, } with  ] ] +  -- __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C So } we got the kind we wanted   __label__39
Right.  __label__11
<Noise>. __label__43
Crime is going to go up as long as the economy stays down.  __label__40
# rather ] than # -- - __label__1
I'm not sure those are AVIS or  not,   __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
<Laughter>. __label__43
[ I, + I ] certainly wouldn't want to be the executioner,   __label__39
{D You know } I, - __label__0
Yes.  __label__11
Right.  __label__11
{F Oh, } Rocky Mountain National Park.  __label__39
-- {C and } it was filmed right outside of Pierre.   __label__39
{F Oh, } yeah,   __label__7
{C So, } you're right,   __label__7
Have you seen WILD ORCHID?  __label__37
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] that's just the [ t-, + two ] weeks [ during, + during ] the summer.  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
Okay,   __label__11
(( {F Oh, } {C so, } ))  it was still a lot cheaper,  __label__40
[ there's, + there's ] always a reason why they're on sale <laughter>.  __label__40
even this year, Jay had an aptitude test, {F uh, }  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__31
I just, {D you know } -- __label__39
{C And } [ he, + he ] writes the same thing, though.   __label__39
we explained what we needed   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__0
{D Well, } Steven, it's been, - __label__22
Yeah.   __label__11
Yep,  {F uh, }   __label__11
Hey,  you should make yourself a promise that [ you'll, + you'll ] read one novel in the next  six months, just for you.  __label__8
{C and } especially now that they say, Okay, the cold war is over   __label__40
Yeah.  __label__11
{F Oh, } is it?  __label__17
we both have a budget,   __label__39
{C So, }  where, have you skied?  __label__35
{F Uh, } I've been with T I, -  __label__39
{C and } they're the ones that are the tough ones to use, {D you know. }  __label__39
-- anymore like it used to be, basic respect for -- __label__1
{C And, } {F uh, } there was no exercise.  __label__39
# It's hard # to get out a lot and do that yard work.  __label__2
-- {C but, }  {F uh, } you just took a  roller and put it on there,   __label__39
Uh-huh.   __label__11
I know,  {D you know, } from everything that you read  and you see on television now, exercise is so important to good health.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I'm not educated at all in, {F uh, } really detecting this   __label__39
{C and, } {F uh, } the, -  __label__0
{C but } it's fun.  __label__39
[ ag-, + ] we're just going to  have to adopt a completely different attitude,  __label__40
Yeah,   __label__11
{E I mean } they might be able to,  {F ah, } say that anyone who does that, {F uh, } gets certain benefits that <throat_clearing> would not be available to someone who didn't do it.   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__7
The devastation,   __label__13
Which you might call it.   __label__1
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, }  we now, -  __label__39
I'm not sure what you do.  __label__39
{E I mean } [ it, + it ] sounds good  to the public   __label__40
-- I don't really understand it --  __label__39
Country music?   __label__37
{C So } how is that?  __label__35
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C And } that might be an extra  day to put out things that might be recycled if we had [ a, +  a ] certain  colored can to put them in or  something in the city to put, {D like } either  glass or newspapers or  whatever.  __label__40
Yeah,   __label__11
{C And } you have a shop?  __label__37
[ The thing that, + __label__39
That's right,   __label__7
Do you have friends that play with you   __label__37
People actually park their car when they get to their place they're staying, townhouse or condominium, whatever they own __label__39
absolutely.  __label__7
it  really is ]   __label__1
Oh.   __label__11
Yeah,   __label__11
it's easy to do once you find a elephant foot.  __label__39
{C and } I don't know,  __label__25
right.   __label__11
{C and } I haven't helped them out [ on the me-, + on men ] particularly,   __label__39
I think so,   __label__7
{C but, }  {D well, } __label__0
-- {C but } I don't think you would, {F uh, }   __label__40
{C And then } we put the schools in the hands of professional educators instead of the teachers and the parents.   __label__40
{D Well, } I work for the state [ as, + as ] a grounds keeper.  __label__39
{C But } I do know that there are several   (( sites )) .   __label__39
# <Laughter>. #  *[[ Labelled as an indep slash unit since A's next turn is so voluminous before B.24 ]] __label__43
they ruin, <laughter>, - __label__39
How many times have you called, by the way?  __label__37
I took # a lot of my, # __label__39
At first, when it first started, [ [ it, + it, ] + it ] was hard. __label__39
what the heck was his name,   __label__41
Now, I know that {D like } Minyard's -- __label__39
Or two nights before   __label__1
{D Well, } he has eight brothers and sisters --  __label__40
A few years ago I had an Oldsmobile diesel   __label__39
# I know.   __label__7
{F Uh, } {F oh } [ you na-, + okay you name ] it.   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{C and } {D well, }  it costs two hundred dollars for books,   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
-- and # Japan and China, #  __label__1
{F Uh } Gene He-, - __label__0
-- it's not plastic.   __label__39
{C and } really society sort of dictates that, {F uh, } {D you know, } both the parents work.  __label__40
{C and, } [ I think they, + I think they ] lose sight [ of, + of ] probably what they're supposed to be doing.  __label__40
{C so } they developed this, {F uh, } drug policy [ so that, +  {F uh, } to ]  eliminate, -  __label__39
{C so, } wasn't allowed to run a lawn mower,  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
And, uh, uh, we went to, uh, Austin a while back to a basketball tournament   __label__39
It was just, __label__39
it's like, [ it's  don't, + ] {D you know, }  when you're climbing over a barbed wire fence, don't point,  lean your gun against it, {D you know, }  __label__39
{C but } -- __label__40
{F Oh, } {F oh, } that sounds wonderful.  __label__13
What I think is really going to be interesting is to see how, {F uh, } we as a society deal  with it   __label__40
{C but } I do, {D you know, }   __label__39
Oh.   __label__18
-- [ whe-, + where ] I could take recordings [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } perform experiments -- __label__1
Yeah.   __label__11
# With a # three fifty in it.  __label__39
it's ] {D actually } kind of incredible,   __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and } it does it, {F uh, } {F oh, } electronically [ some, + something,  ] __label__39
a really important thing to me is when [ they, + {F uh, } they ] pay for continuing education.   __label__39
Yeah.   __label__11
{C and then } you can put raspberry, {F uh, } topping on it --  __label__39
{C And } it's really nice for them because then they're with people their own age, and people that have gone through things exactly what they have gone through.  __label__39
Sure,   __label__11
Yeah,   __label__7
Yes.  __label__11
{F Oh, } yeah,   __label__31
Service charge you mean?  __label__19
The seasonal things.  __label__1
{C And } [ I, +  {D you know, } I ] think if we did know I think there would be a lot more chaos than  there is because [ I don't, +  I don't ]  think people could handle it.   __label__40
{C but, } {D you know, } in the past half a <laughter> dozen years,  all we've had is the, {F uh } -- __label__39
It's just that, -  __label__0
Yeah,   __label__11
{E I mean, } I was coming in from my car just a few minutes ago   __label__39
There is, course,  [ the + <noise>   the ] Grand Canyon   __label__39
it was a hassle.  __label__39
{C And, } {F uh, } I don't think, {F uh, } -  __label__0
It's called A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER.   __label__39
{E I mean, }  [ [ it's, + it had detached, ] + it had a [ dir-, + ] detached ] garage   __label__39
-- [ to, + to  ] care about [ the, + the  ] situation with their child,   __label__1
{C because } <laughter>, - __label__0
that's too bad.  __label__14
Yeah.   __label__11
((   )) . __label__43
{D Well, } the one that, -  __label__0
-- {C and } that was really pretty interesting.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__31
Uh-huh.  __label__11
hadn't been there yet.   __label__1
where do you live?  __label__35
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C but } I was still in high school,   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
I know a lot of people who, when it first be-, -  __label__39
you can get a Cadillac for, __label__39
Certainly,   __label__26
# {C But, } I think I wasn't, # -  __label__0
for all I know aerobics started out here.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
right.  #  __label__11
<Laughter>. __label__43
<Laughter> see what happens <laughter>.  __label__1
You know a car I ran across recently  that has a tremendously large trunk is the Lincoln Continental.  __label__39
Even if you took speed reading.   {F Huh. }  __label__40
[ I, +  I'm, ]  {D you know, } -  __label__0
In fact, it puts it out on Tuesdays and Thursdays <sniffing>. I can hardly wait to get that to get the local news <laughter>.   __label__39
<Throat_clearing> Tell you what we can do is,  {F uh, } I can punch the, {F uh, } one,  __label__20
make a book with it, {D you know. }  __label__1
Yes,   __label__11
yeah.  __label__11
{C because } it does, {D you know, } - __label__39
Right,   __label__7
I've talked to people at other colleges, {F uh, } that, {D you know, } -  __label__39
{C But, }  otherwise, {F uh, } I generally, -  __label__39
{D Well, } it's an Italian, {F um, } needlework, [ using, + using ] the {F uh, } -  __label__39
{C But } I think [ the, + the ] average American is probably pretty heavily in debt. [ Not, + not ] including {D like } a mortgage.   __label__40
-- jeez,   __label__13
# {D you # know,  }   __label__1
Yeah,   __label__7
Oh.  __label__11
if not the biggest yard, I've got pretty close to it, __label__39
[ {C and, } + {F um, } {C and } ] I've never thought about a cruise.   __label__39
the equality of, {F uh, }  the roles now between the sexes, I guess has been dramatically demonstrated with this war, especially compared with, {F uh, } the Vietnam war   __label__39
# {C And } # -- __label__11
Probably some of that is divorce   __label__40
Yeah.  __label__11
Uh-huh,   __label__11
# Yes, #   __label__31
<Throat_clearing> {D You know, } [ I, + <throat_clearing> I ] attended a trial in, {F uh, } Germany when I was a student   __label__39
{C and } I tried it   __label__39
-- <Noise> real helpful, {D you know. }   __label__1
I even tried making it look nicer, {D you know, }   __label__39
In Dallas,   __label__12
There were a couple downtown Dallas   __label__39
Huh.  __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
Oh.  __label__11
-- they have a teriyaki steak there,   __label__39
{D Well, } {C and } some of the issues are so emotional.  __label__40
You don't expect them to be, {F uh, } much of anything but thugs.   __label__40
{D So } that's really not roughing it so much #   __label__16
-- # [ Se- # + late sixties, ] seventies, {F uh } --  __label__27
I like to know where it's going to.  __label__39
{D well } it's nice talking to you.  __label__22
{F Oh, } are you really?  __label__37
-- everything you could imagine.   __label__1
I never had to in the past.  __label__39
He feels more ethically about it.   __label__39
Good for you.  __label__13
{C But } my car is getting old.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Hi,   __label__23
So do I.   __label__39
{C and then } for an hour and a half you hear different commentators explaining what you just heard.  __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
[ {C So } what, + __label__33
I probably could do the same thing, {F uh, } {D you know, }   __label__40
uh-huh --  __label__11
You might try that.   __label__8
they just wanted to try and catch him in something <laughter>.  __label__40
{D So, } I don't know,   __label__25
{F Huh. }  __label__11
{D Well, } [ I, + I ] guess I'm also looking at beyond even that.   __label__39
{F Um. }  __label__0
{C And } we did a lot of camping out there in the Smokeys   __label__39
Okay.   __label__18
like a challenge.  __label__1
{D you know } [ these + the ] sex and drugs on the young children and the unborn children, - __label__1
I would think  that, -  __label__40
-- down there.   __label__1
<dishes>. __label__43
no.   __label__29
<Gasp>.  __label__43
-- another day I'll be on camera,   __label__1
<Laughter>. __label__43
yeah.  __label__11
# {F Oh, } there you go,   __label__13
<Cough> That's some cold golf too, isn't it?  __label__37
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C And } they give you such high credit limits.  __label__39
it sure is fun to do that kind of thing because then you have got something to show for it.  __label__40
Meanwhile, you're living in a country club  situation perhaps, {D you know. }  __label__40
Right,   __label__7
[ I do not have any, + I don't have an ]  ounce in my body of credibility toward [ the, + the ] judicial system in -- __label__39
{D See, } {D well, } [ you, + I ] don't do it either <laughter>.  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
If you don't train your kids right then <laughter>.  __label__1
{F Um. }   __label__0
-- thirteen years ago,   __label__1
Let me ask you a question off the subject though.  __label__20
{C and  then } he has a jazz band that my older daughter was in,   __label__39
supposedly, the  maintenance records was supposed to be registered with Honda or whatever   __label__39
Yeah   __label__11
-- keep cool.  __label__1
it, - __label__0
{F Oh, } the, -  __label__0
{C but } it's just really interesting to me.   __label__39
(( I see )) .  __label__13
Uh-huh.  __label__11
-- that some other schools had.   __label__1
Do you like it out there?  __label__37
no.  __label__7
Have you heard stuff about  him lately,   __label__37
{C and so, } # - __label__0
{C but } I can't  even do that because <laughter> of the alarm. #  __label__39
-- between.  __label__1
{C But } I think [ that, + that ] {D you know, } in general the region is really in bad shape <noise>.  __label__40
<Laughter>. __label__43
I mean that's, -  __label__0
No.  __label__7
[ I've got the, + every day I've got ] to, {F uh, }  read to kindergartners,   __label__39
{C But, } {F um, } {F uh, } you mentioned the, {F uh, } glass type of stuff.   __label__39
{C So, } those ought to be coming up around spring time <laughter>.  __label__39
{C and } [ it really, + it really ] added up.   __label__39
Yeah.   __label__11
{C or } if [ yo-, + you ] have a break in the middle of the day, you take a coffee break you can always stay informed.  __label__40
You look at Frito Lay.   __label__8
{C and } it's, {F uh, } really cool <laughter>.  __label__39
{C but, } __label__11
{F Huh. }  __label__11
{C but } she never would buy me like the new designer jeans that had come out that were thirty dollars,   __label__39
{C and, }  {F uh, }  you ought to get it.   __label__8
I do respect the fact, though, that he refuses to smoke in the same room with me.   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
Right.   __label__11
{C And } what I found out is,  if you look at the bottom of those bags, Kroger or whatever -- __label__39
I haven't kept up as, {F uh, } much as I would like,  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{F Um, } [ I'm, + I'm ] concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness I guess.  __label__39
I'm from New York.  __label__39
Surely.  __label__11
we're trying to improve the computer science curriculum,  __label__39
{F Oh. }  {F O-, }  __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Seems like, {F um, } to me, everything is just changing so much that it's almost like, {F um, } you can't keep up with things any more,   __label__40
{D Well, } [ most families, +  most families ] are young   __label__39
{C And } [ that was, + {F uh, } I think that was ] probably one of the best things that had ever happened,   __label__39
Have you lost him before?  __label__37
which they do at the beginning of the season, __label__39
{C and  so } I have a lot of those.   __label__39
{D you know } we were on the scene with our team players   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
[ [ I, + I ] think # -- + __label__40
How about that.   __label__13
Maybe it wouldn't give other people ideas.  __label__40
{E I mean, } when you listen to it, it's {F um, } {F uh, } -  __label__40
{D well, } I think just most people have V C R -s now   __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
# Sure.  #  __label__13
Is that right?  __label__37
unfortunately I bought them all three at the same time, when I bought my new house,   __label__39
# I # think that's right.   __label__7
{C And } that's it --  __label__0
and we've got a minivan,  __label__39
-- {C so } that's big by itself.  __label__39
{D you know, } [ I really do-, + I really don't ] care much for them.  __label__39
# {F Oh, } I  hope, # __label__39
{C so } that was the biggest problem I saw,   __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
yeah,   __label__0
Yeah.  __label__11
It sure will.  __label__7
-- to you too.  __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C But, } {F um. } - __label__0
{C but } [ I, + I ] don't know   __label__25
{C but } [ I, + as I  say, I ] was pretty much ashamed that I hadn't read something before then.  __label__39
{F Um. }   __label__0
You ever heard of that?  __label__37
I guess it's fear <inhaling>.   __label__40
{C and } I'd just as soon a lot fewer people did.  __label__40
She likes it.  __label__39
-- steaks and everything I grill at home.  __label__1
-- I've  ] heard about that   __label__1
I think it's definitely gotten better.  __label__40
{D well, } not really.   __label__27
Uh-huh.  __label__11
# Uh-huh.  #  __label__11
{C and } [ that's, + that's ] pretty good quality time, __label__39
Yeah --  __label__7
[ {C but, } + {F uh, } __label__39
-- [ I think people, + {F uh, } I think when you ] have haves and have nots, you're always going to find people that are too lazy to figure a way to earn money and find it's easier if you can get a gun to go out and hold something up -- __label__1
I may have filled out [ on the, + on the ] form,   __label__39
it is neat to get other people.  Especially since you got other, {F uh, } ideas about [ how people, + {F uh, } how people ] react to things and stuff. Especially when it comes to, {F um, } social services.    __label__40
# <Laughter>  # if [ that + ] they'd tell me what it is I'm doing -- __label__1
{C But, }  {F uh, } [ I, + I ] don't know   __label__25
{D well, } I'm from the Dallas area.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
They have a whole lot more, {F uh, } variety of things [ [ they + they're, ] + that they ]  see and do at an earlier age,   __label__40
whoa, wait a minute,   __label__1
it's interesting, because when we cook here, -  __label__0
# I think it will. #  __label__40
and. - __label__0
{E I mean, } they were, - __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Y-, {F oh, } -  __label__0
{C And } that's all he has,   __label__39
Right.  __label__11
{C and } [ it's -- + __label__39
{C or } doesn't really matter.  __label__34
so that, {F uh, } [ it, + ] <breathing> {F uh, } the police could check up on you.  __label__1
{D Well, } [ it's, + {F oh, } I agree it's ] never too late.  __label__7
To complain about it, right?  __label__37
# {C and # so } maybe to me the key would  be [ wh-, + what ] is a [ [ chi-, + [ the, + the students ] needs,  __label__39
<Barking>. __label__43
{D So, }  that's how I ended up with a Honda.  __label__39
I guess you just have to wonder,   __label__40
{C and, } it's {F uh, } {D you know, } -  __label__0
You have got to drive careful.  __label__8
{C And } the ants would start crawling up  your legs.   __label__39
My husband would like to live there,   __label__39
# and # reduce it, {D you know, }  [ and, + and  ] not have as much of it. __label__1
uh-huh.  __label__11
{C so } I got into, __label__39
recently started, {F uh, } a bin program here in Plano where, {F uh, } -  __label__1
{F Oh, } how great.  __label__13
Yeah.  __label__11
{E I mean } right now lobbyists require to register you'd just say, __label__40
<Laughter> Right.  __label__11
yes.  __label__7
{C And, }  {F uh, } I can't really think of anything else offhand, that, {F uh, } - __label__39
{F Um. }  __label__0
Uh-huh.   __label__11
How did you get involved?  __label__35
that was limited  to five or six different places   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
-- yeah,   __label__7
Our state taxes are somewhat based on the federal.  __label__39
{C and } she said that  [ [ they recently, + {D you know, } they have to go through, ] + [ they have to, + they have to ] ]  pat the kids down, because they bring guns to school.   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__31
Uh-huh.  __label__11
that is a pretty big change.   __label__40
{C and so } while my husband was painting I went out and bought about fifty dollars worth of mums over at Calloway's --  __label__39
I have three.  __label__39
-- I know [ at, +  at ]  the regular [ gun show, +  {D you know, } gun shop -- ] __label__39
{C but } the, {F uh, } garbage men, __label__39
[ [ I don't, + I don't, ] + I like ]  to read the paper   __label__39
Usually consultants make very good income.  __label__40
{C And  then, } *[[needs slash mark]] __label__14
what can I say.  __label__32
Basically, I think [ they, + they ] really spoil the child, __label__40
{C and so } all the things come out of  [ the, +  the ] property taxes,  __label__39
# {D Well, } it, # - __label__1
Yes.  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__0
# Like to have # one thing, {D you know, } -  __label__39
they're young. {F Uh, } [ that, + ] in my work place, who are both of them earning rather decent professional salaries  who probably would consider paying a woman, {F uh, } eight or nine or ten thousand  dollars a year to take care of their child,  __label__1
[ I went to school at, + {F uh, } {D well } I went to school at ] West Virginia University,  __label__22
Yeah,   __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I don't get upset any more.   __label__39
So, of course we have a lot of animals and that type of thing raised in our area.  __label__1
Uh-huh   __label__7
-- {C but } learning disability, unless you are  schooled in the types of things and ways to help a child like that, then it makes it  real difficult --  __label__40
Right.  __label__11
[ [ We  ((   )) . + __label__39
I like Steinbeck a lot.  __label__39
{D Well, } that's one of those [ little, + {F uh, } {F uh, } little  ] extras that you don't see in [ [ [ the, + {F uh, } the, ] + the, ] + the  ] handbook, {D you know. }  __label__39
{C so } she ran off copies of the thing.  __label__39
{D Well, } I guess it would still depend on how,   __label__40
{D Well, } I'm a little bit ambivalent.   __label__39
{C and } Linda had told me they had the best mushroom soup   __label__39
{C and then } if we really think that drugs are a problem we can randomly stop anybody on the street.  __label__40
{F Uh, } I think it was called the storm.  __label__39
{D You know, } I've, - __label__0
{D So, } [ the ques-, + the question ] had something to do with usage of personal computers, {F um. }  __label__39
Yeah.   __label__7
I'd like to know, for instance, [ when I, + when they ] say, {F uh, } plastic, all plastic, what kind of plastic, __label__40
Yeah,  __label__11
Who is the competition going to be?  __label__35
No,   __label__7
# Yeah,   __label__7
{C And, } {F uh, } yeah,  __label__11
We don't have H B O.   __label__39
{C and so } people should be  advised to look for those,   __label__40
It's just my husband and I, too --  __label__39
# Yeah. #  __label__11
{D now } we had one, -  __label__39
{D Well, } {F uh, } I can't be terribly authoritative on what life was like thirty years ago, {F uh, } <swallowing> because I'm not that old yet.  __label__39
{C so. } - __label__0
<Breathing> {D well, } there should be some way of checking,  __label__40
seems so much easier just to take it and throw it in the trash, and have -- __label__39
-- of course I'm glad I did it.  __label__1
[ Did you go, + what kind of paint did you ] use on the ceiling?  __label__35
# {D you # know, } he did well,   __label__1
{D You know, } [ [ {C but, } + {C but } Ed McMahon, ] + {E I mean, } {D you know, } who cares about Ed McMahon. ]   __label__32
yeah.  __label__11
[ I don't, + {F uh, } I don't ]  like to pay the yearly fee for a card.   __label__39
{F Uh, } which, -  __label__1
you're # looking at, -  __label__0
Weren't qual-, - __label__0
now [ I have the + [ I-, + I ] have the ] I B M, P S two --  __label__39
{C but } -- __label__39
[ That, + that's ] not that much.   __label__40
# {C and } # you realize it's important that, {F uh, } -  __label__40
Yeah,   __label__7
# Yeah,   __label__7
Yeah.  __label__11
{C and } you thought there'd be just a little bit of float,   __label__39
{E I mean } -- __label__39
<lipsmack> let's see.   __label__4
Yeah <child_talking>.   __label__7
{C and } we were taking care of lawns out there,   __label__39
-- not because it's a woman's job or a man's job, but because it's dirty -- __label__1
{F Oh, } I haven't even heard of that one.  __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
{C and } they wind up <breathing> back on the streets after five years or six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in Mesquite who was out in six months.  # <Breathing>. #  __label__40
uh-huh. #  __label__11
Pay fifteen,   __label__2
#  Yeah.   __label__7
it was the same kind of thing,   __label__40
[ [ I, + I, ] + I ] realize that,   __label__39
the nursing care,   __label__1
{F Um, } I haven't really read anything like that [ [ in, + in, ] + in ] years.   __label__28
{D So. } - __label__0
once you're inside, you don't know you're in a town home.  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
It's [ the, {F uh, }   an-, +  from an animal ] shelter.  __label__39
{C and } it just goes out with our trash,   __label__39
who knows what he's going to bring home.  __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I know you can be human and Catholic,  __label__7
{C but, } - __label__0
That's about all I have, __label__39
aluminum.   __label__39
# Uh-huh.  #  __label__11
{C and } I'm wondering [ if, +   {F uh, } if ] she'll want to go out there  and go swimming next year.   __label__39
{C And then } if you get it, {D you know } then, - __label__40
{F uh, } down there, in the lower Rio Grande Valley closer to where the Rio Grande empties into the Gulf, that's interesting.   __label__40
it is, -  __label__0
# Uh-huh. #  __label__11
{C and } I was going to do basic cheese fondue,   __label__39
{C or } they,   I agree with the freedom of the press, {D you know, }   and all the amendments,   __label__39
Yeah?  __label__17
{C but } it was just so  real, realistic and  lifelike and good animation.   __label__39
# Uh-huh. #  __label__11
Uh-huh,   __label__7
{C but } people think, {F oh, } we're in the nineties, we're beyond all that,  {D you know } <laughter>.  __label__40
{E I mean } {D like } Kevin Costner did all of his own scenes   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
No,   __label__7
{C so } [ they, + they ] don't come out, turn out to vote   __label__39
{C and, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } parents come down to supervise or, __label__40
{D Now } [ it's, +  {F um, } is it ] very wooded around  where you are,   __label__37
[ I, + I ] do it every morning -- __label__39
Have you had yours now?  __label__37
# That's in the world, # or # in America?   __label__37
Yeah,   __label__11
we really did.   __label__39
and we're, we're uh, we deal,   __label__39
I can't remember a  year when we didn't have one of some kind.  __label__39
Right.   __label__7
[ you might, + you don't ] have to pay them a lot.  __label__40
No,   __label__29
{D Well } {D you know } more and more of them are,   __label__39
but I really think Ford's got a leadersi-, ship position in this right now.   __label__40
I was so good at it that it just kind of got stuck in the back of my mind and just never -- __label__39
{C But, }  we use it the same way,   __label__39
{C And } [ I think that, + {D you know, } I think ] child care for infants is much harder than when they are older,   __label__40
{C and } they have a game   __label__39
-- imagine, or not, [ they make a, + they make a ] luxury Mercury Tracer.  __label__39
I said, did you ever realize the air pollution that was, - __label__39
Okay.  __label__18
{C But } [ I am not originally, + I am originally  ] from Illinois, but, {D you know, } I have gone to college, I guess a few different places,   __label__39
{D Well, } the, {F um, } glass and the newspaper we  usually take to Walmart.   __label__39
I don't know,   __label__1
you can always play games with, {F uh, } talking about, whoa, look at this.   __label__39
do you think we've been here to in-, - __label__37
[ we,  + {C so } we ]  kept very much abreast of what was going on.  __label__39
{D Well, } you're walking okay  now obviously,   __label__38
That's true.  __label__7
{C And } it was only, I think, {F uh, } forty cents more, {D you know, } fifty cents more,   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
{C and } the ones above would.  __label__39
{F Uh, } that can be a lot of fun, too.  __label__40
{C so, } {D you know, }  they've made such advances in computers,   __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
{D Well, } yes,   __label__10
Yeah,   __label__7
[ It, + it's ] kind of pull and tug,  __label__39
{C and } I haven't  had much experience with nursing homes.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
[ {C But, } + {C but, } ] on the other hand, one of these days you'll be out looking for a, - __label__40
{C and } [ it was, + it was ] the alternator that was  blowing the fuse.   __label__39
right.   __label__7
# Uh-huh. #  __label__11
<Sniffing>. __label__43
-- {C and } they've got to do more than just [ having, + having  ] cops there.   __label__40
{C and, } {F uh, } it gives you a little bit, {F uh, } more a glimpse of [ the, + the ] real world   __label__40
She was inaugurated in January,   __label__39
-- {C but } after that he did fine.  __label__39
{C but, }  {F uh, } during the week they often have, [ a, +  a ] limited menu choice   but, {F uh, } very reasonable complete dinners for six ninety-nine that # included # -- __label__39
Yeah,   __label__7
If you get four milk cartons and that fills up trash bag, {D you know } <laughter> pretty easily,   __label__39
{C and } that's about it.  __label__39
{C and } I said, {D well, } [ we won't tell him it's a c-, + we won't tell her it's a cat,  ] __label__39
Uh-huh <laughter>.   __label__11
his company [ went broke. + {E I mean } went, {D you know, } bankrupt. ]   __label__39
[ {C an, } +  {C and } ] their parts are supposed to be guaranteed [ and, + and ] everything   __label__39
We used to live in Utah --  __label__39
{C so, } - __label__0
It must be a rotten job for everybody <laughter>.  __label__40
I'm not heavy, {D you know, }   __label__39
How about you?  __label__33
[ {C So, } + {C but }  ] yeah,   __label__0
mixed up inside. <breathing> [ when, + __label__1
Because I use to live in Oakland.  __label__1
For sixteen bucks [ they'll -- + __label__39
{C And } [ it's + ] things like tobacco  [ are, + ] {F uh, } [ they're, + they're ] a proven health hazard to # smokers # -- __label__39
{C And, } {F uh, } one thing, they don't spend as much time just teaching reading  and  writing,   __label__40
Right.  __label__11
That's true.  __label__7
yeah.   __label__11
{C so } I am not looking around here.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Regular gas engine,   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
It is Friday,   __label__39
{C But, } - __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C And } the tax payment went to pay  for the services that I was getting as [ a, +  a ] resident of that particular county.  __label__39
-- spring, {D you know, } all summer long.  __label__1
{C and } # you know how it is.   __label__38
Yeah,   __label__7
The, {F uh, } -  __label__0
That's frightening, too.  __label__13
{F Oh, } goodness.  __label__13
Yeah.  __label__11
That was just a one time thing right after Christmas.  __label__39
or whatever.  __label__1
# really. #  __label__7
I don't think, -  __label__1
{C and } he just didn't make that kind of money with five children.   __label__39
Right.  __label__11
n-, she'd never even meet them   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
<Laughter>. __label__43
Yes,   __label__31
no,   __label__4
{C But } there is usually two or three days in the week that you can get out there and play,   __label__40
-- realize why I don't want to [ re-, + ] go back to work <laughter>. __label__1
I can imagine.    __label__13
{C so } I haven't really gone,   __label__39
Right.  __label__11
I don't make a lot of money   __label__39
-- I don't know.  __label__1
It's the best car in the class for the [ be-, + cheapest ] amount of money.   __label__39
Yep.  __label__11
# {D you know, } to # him, - __label__1
yeah,  __label__7
{C and } I like to listen to that and catch, {D you know, } -  __label__39
<Throat_clearing>. __label__43
{C And } I guess that's a way of budgeting.  __label__39
it's just like you say,   __label__40
{D Now } [ how many, + how many ] people are in his immediate family?  __label__35
{F um, } [ if, + if  ] an employee is especially exemplary, I think it's often, -  __label__40
you too.  __label__22
-- {C and } that has pretty well limited my fishing to fresh water --  __label__39
{C and } very often the artist will have [ a d-, + an album ]   __label__39
In that it seems to me that they are swayed more by  emotion than, {F uh, } by evidence that's presented.   __label__39
{F Oh, } I think so.  __label__7
{C and, }  {F uh, } anyway,  {C so } [ a-, + ] this piece obviously, {F um, } -  __label__39
[ {C and } +  {E I mean, } {C and } ] they come in all si-, {D you know, } -  __label__39
we saw it at the movies,   __label__39
I knew you were going to say that.   __label__39
I'm having fun, <<pause>>   __label__5
{F Oh, } my.  __label__13
yeah.  __label__7
{C And } hopefully he won't have too many surprises when he gets home.  __label__39
It was something like that <laughter>.  __label__25
{D You know, } I don't know [ for, + if ] you're familiar with that or not.  __label__38
{F Uh, } Northern State University in Aberdeen, South Dakota.  __label__39
{F Oh, } {F gosh, }  {F oh, } {F gosh. }  __label__13
[ it, + once it ]  hits the top of the liquid it seems to make little balls  and stuff on the top.  __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
-- traveling with them to look at different -- __label__1
{C but } -- __label__40
Yeah.   __label__11
so obviously you're into education.  __label__38
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Right.   __label__7
<Rustling>. __label__43
That's right.   __label__13
{F Um, }  I don't know,   __label__25
Right.  __label__11
-- {C and } it's grown in leaps and bounds.   __label__39
We've been talking for five minutes?  __label__22
[ {C And then }  the, +  {C plus } the ] time that you waste standing in line is valuable also.  __label__40
go back to that one to ten scale where one, __label__8
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C And } that's not giving a good example to students.  __label__40
Just a leafy, -  __label__0
It's hard finding an area to do a dissertation in this field.  __label__39
That meaned she was warned.  __label__40
{D You know, } this is like a cruelty joke,   __label__40
I was a little kid then,   __label__39
# Yeah.   __label__7
I was exposed to a lot of music when I was younger.   __label__39
Have you faced, {F uh, } elderly care yet, {F uh, } nursing home care for any of your parents?  __label__37
Apparently they're very difficult to play with,   __label__40
have done ] some business up in Baltimore,   __label__1
Yeah,   __label__7
{F Uh, } {C but, } {F uh, } it could be better,   __label__40
{C and } it lasts along time.  *[[along -> a long]] __label__39
{D You know } since the women's movement in the, [ wh-, + ] seventies,  __label__1
{D Well } it will be fun for you to watch up there anyway -- __label__40
Right.  __label__11
{C and } last year a bunch of teachers had an aerobics class.   __label__39
{C or, } - __label__0
{C But } [ I, + I ] just feel [ that, + that ]  capital punishment needs to stay within the system.   __label__40
I don't either.   __label__39
yeah.   __label__11
Yeah,   __label__7
I just, - __label__0
{C and, } - __label__0
It never did get anything  but just moderately warm,   __label__39
[ I, + if I -- ] __label__39
# {D Well, } We # really want to have a family.   __label__39
{D Well, } any of the guys that were  ground  ((   )) -  __label__0
{C and } really, after awhile it really gets annoying,  __label__39
<Throat_clearing>. __label__43
{C and } I know a lot of teachers that would like to try it.  __label__39
[ I, + I ]  really don't see anything wrong with it,   __label__39
yeah,   __label__7
{C and } they do the same thing over, __label__40
<Laughter>  {F Oh, } I don't know,   __label__25
Hence is possible error as you  can see in all the IRONSIDES, __label__40
it's one of the ways that young girls feel that they are maturing,   __label__40
# really well.  #  __label__1
[ I, + I ] tried it once or twice,   __label__39
-- and had ten children,   __label__1
How about you guys?  __label__33
The rooms are nice and large   __label__39
Do you want to hear about my other animals I've had?  __label__37
# Yeah.   __label__31
it always seems like I'm doing that   __label__40
{D Well, } [ the way I, + the way I ] see it, is, -  __label__40
No # doubt # --  __label__7
every time I see something like  that I think, {D well, } [ that's, + that's ] an anti-metric argument.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
# {F Oh, } {D well, } good.   __label__13
Do you eat any of them?  __label__37
I know, I, -  __label__0
{C and, } {F uh, } [ we, + we ] can watch those all night sometimes if, - __label__39
Hey, how you doing?  __label__23
{F Uh, }  __label__4
{C but, } you know, that,  {D now } even -  __label__0
{C So } I don't know  <laughter> <noise>.  __label__25
It kind of traveled around <laughter>   __label__2
((   ))  shoot I need one of those <laughter>.  __label__39
{E I mean } {C but } [ where are they, +  where are they, ]   __label__35
{C and } I just don't have the patience to just, {D you know, } do something.  __label__39
{F Oh, } yes.  __label__7
this poor gifted child is being ignored.  __label__1
{C and, } {E I mean }  it just winds up costing the taxpayers  [ a, + {D you know, } a ] fortune to keep doing that.  __label__40
{C so, } - __label__0
{F Oh, } yeah.  __label__11
{C and }  (( strange ))  it seems that, {F uh, } - __label__40
Yes,   __label__7
<Laughter>. __label__43
{D Well, } [ I, + {D you know, } [ I don't, + I don't ] ] know  all that much myself,   __label__39
-- were in school.  __label__1
All right.   __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F Hm. }  __label__11
Uh-huh.   __label__11
{C And, }  {F uh, } [ h-, + his ] big thing is that he can take [ pieces of, + little bits ] and  pieces of string and baling wire and turn them into fantastic different things.   __label__39
-- public,   __label__1
I seen an old woman today,   __label__39
{C and } we still have the  (( Greensboro ))  Open here every year.  __label__39
We got into it because of SEATO agreement, back just right after World War Two that, <noise> {F uh, } we pledged a mutual, {F uh, } {F uh, } defense [ of, + of ] the South Vietnamese,   __label__39
And I d-, drive, uh, -  __label__0
# Yes.   __label__11
That's mostly locally,   __label__39
{C And } the-, -  __label__0
Parents around here just let their kids run  everywhere,   __label__40
That's the thing,   __label__7
A lot of them have had, {F um, } limbs amputated, or, {F um, } have serious illnesses. __label__39
# Right,   __label__11
we don't want you to go through the work and then find out that this doesn't really work anyway, and et cetera,   __label__5
# That's right. #  __label__7
I went to the gym every day   __label__39
Okay,   __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__1
They [ do it [ by, +  {F uh, } by, ] + do it by ] lethal injection.  __label__39
We're like everybody else, {D you know, }   __label__40
[ we, + I ] just started yesterday.  __label__39
That's what I'm saying [ that, + that  ] pensions, -  __label__39
<laughter>.  {D Well, } yeah   __label__7
{C and } it's fun.  __label__39
{C and } I'm in Garland <laughter>.  __label__23
{D Well, } {D you know, } that's interesting because  one thing that always brings to my, {F uh, } husband's mother's side together is, {F uh, }  they talk about the genealogy of the family tree every time   __label__39
{D Well, } I guess then, I will go,   __label__8
and, {F uh, } up through that area.   __label__1
Uh-huh,   __label__11
{C and } we went to  the Boundary Waters area in Minnesota.   __label__39
spread it out because you keep the cream cheese kind of thin.  __label__8
{C and } [ I, + I ] look up at the clock and say, {F oh, } my word, {D you know. }  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{C but }  I think your mayor, -  __label__40
{D Well, } that's interesting.  __label__13
{C so } I get to see the different ways that they, __label__39
-- {D you know, } they get lesser sentences   __label__1
-- {C and, }  {F uh, } you don't get near the, {F uh, } quality of education <cough>,   __label__40
I try to,  __label__39
That is nice.  __label__40
[ {C but, } +   {C but } ] I think somewhere that got lost. __label__40
Right,   __label__11
-- {C but } [ we just, + we just ] have dogs [ and, + {F um, } <laughter> -- __label__39
{C But } it was a fun movie to watch.  __label__39
{C and } it could hamper the outcome of an election for the guy that should have won.  __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yes,   __label__31
[ [ {C and then, } +   {F uh, } {C and then } ] +  [ you, +  {C and then } you ] ] pass it on.  __label__40
-- role.  __label__1
no   __label__7
No-, -  __label__10
{D Well } {C and } I still think that,  having lived in Europe for awhile, {D you know, } <throat_clearing> difference in living conditions -- __label__40
[ that, + {C but } [ that's a, + that's an ] ] impossibility, I think -- __label__40
Yeah.  __label__11
{C And, }  {F uh, } - __label__0
uh-huh.   __label__11
{C or } [ you can, + you can, ] {D you know, } do, {F uh, } testing on the ground itself at that point,  __label__39
I'll bet you did.  __label__13
[ I never, + it was never ] my own car --  __label__39
{C But, }  {F uh, } do you recycle?  __label__37
My son will graduate from high school this year,   __label__39
-- if you handle it just like you would like a check or cash -- __label__1
{C so, } __label__39
{F Huh. }  __label__11
Oh, boy.  __label__13
{D Well, } I do love to fish.  __label__39
Yeah.   __label__7
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and } I thought it would be more reliable.  __label__40
Yes.  __label__31
# {F uh, } # were, {D you know, } mom was like, {F um, } [ Mrs Cleaver, + {F uh, } {D you know, } June  Cleaver ] or whatever,   __label__1
they're saying absolutely no gun control, __label__40
Right.  __label__11
My name is Fernando.   *[[sd]] __label__1
{D actually } [ I, + we ] saw her just the other night too.  __label__39
No.  __label__7
Yeah,   __label__7
I would hope.  __label__39
I think I've eaten fish like twice since. -  __label__39
{E I mean, } [ they, + you ]  can love them all you want   __label__40
I have a sister,   __label__39
Uh, we're, our, our, we won't have any more licensed drivers for about thirteen years.  __label__39
{C But } [ it's, + it's ] quite an  undertaking.   __label__39
{C and } Baylor has a band camp.  __label__39
the thing that ] gets me is that while we're supporting them, __label__1
Right,   __label__7
Uh-huh,   __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Sounds like i-, - __label__0
Yeah.   __label__7
I mean I did watch T V   __label__39
# Yeah. #  __label__11
We had a boat   __label__39
{D Well, } [ [ I, + I just live in a, ] + I live in an ] apartment now.   __label__39
Okay, <lipsmack> {F uh, }   __label__4
{C and, }  {F uh, } it's just a matter [ of, + of ] trust, {D you know, }   __label__39
{F Oh, } uh-huh.  __label__11
{D you know, } I do a lot of business here,   __label__39
Yeah.   __label__31
Of course, {F um, } dinner parties down here probably, {F oh, } turn out to be more things like barbecues <laughter>.   __label__39
-- {C and } they kind of are in different spectrums, I think.  {F Um, }   __label__39
Mysteries.   __label__12
[ [ {C And, } + {C and, } ] + {C but, } ] {D you know, } when you go to the store [ and, + and ]  you're trying to figure, {D you know, } {D well } this box [ [ [ is, + is, ] + {F uh, } is, ] + is ] twelve ounces -  __label__40
<Laughter> I'm twenty-six.  __label__39
{F uh, } was, {F um, } carrying their  ((   ))    __label__1
I guess down here, {F uh, } -  __label__0
My wife is not an academic at all.   __label__39
These are children that are born with low [ deficit, + attention deficit  ] --  __label__40
Uh-huh <<very faint>>.  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__31
{C and } we're not in Dallas county,   __label__39
[ {C And, } + {C and, } ] {D you know, } I think [ this, + after you've done it a certain amount of time, it ] kind of does get to be a routine.  __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D Like }  I am, -  __label__0
I've been told that this flex hour and those kind of  (( things )) , - __label__39
{C but, } __label__39
That's it,   __label__39
{C and then } you end up tediously scraping these tiny little shreds of masking tape <laughter>.  __label__39
Oh.  __label__11
{F Oh, } my God.  __label__13
{C but, } {F uh, } when they had, {F uh, } Akeem -- __label__39
it's like, - __label__40
{C And, }  [ they, + they, ] __label__40
-- {D you know. }   __label__1
-- she was able to come back home   __label__1
{C and, } the, {F um, } - __label__0
{C And, }  {F um, } it's a rent house   __label__39
{C So, }  {F uh, } it had to have everything  done from top to bottom to having it leveled, jacked up, {F uh, } new plumbing,  new wiring, wallpaper, paint,   __label__39
Bye-bye.  __label__22
# Right. #  __label__7
I don't know how  people can afford kids.   __label__39
Actually, [ I, + I  ] don't know whether it made, -  __label__39
And family support,   __label__1
It was like, don't you remember me.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
no argument here.  __label__7
{D Well, } [ [ I, + I'm ] not really certain how  I, + {F uh, } I'm   not certain [ that, + that ]   it ] does a lot of good.  {E I mean, } that it [ ends up, + ends up ] effectively, {F uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, } avoiding a lot of the crimes that have capital [ punishment -- + __label__39
{C so } it's, {D you know, } -  __label__0
Yeah   __label__0
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] I'm looking at it as a change.  __label__39
-- for it.  __label__1
Yeah.  __label__11
{F Oh, } I see.   __label__18
{C and then } he came out with, {F uh, } {D see, } for example, [ his, +  his ] record {D like, } No Jacket Required.  __label__39
{C And } <static> [ they, + they ] put this one out   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
[ {C Or, } +  {F uh, } {C or } ]  there should be some way where it could be opted for them not to have a jury.   __label__40
I was a season ticket holder of the  Cowboys for years,   __label__39
[ that's, + that's ] [ [ our  pro-, + our, ] + our ] daughter's problem, {D you know, }  'cause [ when you, + when you ] get out on the road like that  [ and + ] it's just long stretches, {D you know, } where they just have  to sit, {D you know. }   __label__39
I, -  __label__0
I know at work, {F uh, } people always complain to me   __label__39
I never  ((   )) , __label__39
{C But } the way [ our system, + our court system ] works, that guy is going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time.  __label__40
-- {C and } even the ones that we rent at home, the trouble with some of them I know, -  __label__39
-- # find ways # around.   __label__1
Uh-huh.   __label__7
Right.  __label__11
[ [ D-, + do, ] + do ] you get cable?  __label__37
Probably.  __label__40
<Laughter>.  __label__43
-- {C but } more than that, I don't think that they have the authority to command the attention of the children.  __label__40
Uh-huh.   __label__11
{D you know, } [ in the, + in the back, ] -  __label__0
you sound pretty young,   __label__40
# was, # {F uh, } a very, {F uh, } self-sufficient, {F uh, } wealthy <noise>, {F uh, } town, __label__1
that's right,   __label__13
{C and, } {D you know, } if something goes wrong with  it within the first year we've got an automatic guarantee on it besides the manufacturer's guarantee.  __label__39
course we live in [ a, + a  ] rural sort of setting --  __label__39
<Music> Uh-huh.   __label__11
{C and } in Germany they don't have the jury system.   __label__39
Blacksburg.   __label__12
-- a murder take place   __label__1
Yeah.   __label__11
Beverly.  __label__39
Right.  __label__11
<laughter>  Maybe we'll talk to you again.  __label__22
Oh.  __label__11
[ I don't know what, + {F uh, } [ I, + I ] don't know what ] the problem is   __label__39
[ I've been, +  I've, ] -  __label__0
Huh-uh.  __label__11
there's a variety,   __label__39
Bye-bye.  __label__22
{F Oh, } you fish upstream?  __label__38
{C Or } people, {D you know, } __label__0
{C so } [ I, + I ] find myself being [ a l-, + a  bit ] abrupt and a little bit ruder [ than +  <breathing> than ] I might normally be --  __label__39
{C and then } I would be at my school, __label__39
{F Oh, } it is probably in there just burping goldfish.  __label__40
They knew the sucker when they saw one.   __label__39
-- those guys, they just kind of get into,  [ [ to s-, + s-,  ] +  stewing ] up trouble, {D you know. } __label__1
Gun control seems to be a rather, {F uh,} timely topic, with all that's going on legislation wise.  __label__40
it beeps in at ten minutes.   __label__39
<Noise>. __label__43
{C And } fifteen dollars of it was because she was over the limit   __label__39
{C because } what was happening was, {D you know, } all the very rich people [ went out to the, + move out to the ] suburbs   __label__40
{C but } we decided it wasn't worth us keeping it   __label__39
Otherwise, he might have been driving trucks or framing  houses, {D you know, } from here to eternity.  __label__40
Do you have major medical benefits?  __label__37
{C but, }  {F uh, } I usually end up getting money back.   __label__39
because ] they got {D like, } {F uh, } {D like } [ special, + {D like } especially ] things, that, {D like, } fuck with your mind.  __label__1
{F Uh, } [ what, + what's ] your budget situation?  __label__35
astonishing what the younger ages know,   __label__40
The other world,   __label__11
{C so } it's kind of a double annoyance.   __label__39
{C 'cause } if she fell in then I'd [ of been, + had to go ] in after her.  __label__39
# {D You know, } # you just don't know.  __label__40
-- what am I working for today <laughter>.  __label__1
[ [ It's, +  {F uh, } {D you know, } it, ] +  it's ] changing the rules in the middle of the game  basically   __label__40
Yeah,   __label__7
Our lot in life is to make her life miserable   __label__5
this is Hank Williams -- __label__39
Oh.  __label__11
{F Oh, } yeah.   __label__7
I just felt terrible.   __label__39
{C And } I changed my mind,  __label__39
{C But } I found it hard to deal with  [ the, + the ] dealership I was going through.  __label__39
{C And } it was somewhat melodious,   __label__39
I don't either.   __label__39
{C and } he's going to remember it.  __label__40
{C and } we passed it a long time ago.  __label__40
<laughter> I really can.   __label__39
# Uh-huh.  #  __label__11
It was nice talking with you.  __label__22
Spoons and, - __label__2
<Lipsmack>. __label__43
there're -- __label__40
((   ))  something happen. -  __label__22
[ {C but } h- # -- + __label__39
They've in fact had to excuse school down here because of that.  __label__39
No,   __label__29
Then you only go there as a last resort.  __label__40
Yeah.   __label__7
{C and } that was part of the problem, when they went into the promise land,   *[[ should be promised land]] __label__40
go ahead.  __label__8
Do you have any children?  __label__37
{F Um, } {C and } that is a very, -  __label__0
Uh-huh.   __label__31
{C But } she came to our house   __label__39
I really don't know which brand it is.   __label__28
<Laughter> Yeah,   __label__7
that's too soon.   __label__39
which -  __label__0
they have a big truck that has {D like } [ [ te-, + not ten, ] + maybe five ] big doors on the side of it,   __label__39
was ] licked.   __label__1
Right.  __label__11
Bye.  __label__22
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C or, } {F uh, } [ they, + they've ] signed for a friend.   __label__39
{F Oh, } yeah.   __label__11
You killed, __label__40
it just seems like  there's just never enough time to pick it up and do it,   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__1
{D Well, } it's been interesting to talk to you.  __label__22
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C And } it was all a big package deal -- __label__38
That's what it all  boils down to in the end, usually anyway.  __label__40
Right,   __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
it does.  __label__39
My neighbor across the street  has one.   __label__39
-- {C and } they have to, - __label__39
it's not.   __label__39
-- now [ you, + {D you know, } you ] can tell the change, for sure.  __label__1
WHERE'S BOB? or WHAT ABOUT BOB?  __label__1
{F Oh, } really?  __label__17
-- {F uh. } __label__1
I think my dad put some.   __label__39
{C And, } {F uh, } she wanted me to bring it in,   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
#  ((   ))  # {F Um. }  __label__0
-- {C and } where she works she has no benefits at all.  __label__39
# there's a little boy just  got shot and killed {D like } last weekend down in what they call the projects, # which is # -- __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
# {D Well } all that stuff   __label__14
Huh-uh.  __label__29
Uh-huh.  __label__11
That's right.   __label__7
Yeah.  __label__11
-- and say, you threw this away <laughter>.  __label__1
-- for me.   __label__1
No,   __label__29
Oh go-, - __label__13
Yeah   __label__11
{C and } I just had the biggest grin on my face.  __label__39
getting thrown back I guess is all that, {F uh, } happens.  __label__39
{C And } I know [ that, + that ] the Southeast Asians, the Hmong people  that I've done some work with, {F uh, } feel very quite hurt [ and, + and ]  unsure of themselves when here.   __label__39
[ What do you think about, + what do you think about ]  [ the, + the ] lower grades, {D you know, } # K through seven? #  __label__33
that was, -  __label__40
Spectacular is a good word for them <laughter>.  __label__7
They're still doing business.  Big business, apparently.  __label__39
cold and impersonal,   __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Right.   __label__11
I think that's probably [ a, + sort of a  ] thing to do -- __label__40
{F Oh, } sure.   __label__7
No,   __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D Well, } {D see } [ {C and, } + {C and } ] that is, {F uh, } the sort of the thing of the nineties is -- __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
they would check him over [ to, + to, ] {D you know, } the basic checks.   __label__39
<noise> [ {C so, } + {C but } ] [ he, + he's ] <noise> <<Snapped fingers>> <child_talking> always sick.   __label__39
That's right <laughter>.  __label__7
{C And } you -- __label__39
{C and } when I am doing that, {F uh, } and feeling loose  [ and, + ]  that I swing better,   __label__39
{C and then, } {D you know, } arrangements are made {D like } during the Summer for {D you know, } {F um, } food and [ whose, + whose ] staying where, because a lot of people  [ fro-, + are from ] down here, in Texas.  __label__39
<Lipsmack>. __label__43
[ I, + I ]  like to go out to eat,   __label__39
It really is. __label__7
{C and } my son will be in  next year   __label__39
{C but } I don't have <laughter> any flowers on it.   __label__39
Sometimes,   __label__7
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F Uh, } I think they're handy.   __label__40
(( Right )) .  __label__0
<Buzz>. __label__14
{F Oh, } neat.  __label__13
Is that right?  __label__37
What about you?  __label__33
{D Well, } they, {F uh, } -  __label__0
Look at this  (( they ))  sent me this money, {D you know. }   __label__5
# {F Oh, } yes. #  __label__7
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Your family's from where?  __label__36
No,   __label__7
{D So, } it's pretty interesting work   __label__40
How are they built?  __label__35

{E I mean, } we've got houses two streets away that are probably around seventy, eighty thousand --  __label__39

Portland. #  __label__26
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I'm more or less, if they told me I had to {D well } then fine,   __label__39

{C and }  {D you know, } <laughter>, {F um, } {D boy, } [ after, + {D you know, } after ] about two months  I realize this girl really has some deep set emotional problems.  __label__39
{C But then } if you deteriorate, {F um, }  they have a separate section for those who need care -- __label__39
That's too much trouble.   __label__5

[ That's, + that's ] nice.   __label__13

huh-uh.   __label__29
Interesting.   __label__13
{F Oh, } it's an excellent movie.  __label__39

than someone that just goes right straight into college.  __label__1
I -- - __label__0
{C and } I must say I attracted a lot of attention.  __label__39
I do three hundred sit ups a  day now, but not [ at that, +  in the ] morning,   __label__39
{D you know, } it's right there at the very foot of the Rockies.   __label__39
{C And } they can do that in about four minutes.  __label__39
{F Oh } my goodness.  __label__13
-- {C and } [ I, + I ] feel like it's really just within the United States.   __label__39

# Uh-huh. #  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__7
{F uh, } the homes that were here earlier  were smaller.   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__31
goll-, -  __label__13
I keep ] thinking that there's got to be some way, [ that, + that ] a lot of this is circumstances.   __label__1
{F Oh, } gosh.  __label__13
# {F Um. }  #  __label__0
{F Oh, } I don't know.   __label__30
{C and, } {F oh, } then we watch AMERICA'S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS.   __label__39
{E I mean } like I say, we've come a long way, but we have, {E I mean, } twice as far to go, __label__40

{C but. } - __label__0
{F Uh, }  with lots of kids you don't have lots of money for recreation.  __label__40
{C And } it's turned out that, that's been very true, what he was forecasting about the accumulation [ of, + of ] the pollutants in the air and the acid rain and what it would do to foliage.   __label__39
<Noise>. __label__43
{F uh, } Tex-Mex, {F uh, }   __label__12
{C and, } __label__40
{C and } for awhile I didn't read a newspaper when I came out here because I didn't find one that I liked.   __label__39
[ {C but } -- + __label__39
Okay,   __label__7
{C so } I'm here all the time.  __label__39
{C but } [ I, + I ] find interesting tidbits in what the news reports as far as [ the, + {D like } the ] state of North Carolina's budget, and stuff like that.    __label__39
[ {C So, } + {F um, } {C but } ] [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] understand what you say about the environmental movement,   __label__39
when he saw where I, {D you know, } saw my later teenage years, he was just, I hate to say aghast, because that sounds so  trite,   __label__39
Right.  __label__11
I, {F uh, } - __label__1
-- and things like that.  __label__1

{C and } I went back tonight also.  __label__39
Oh.  __label__11
{C but } I live in D C -- __label__39
I was working at the Dallas site.   __label__39
{F Um. }  __label__0
-- I think.  __label__1
Yeah,   __label__7
{F uh, } {C and } I see some that way.   __label__39
I've never, -  __label__0
{F Oh, } do you.   __label__17
{D Well, } my husband was with, {F uh, } <<tape begins to be much clearer, a lot less back ground noise and fuzz>> University of Oklahoma and, __label__39
didn't know if it was General Motors or who,   __label__1
{C And then, } {F um, } the other place is called the Vienna Inn  which is, {F uh, } {F uh, } -  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D Well } what happens is that if people start [ becoming + having ] chronic illness [ and, + and ] things like that, -  __label__39
that's right.  __label__7
I brush it on,   __label__39
{C and } I liked him.  __label__39
{C but } that person wasn't even anywhere near there, {D you know. }   __label__39
# want to # rob a bank?   __label__1
Right.  __label__11
{F uh, } then they ate ] out on the ground.  __label__1
Right.  __label__7
# {F Uh. } #  __label__11
-- [ [ p-, + pa-, ] + programs ] person's involved in    __label__1

{C and } it shrinks too much   __label__39
Because they, - __label__0
Yeah. #  __label__0
{F Uh, } the interesting thing [ is, +   is ] [ that, + ]  {F uh, } the amount of money you [ can +  can ] run up on them.   __label__40
{C and } we grow a lot of food.  __label__39
# Bye-bye. #   __label__22
Yes   __label__7
-- fully auto, -  __label__0
{C And } I guess we had most of it done   __label__39
what is the name of that company.   __label__41
{F Oh, } yeah?  __label__17
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] she was telling me all her problems, {D you know, }  __label__39
Which, again, I think [ it + ] helps a woman's role.  __label__40
#  (( Yeah )) . #  __label__11
<Laughter> gets a lot of people [ in, + in ] trouble <laughter>.  __label__40
yeah.  __label__11
-- and Faron Young --  __label__1
Bye-bye.  __label__22
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C but } we <laughter> won't be going because, {F um, } I don't know how  they thought of this, it's going to be on a cruise,   __label__39
They were always having to meet in the catacombs and all this,   __label__40
I went to Mackinaw Island -- __label__39
{C but, }  {F uh, } when my wife and I first moved in, it was just the two  of us.   __label__39
I guess we can't win <laughter>.  __label__40
Uh, the only other thing I have noticed though is that, uh, it seems that there's been a lot of or more empha-, emphasis at least in what we've been dealing with -  __label__40
some of them, they used to be a hundred dollars <noise>,   __label__39
{C and } he's concerned about it but, __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I don't know how, # -  __label__0
{C and } what kind of state are we in [ if, +  if ] most people are going to private schools.  __label__32
I just started doing this   __label__39
{D Well, } [ I, + I ] think that that's the thing that's a little bit scary, {D you know, } a little bit tough about putting them in a rest home is [ it's, + it's ] almost like  __label__40
# it's because [ there's not a # + there's no  ] [ insulation, + <noise> insulation ] in those things.  __label__39
{F Um. }  __label__0
{F Oh, } yeah.  __label__11
-- {C And } I'm not fond of some of those things   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__31
{C And } now our care plans look more like thirty-two, thirty-three --  __label__39
[ the, + the  ] N F L draft really seems to be doing its job   __label__40
{C And } {D you see, }  I think him going in and doing that would be putting us in another Vietnam situation.  __label__40
-- in any means   __label__1
Uh-huh.   __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
# a lot # of people are.  __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
That's  [ a, + why it ] hasn't made all that much difference is because [ the, + with the ] civil service, that [ you could take, + you could take ] your vacation in increments of one hour --  __label__39
it's [ like, + like ] -  __label__0
{D Well, } in nineteen-three they started experimenting with chlorinating the water.   In nineteen-thirteen most of the major cities,   __label__39
we, -  __label__0
{F Uh, } no   __label__14
It's not -- __label__40
[ from the S-, + from  ] South America, __label__1
what should I say   __label__5
{C But, } I don't know,   __label__25
-- to kind of accommodate us, too.   __label__1
{C But } it really gets down to the particular teacher.  __label__40
Insurance won't pick this up unless you're in the hospital.   __label__39
What you, - __label__0
Yeah.  __label__11
Uh-huh,   __label__11
{F uh, } {F oh, } shoot,   __label__13
-- they really [ should have, + should have  ] expected it. __label__1
I wouldn't have thought that Pillsbury [ [ could, + would, the, ] + {E I mean, } {E or } even had ] chem-, + {D you know, }  {D well, } -  __label__39
{C But } I've been pretty lucky,   __label__40
-- is really expensive.  __label__1
Oh.  __label__11
Oh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__7
Here in Indiana [ we pay, + {F uh, } we pay ] county income tax, state income tax,   __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
Yeah,   __label__7
-- {C but } I have a very, very busy extra life anyway.   __label__39
what is it, {F uh, } the act where they had to cut everything across the board --  __label__35
{F Oh, } that's interesting.  __label__13
{E I mean, } it just ran the gamut of emotion.  __label__39
{D Well, } good.  __label__13
Uh-huh.  __label__11
# Um-hum.  #  __label__11
{D well, } it used to be the largest bank in San Antonio until  N C N B came up and bought the rival   __label__39
[ {C And, } +  {C and } ] that's it,   __label__39
{C So } [ we're going to, + they're going to ] stay there.  Which is fine, because Arlington's got a lot of things to offer.   __label__39
how much is it a month?  __label__35
And, {F uh, } wait for an opportunity to use it.  __label__39
# {D So. } # - __label__0
I thought, yeah, right come tell me about it, __label__39
yep.  __label__7
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{E I mean, } if you get convicted of,  {F uh, } {D you know, } drug trafficking, they just kill you.   __label__39
The, -  __label__0
really.  __label__11
{C and } we have to worry about, {F uh, }   maybe people are becoming [ more aware, + [ more, + more ] afraid ]  of -- __label__40
Not all that common.  __label__2
Do you live in Plano?  __label__37
twenty years as a mechanic   __label__1
{C but } [ then you, + then you ] give up the money.  __label__39
That's just a matter of defining priorities, I guess -- __label__40
What do you mean?  __label__19
That's true.   __label__7
{E I mean, } it's just the amount that you're overspending,   __label__40
{C so } if it does it's not going to kill us.  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
# By then, # - __label__40
{F Oh, } you mentioned C N N, of course I mentioned radio and the C N N T V news, {D you know? }  __label__38
it's real easy to say that.  __label__40
<Cough>. __label__43
{C So, } on next night, I spread the newspaper in the  bathroom   __label__39
# You mean the crimes # or the punishment should fit the crime?  __label__37
they were bringing up points asking as far as whether they need to give, {F um, } more money to these people,   __label__39
{C and } I really liked that.  __label__39
[ [ I, + I, ] + I, ] -  __label__0
Ha,   __label__11
What time is it now where you are?  __label__35
{F Oh } yes.  __label__11
-- myself.   __label__1
Uh-huh,   __label__7
yeah,   __label__7
Yeah.  __label__11
# yeah,   __label__31
{D Well, } yeah,   __label__11
# Yeah. #  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
# after # having a one that was historical looking.  __label__1
{C but } I've been unable to do that, because I hurt my foot about five years ago.   __label__39
those kind of brown, {F uh, } [ Ju-, + __label__39
{C and } this guy is indicted on three of them.  __label__39
{E I mean, } it only takes one time  for you to use it and not pay the interest,   __label__39
I'm just one of the two -- __label__39
{C and } it just started soon after I had done that one.  __label__39
{F Oh, } yeah.  __label__11
-- # taxes even though my kids will be out of it, # {D you know. }  __label__1
{C and } she stays home, too, also.  __label__39
Uh-huh.   __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D Well, } just like [ [ s-, + some, ] +  one ] quote  that he had was that he thought the America's emblem was stupid because it was an eagle,  __label__39
There was a time, though, in the, {F uh, } middle part of November that got really cool, really, really -- __label__40
{C So, } {D you know, } you couldn't complain about that.  __label__40
{C and } I don't know.   __label__25
{D So } <laughter>,  __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I think a lot of this is coming out of, -  __label__40
They've had some serious problems in the past couple of years.  __label__40
No,   __label__7
-- just going to correct myself.   __label__1
the-, - __label__0
I think it is Raleigh.  __label__40
Yeah.  __label__11
{C so } I have no problems.    __label__39
Right.  __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
he has a ten dollar bill.  __label__39
If I had -- __label__1
Yeah,   __label__11
Yeah,   __label__12
<Barking> Uh-huh.  __label__11
you or the insurance companies never see any of that money.  __label__39
{D Now, } how old are your girls?  __label__35
I think that was good.  __label__22
Yeah,   __label__11
{E I mean } it's not.  __label__39
I really and truly am.   __label__39
{C and } you almost want to, {D you know, } spend a couple of weeks [ with, + ] in class with your child just to see how it is or something.  __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C so } I can believe it   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__7
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D Well, } [ that's, + ] [ that's + ] pretty interesting.   __label__13
{C And } that is kind of steep,  __label__40
I'm not sure if Texas, -  __label__39
{E I mean, } [ I, + I ] can see that research is needed   __label__40
{C and } everybody's got their sleeping bags,   __label__39
{F uh, } my children and [ I, + {F uh, } I ] started a thing where I read a book with them before they went -- __label__39
they were talking thousands cows  ] in one little tiny area.   __label__1
Yeah.   __label__7
<Throat_clearing>. __label__43
{D You know, } I'm tired of fighting it.  __label__5
It seems like she hasn't talked to anybody from Dallas.   __label__39
{C or } something would go wrong   __label__39
{C and, } __label__39
{C But, } {F uh, } I, -  __label__0
Exactly.  __label__7
Either way, - __label__2
I don't know what it was,   __label__39
# {C So } what # about that as an invasion of privacy?  __label__33
{F Uh, } I guess, let me think of another important  thing to look at when you look into college, {F um, }  __label__4
{F Uh, } one of it's great slogans  is if you're not serving the customer, you better be serving someone who is.  __label__40
-- they probably would be married and having their children <laughter>.   __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
it made a big difference.   __label__39
{C and, }  they have their own special bin that they hand it out to everybody   __label__39
I'm from Pennsylvania.  __label__39
I don't know,   __label__30
{C so } I enjoy reading parts on travel in the various -- __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
I like to read  ((   )) , -  __label__39
# I know # my mother and her sister were both married by the time they were twenty --  __label__39
{C But, } {F uh, }  for the older, {F uh, } ranch homes it's pretty typical I guess.  __label__39
[ [ That's + {F um, } <throat_clearing> I, ] + {F uh, }  [ I'm,  + I'm ] ] not that great a cook   __label__39
I think golf, isn't it?  __label__37
<<Asks someone in the background>> What's the name of that restaurant?   __label__42
that's right,   __label__13
Yeah.  __label__11
Yeltsin's in tight with the old guard.   __label__40
it's not a high-rise.   __label__39
uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and } they don't quote you the  proverb out of it,   __label__39
{C so } that's kind of, - __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C So } [ [ I am pretty, + I am [ pretty   (( ob-, )) + pretty ] ]  cons-,  +  {E I mean, } I am pretty aware ] of what goes on -- __label__39
{C And, } {F uh, } -  __label__0
-- of restaurants up there -- __label__1
Yeah.  __label__11
{E I mean } it's just, {F uh, }  as long as you want to, [ and + ] just, {D you know, } a reasonable lengthy conversation.   __label__39
{F Oh } yeah   __label__11
{C and, } - __label__0
I don't care <laughter>.  __label__39
They're going to say to the kids -- __label__40
{F Uh, }  [ I, + {D you know, } I ] think to a certain degree, the reason that [ it, + it ] doesn't serve as a deterrent, {F uh, } may be because [ y-, + you ] never know if it's going to be [ a-, + applied. ]   Right,   __label__40
Uh-huh.   __label__11
[ I, + I ] have a few, {F uh, } handicapped persons  that I, {D you know, } try to [ do things for, + ] help them do.  __label__39
{F Oh, } yeah.  __label__13
{C so. } - __label__0
[ I, +  I'm ] amazed, [ at, +  at ] that's a lot of them even graduated.  __label__39
-- you know.   __label__1
I bet you could too, __label__40
{C But } then you need to make it sure that the rich people can't buy somebody off [ and, + and ] maybe send them in their places or get out of it some other way too.  __label__40
{F Um, } I try to do some painting, although I'm not very good at it <laughter>.  __label__39
{C and, }  # - __label__0
That's a lot.  __label__13
Okay.  __label__11
-- {D you know, } with the various companies --  __label__1
That's right.  __label__7
-- {C and } the car I get to drive is a, {F uh, } Nissan Sentra that's going to be ten years old next month   __label__39
{C and so, } {D you know, } those don't take much time at all.   __label__39
-- are you willing to try new places?   __label__1
[ I, + I ] guess that is supposed to be put out at a time when I was growing up or whatever.   __label__39
{C And so }  (( there's ))  just a whole lot of testing  and a whole lot of pushing to do well on these # tests. #  __label__40
[ [ I, + I, ] + I ] would think, {E I mean, } [ [ a, + a, ] +  a ] base ten system as compared to a base twelve system -- __label__40
We're kind of up [ [ on a, +  on a higher, ] + __label__39
# to, # {F uh, } {F uh, } attain  statehood as it is right now,   __label__1
you have to keep up with them.   __label__40
# Okay,   __label__11
# {F uh, } I think we're getting # to the point now where they're going to eventually let it be, {F um, } majority vote.   __label__40
In fact, I'm a little worried about this one coming up here.   __label__39
it,  -  __label__0
he learns from the older boys too   __label__39
[ I think this is a, + I think this is maybe a ] name brand   __label__39
Metric system, [ no one's very, + {F uh, } no one wants ] it at all seems like.  __label__40
I'm not home then,   __label__39
what they do is they check to see if you've got, {F uh, } current insurance   __label__39
{C but } there's a sense of [ ho-, + ] I guess, purity in the show,   __label__40
{C and } I assume that they would vote differently if they were voting, than your average voter.   __label__40
-- {F uh, } classic rock for me is what I have, which is {D like, } {F uh, } Doors, Eagles, Jimmy Hendrix.  __label__1
{D Well, } I walk two and a half to three miles every night.  __label__39
{C But, } ] {F uh, } {D anyway, } I don't know.   __label__1
Well that's what we're going to end up getting <laughter>.  __label__39
# Right,   __label__7
# and <laughter>,  # __label__1
<Laughter>. __label__43
{D So, } - __label__0
it was channel nine.  __label__39
{C but } I'm sure that there were people that don't.  __label__40
{D You know } they really need surveyors cause [ you could, + you're ] free to travel anywhere.   __label__39
Do  you, - __label__0
{C and, } it's interesting what people get upset about,   __label__39
-- today's ] my first day that I # could # -- __label__1
{C And } I saw Princeton, I think it was, or Harvard play this year.   __label__39
{C And } we don't even know where the twin, -  __label__39
# I could # be around here for hours  [ by + ] myself and never # have it on. #  __label__39
{F Um, } any white fish.   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__7
{C So } she gets destroyed on her bonus check.  __label__39
# {F Huh. } #  __label__0
{C and } she's going to work,   __label__39
-- [ for + <laughter> for ] that election.  __label__1
Right.   __label__26
Yeah,   __label__11
I guess [ our, + we're ] in the process of a home repair right at this point   __label__39
Right.  __label__11
that's good.  __label__13
{C and } I totaled them all up   __label__39
{C so, }  my father was working down in Los Angeles for like, {F uh, } six months or so,   __label__39
{D well } it's funny because [ the one, + the two ] bushes on the ends of the house that I think are ugly, they lived   __label__39
# Be, -  __label__0
you'll be out there waterskiing,   __label__5
{C and, } - __label__0
{F Uh, } {C but } it's, -  __label__0
since I always make chicken burritos and just -- __label__39
[  He, + he ] works on the cars.   __label__39
{C so } I would have to say that camping and  hiking and canoeing and Boy Scouts is my hobby.  __label__39
{C And so } it's almost impossible to, -  __label__39
by the )) campsite, it's so, - __label__0
Uh-huh,   __label__11
they said, - __label__0
it's had the same owner for years.  __label__39
{D well, }  especially when <breathing> anyone who's ever done any kind of drafting or engineering [ w-, +  {F uh, } [ dr-, + drawing, ] ] <breathing> {F um, }  <breathing> -  __label__40
{C And } that was what I was thinking exactly about because in the Soviet Union they had an election,   __label__39
<Throat_clearing>.   *[[slash error]] __label__43
are you going to be a career person?   __label__37
Uh-huh,   __label__11
Yeah,   __label__11
{C But } they do have to visit,  [ and + ] [ if, +  if ]  the parent can point out all the different places to look [ for -- + __label__40
{C But, }  {F uh, } he has enough relatives to make up for me not having any <laughter>.  __label__39
# Yeah. #  __label__11
It had, held {D like } a fifteen shot clip, __label__39
{D Actually, } they've been doing the same thing here.   __label__39
-- {C and } I just didn't want the responsibility.  __label__39
{C but } when I go out somewhere, then, {F uh, } unless I have a pair of dress slacks, I don't usually wear a lot of blue jeans.  __label__39
[ [ I, + I, ] + I ] would guess that that portion of the population is massively under represented.  __label__40
{C And } do [ they, + they ] have a  hotel,   __label__37
-- if anything.  __label__1
in fact all our earlier cars were a standard transmission.   __label__39
{C But } there is a grass that you can use that is  shade tolerant,   __label__39
I, - __label__0
# it # really, {D you know, } ultimately is not penalizing the person that they're trying for get away.  __label__1
The, the, {F uh, } -  __label__0
{F Um, } [ I think i-, + I think ] that it's well   __label__40
{C and } that really surprised me.  __label__39
uh-huh.  __label__7
Yeah.   __label__11
They really grow nice   __label__40
that's not why I go --   __label__39
<Door>. __label__43
{C because } they really have a lot of good [ i-, + insights -- ] __label__40
Yeah.   __label__7
This was like everybody came into town and went to this restaurant.  __label__39
{C And, } {F uh, } cold foo-, {F um, } -  __label__0
and the problem didn't go away,   __label__39
maybe you wouldn't like  Randy Travis.   __label__40
{F Huh. }  __label__11
[ {C and, } + {C and } ]  I've seen people really fight it that desperately needed -- __label__39
Okay,   __label__11
the last one we saw was THELMA AND LOUISE.  __label__39
{C but } when it comes to, {F uh, } small corporations they seem to pocket it a little bit [ quick, + quickly, ] or whatever, or however you want to say it   __label__40
{C so, } - __label__0
Okay,   __label__18
They're going  to have it at Fort Davis --  __label__39
That's not right.  __label__10
{C and  then } in parenthesis it said four hundred fifty-four point six grams <laughter>.  __label__39
<Throat_clearing> <<faint>>. __label__43
sometimes I think a religion has a lot to do with that.   __label__40
{C and } he's got the coordination, that God given coordination,   __label__39
[ it, + it ] takes awhile [ to, + to ] get used to something,   __label__40
it is a deterrent [ in the, + in the ] sense that that person will never do it again <laughter>.  __label__40
I was [ over, + over ] four years doing language surveying which is the first step.   __label__39
{F Uh, } {D you know, } [ I, +  I ] had a friend who was [ a, +  {F uh, } <lipsmack> <sniffing> a ]  policeman [ in  a, + in a ] local borough just a small, {F uh, } [ one of the  little neighborhoods, +  {D you know, } one of the small towns, ] {F uh } -- __label__39
{F Uh, } I went to the Naval Academy.  __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
<Laughter>  {F Oh, } great.  __label__13
Yeah.  __label__11
{C but } they  really are nifty, {F uh, }   __label__40
I think a lot of people are panicked,  how kids are turning out and how things are going for kids and realizing they've got to start  doing something.   __label__40
{C And, }  {F um, } <lipsmack> for a while I had [ a, + {F um, } <lipsmack> {F uh, } a ] partnership [ with a, + in an ] advertising agency with another woman who is [ a, + an ] artist.    __label__39
that was her next question, was, how do you grow paper?  __label__39
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] the one D J said, who the heck is Bonnie Rait and why does she deserve five Grammies?  __label__39
{C And } I think one thing about pets is they're a lot of company.  __label__39
# Put the # colors away <laughter>.  __label__16
Right,   __label__11
<thumping>. __label__43
I don't know,   __label__25
I think that's good.  __label__13
{C But } it's just as, -  __label__0
Yeah.  __label__0
That's true,   __label__7
I've heard so many people talk about that area. -  __label__39
[ we do, + we call ]  that doing biscuits,  __label__39
{D Well, } [ I, + {F uh, } two years ago I ]  started having trouble with my knee.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I guess we're recording now.  __label__40
I never  really thought about that much,   __label__39
{C so, } {F uh, }   *[[slash error]] __label__0
That's true.   __label__7
{C And } I think I learned a lot of that in school too.  __label__39
I know,   __label__7
{C and } {F oh, } grand, -  __label__0
{D See, } that's the thing,   __label__40
yeah.  __label__11
{C Because, } __label__0
[ I, +  I ] think you  understand what I'm getting at,  __label__38
{C and } you're out, {D you know. }   __label__5
Yeah,   __label__11
{C But then } again, yeah,   __label__11
{C And } that, __label__0
{F Uh, } when my husband gets home, [ it's usually, + he's ]   home with my daughter alone   __label__39
depending on your technical areas.   __label__40
{C but } I'm sure that some of the patients were, {F uh, } given medication to keep them [ in, + {F uh, } quiet ]   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
<breathing> __label__1
{D You know, } {E I mean, } if I don't hear him playing, {E I mean, } [ I, + I ] get up and come out and look out the window real often, {D you know, }   __label__39
# she's planning ahead, #  __label__39
{C and } then for desert [ I would, + ] I really wanted to make, {F um, } just brownies   __label__39
{C And } sometimes you might have two or three.  __label__39
# [ {C and, } # + {C and }  ] I even did once when I was a child,  __label__39
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F um, } {F uh, } [ various, + ]  {D you know, } [ any, + any ] part of the country you want to hit, they have got it.   __label__39
# the ] boom # to parents and [ the, +   the ] shoelace department was those little Velcro tabs <noise>.  __label__1
{F Oh, } {F oh, } {D well. }  __label__0
-- I'm kind of looking forward to that one.  __label__1
<Laughter> <baby_crying>.  All right.  __label__22
{C But, }  {F uh, } I know [ I, + __label__39
I think they've learned some real good life skills.  {F Uh, } {D you know, } being -- __label__39
{F Oh, } yeah,   __label__7
{C and } his wife's all excited   __label__39
{F Um, } [ it, +  it ] would be nice  to be able to have flexible hours   __label__40
I could stand this all summer.  __label__39
{C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } this is one of the big things with kids.   __label__39
Uh-huh <baby>.  __label__11
[ That, + that ] takes a good bit to make one that's predictable that's still worth watching.  __label__40
Yeah,   __label__11
You got the term.  __label__7
the same I don't know -  __label__0
Ri-, -  __label__0
<Laughter>. __label__43
Yeah,   __label__0
{C and } I like  it.  __label__39
{C but } if the time came, it'd be real nervous.  __label__40
Huh.   __label__11
Oh.  __label__11
{C and } it wouldn't work   __label__39
{C And } the only reason he came here was because the education is so much better for those who will go after it.  __label__39
{D well, } my mom's, {F um, } parents, they're both [ in their, + in their, ] {F uh, } eighties,   __label__39
{C and } you know, what frightens me, is that, you put a half  a million people out in the middle of the desert -- __label__40
{D So, } - __label__0
{C and } I don't know why certain groups are fighting so hard to keep the ten four one.  __label__39
-- half inch of foam or something.  __label__1
if they're forgetting things or whatever, I'd prefer to have them at home or have them in what they call now home care -- __label__39
{E I mean, } [ I, +  I ] think there could be  [ a + ] better system   __label__40
-- <Laughter> {C and so } we thought, {D you know, } [ [ there, + there was, ] + it was ] broken.  __label__39
# Yeah. #  __label__11
# to be # a parent, __label__1
Someone did,  __label__2
yeah.  __label__11
He dug a hole under the fence.  __label__39
{C and, } - __label__0
-- a little behind on that,   __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
[ I, + I ] feel kind of weird about that anyway,   __label__39
I have a credit union.  __label__39
people from California seem to be more health motivated all around.   {E I mean, } as far as the diet, and  everything.  {F Uh, } the diet and, {F uh, } just your health consciousness,   __label__40
Yeah.   __label__11
-- {C and } he ripped them off and stuck them in the  envelopes   __label__39
{C and then } we moved to, {F uh, } <child> {F uh, } the Dallas area --  __label__39
{D Well, } those things must take up a huge  amount of space in landfills.  __label__40
Did you see it?  __label__37
Or what it was.  __label__2
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C And } now that with Gorbachev is introducing more, I guess, [ freedoms + {E or }  expressions of freedom, ] it doesn't look as though, {D you know, } everybody's following the same pattern.  __label__40
# Yeah,   __label__11
you made me do this,   __label__5
uh-huh.  __label__11
[ it, + it's ] a little bit difficult, though.   __label__39
{C but } they don't have any children.  __label__39
Fighting.  __label__2
cars I think are not made, __label__40
That I guess it's the sports version -- __label__39
{F Oh, } I don't know, {F uh, }   __label__25
# it # also it prevents kids from try to go pull the wool over your eyes,  __label__1
{D well, } the thing about them is that they hold so still you don't notice  that they're there   __label__39
Right.  __label__11
{D Well, } that's true    __label__7
{C So, } [ it, + it ] makes you feel like they're, {F uh, } wanting you to take their opinion.  __label__16
[ {C and, } + {C and then } ] you go to Porsche   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__0
{C But, }  {F uh, } {F um, } I finally decided to go check out [ what the, + {F uh, } what the, ] {F uh, } foreign cars were.   __label__39
{C and } he showed me how to  use his guns   __label__39
Yeah,  __label__11
Yeah.   __label__11
Just by watching what I ate.   __label__1
that will tie you down a little bit.  __label__40
Second of all, why the networks think that, {D you know, } we enjoy that kind of stuff.   __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D Well, } do you still do much work on them, then?  __label__37
What [ is, + {F uh, } is ] a marsala wine a sweeter wine?  __label__37
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and } [ I, + {F uh, } I ] kind of get a kick out of they always want the hero,   __label__39
{F uh, } I spoke because women were [ filing, +  flying ] missions [ [ into, +  {D you know, } for whatever reason, into, ] + {F uh, } in ] the Persian Gulf war.  __label__1
# Just started shooting people, # __label__16
# same here. #  __label__39
It's really, really pretty.   __label__40
I know a number of people who are, {F uh, }  surplused   __label__39
I called everyone I knew,   __label__39
{C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } you could do a lot of it yourself still,   __label__39
[ Th-, + you'll ]  have a little time think about that.   __label__40
take off, {D you know, }   __label__1
# {C But } {D you know, } you know what's really  funny?   __label__32
{C and, } {F um, } what was the name of that?   __label__41
# That's great. #  __label__13
{F Um. }  __label__11
{F Oh, } you have got, {F uh, } young children then.  __label__38
It was nice talking to you.  __label__22
It's going to cost them seven point five billion after tax charge in ninety-three, __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I would love to have a computer,   __label__39
Right.  __label__11
{D So, } - __label__0
Depends on what's going on.  __label__16
the yards all fenced in   __label__39
That's mine.  __label__39
Yeah   __label__7
# it's just whenever we're, {F um. } - __label__40
Uh-huh.   __label__22
{C and } I know Manhattan's real expensive   __label__39
okay.  __label__18
Kind of see what happens.  __label__2
It just might be the drive, {D you know } -- __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__31
Paper just seems so innocuous.  __label__40
{C but } there may be other things.   __label__39
{C But } we never received any merchandise either,   __label__39
the   monitoring is not that bad, though   __label__39
The orthopedist called it a, {F uh, }  basketball injury where the ankle just rolls under you, and it snapped.  __label__39
{C And } have a good weekend.  __label__22
{C and then } the next one down is in the Marines,   __label__39
I can go ahead and start,  __label__26
Something inexpensive.  __label__16
right,   __label__7
{D You know. }   __label__1
-- just wish that I could just go without them.  __label__1
Yeah,  __label__11
{C and } it's almost inconceivable now because the Xerox machines [ and, + and  ] everything have become  [ [ such, +  {D you know, }  su-, ] +  such ] [ [ a, + a  par-, ] + a part  ] of the way we live.  __label__40
Okay.  __label__18
Whenever you donate money to someone?  __label__40
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] that it is [ a + <inhaling> a ] [ l-, + loss. ] [ I, + I ] think is that the Federal government will try to establish a mechanism [ [ ju-, + just ] to do + just [ that + ] [ in or-, + in order ] to ] gain the revenue that's being lost.   __label__40
{C But, } {F uh, } back to the issue, [ is, + ] {F uh, } -  __label__39
-- {C and then } ] I'd have a heck of a time explaining what drug is in my system, {D you know } <laughter>.  __label__1
{C so } I try to listen to the radio in the morning [ and, + and ] try to catch one  of the morning talk shows,   __label__39
{F Oh, } yes,   __label__7
{F Uh, } in a larger school  he had to realize that if he was going to screw around it, he could probably slip   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{F Oh, } that sounds lovely.  __label__13
very good.  __label__1
thank you Salina.  __label__24
They, - __label__0
you can unfold them.  __label__39
That's a good choice,   __label__13
{F Uh, } {C and so } he's used to a bigger size --  __label__39
{E I mean, } obviously [ there's <talking> [ [ the, + the, ] + the ] possibility of, {E or, } was ] the possibility of war, {F uh, }   __label__40
# {C And, }  # {F uh, } [ h-, + {F uh, } he ]  works over in Maryland <swallowing>.  __label__39
Yeah,   __label__7
Wow.  __label__13
yeah.  __label__11
# No,   __label__29
we'd like to do a float trip down, {F uh, } {F oh, } like Big Bend area or something like  that.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
<laughter>  [ [ [ I, + {F uh, } I, ] + {E I mean, } ] +   I ] can relate to that because [ I'm, + I'm ] going to college right now,   __label__39
{C and } now [ my, + my ] [ four year old, + four and a half year old ] daughter [ is, + is ] trying to imitate her older sister and wanting to play   __label__39
Clancy.   __label__1
yeah   __label__7
{D Well, } {F uh, } I've had teenagers   __label__39
yeah.  __label__0
he's coming up, will you help me with my homework   __label__39
we enjoy living here.   __label__39
{C But, }  {F uh, } - __label__0
{C But, }  no.   __label__14
{C And so } [ we had, +  they had, ] {F uh, } {D like } a berry assortment.   __label__39
[ the, + {F uh, } I ] just changed my [ oil, + oil ] tonight   __label__39
student there and spent, {F um, }  a semester studying abroad in London.  __label__1
The air bag came out, {D what, } twenty years ago.  __label__39
{F um, } [ I, + I ] just think that has something to do with why Latinos [ or, + ] tend to be, {D you know, } [ the mee-, + the more meek, ] {D you know, }   __label__1
# Yeah. #  __label__7
[ [ I, + I,  ] + {F uh, } I  ] just went out and got a new V C R yesterday # with cash. #  __label__39
That said anything that is a Skutzhund, [ a, + a ] Tervurien and, {F uh, } [ Alsatian + {A that's the other one. } Alsatian, ] any inner breeding of that can be called a German shepherd here.  __label__39
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F um, } it was <laughter> simply a ploy [ to, + to ] get people, {D you know } -- __label__40
however the need for that -- __label__39
[ I th-, + I think ] so,   __label__22
Right.   __label__7
[ {C And } something else that I would, + __label__39
{D you know, } [ you'd have to [ cli-, + ] {D like }  come over, + they'd have to come over ] the fence,   __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
Yeah,   __label__11
Hills, or what?  __label__37
{C but, }  {F uh, } in the long run, it seems to me, it's kind of like what they keep talking about [ the,  + {F uh, } the ]  AIDS testing with doctors or dentists and things -- __label__40
had quite a few quarterbacks if you think about it.  {F Uh, }   __label__1
{C and } she did that all the way around the room which makes it look very attractive,  __label__39
Yeah,   __label__7
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F Oh, } I think so.  __label__7
Huh-uh.  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__31
{C And } I guess, {F uh, } I don't know how old you are.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F Uh, } {C and, } {D you know, } {E I mean, } __label__39
{F Oh, } uh-huh.  __label__11
I could not believe he did that,   __label__39
that's right   __label__7
isn't, -  __label__0
-- yeah   __label__1
-- yeah,   __label__1
{C so } [ it's not, + it's not ]  what you think it is.  __label__40
you have to shut your eyes or  not listen or something, because those drive you crazy, [ if you're, + if you're ] in the room.   __label__40
{C because } it seems {D like }  now, even in the country, you hear about bad things happening.  __label__40
I'm from, {F uh, } northern Utah,   __label__39
-- a lot of people on death row.  __label__1
-- I think our, {F uh, } -  __label__1
# {C And } I've # enjoyed that, watching how well  I can walk up and down stairs.  __label__39
# Uh-huh. #  __label__11
[ She, + {F uh } -- __label__39
{C but, } {F uh, } [ they, + they ] were fun games to watch.  __label__39
Right.  __label__11
-- [ and, + and, ] breaking them up and  sitting out there and eating them, __label__1
one friend of ours got rid of his [ [ because we motivated him + because we, ] {D you know, } cause we ] were getting along out ours   __label__39
{D You know, } you just have to have these things just,  {D you know, } have them at home, have to have them at my own place   __label__40
{F Uh, } {C but } now I find myself using the computer,   __label__39
# whether it's # possible <laughter> to have honesty in government.   __label__1
{C and } it is hard to make, {F uh, } those interests not be as a major part of my life.  __label__39
[ I re-, + I remember. ]  __label__39
Right.  __label__7
<laughter> We don't really [ have, + {F uh, } {D you know, } entertain ] too much.  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{D So. } - __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C And, }  {F uh, } {F uh, } [ the, + the ] waves were huge.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F Uh, } thank God that I had one.   __label__39
I probably won't finish it until the end of the year --  __label__39
I mean a real small town <laughter>.   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
{C And, }  {F uh, } <laughter>. - __label__0
Yeah.  __label__11
because you're endangering everybody's lives [ if you + -- __label__40
[ it was, +  it was ] innovative, {F uh, } a completely new approach to making a movie  in a lot of ways,   __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and } -- __label__0
Even something so simple as getting a street light in between -- __label__39
{F oh } {D well, } I guess it was on the HOME SHOW,   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and } I've, -  __label__0
My husband is doing it too,   __label__39
[ {C but, } + {C but then } ] it's probably that way anywhere, {D you know, }   __label__40
Yep.   __label__31
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__7
{F Oh. }  __label__0
{C And } we had to talk about air pollution too. __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
<<Very faint>> <throat_clearing>. __label__43
{C and } Richardson's supposed to start some pilot schools, going to school year around.  __label__39
{D you know, } __label__39
-- {C and } she has that up in her attic   __label__39
The thing about when it gets hot here is, I don't like the humidity,   __label__39
-- which are sort of not colleges   __label__1
-- {D you know, } [ the, + the ] people that work in big business have families --  __label__1
{C because } that's, -  __label__0
{F Oh } Lord.  __label__13
Thanks.   __label__24
Yeah,   __label__11
{F Um, } {D well, } - __label__0
Yeah,   __label__11
Yeah,   __label__11
We have, {F um, } {D you know } -  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
-- {C but } unfortunately the house is taking up my time.  __label__39
{C So } <laughter>. - __label__0
{C but } when it enters into what they're doing when they're not at work, I find that to be fairly offensive also.  __label__40
[ {C and, } + {C because } ] I don't know of any other countries that are doing this --  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
I agree.   __label__7
{C or } [ what-, + ]  she's losing her sight or whatever.  __label__39
Right.  __label__11
that you can't use personal computers,  so you have to use, {D you know, } a main frame.  __label__1
{C and, }  {F um, }  we're going to have to figure out a new idea.   __label__39
# {D Well, } I don't believe in a single #  government or a single control for the world.  __label__39
to tell you how liberal I have turned, {F uh, } toward this, [ [ or, + or, ] + or ] whatever side that is -- __label__40
All right <laughter>.  __label__11
{C And } June, July, August are,  {D you know, } -  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
I wonder now in, -  __label__0
# Really,   __label__11
{C and } she wasn't going to buy me something I was going to grow out of next week.  __label__39
{C but } it helps people.   __label__39
[ those are, + those are ] not Americans <laughter>   __label__5
All right.  __label__22
Uh-huh.  __label__11
right.   __label__11
That was kind of a funny movie with, {F uh, } Richard Dreyfuss and  Bill Murray.  __label__39
{C And } she just kept saying how wild he was.   __label__39
there are things I should do.   __label__40
-- north of us.   __label__1
-- sometimes,   __label__1
{D You know, } the instructor told us certain things about {D well, } don't follow what's really necessarily on the box, {D you know, } if you're making just a cake from a box, {D you know, } do this cause, {D you know, } make it a variety.  __label__39
As in, {F uh, } martini.  __label__39
{D Well, } {C but, } the, -  __label__0
yeah,   __label__7
{C But } [ I like, + I like ] mysteries.  __label__39
{F Uh, } I don't know what y'all are paying in Dallas,   __label__32
Wha-, - __label__0
{C But } I [ had, + {F uh, } had ] a Ford Escort that absolutely needed  (( taps ))  the day we got it.  __label__39
part of these costs like the people on Death Row -- __label__1
She's a year and a half old now,   __label__39
{C But, } yet the, - __label__0
{C and } [ they, + they ] just been real, {F uh, } <breathing> -  __label__39
{D So, } yeah   __label__11
we're in our thirties.  __label__39
Sometimes I just -  __label__0
right.  __label__11
{C and } also, {F uh, } I meant to be trying to pick up on MURPHY BROWN, __label__39
there's a lot that's happened in my lifetime as far as, {F uh, } {D you know, } with the space shuttle and all.   Although plans to, {F uh, } go to other planets have somewhat been thwarted in comparison to, {F uh, } the sixties.  __label__39
people as -  __label__0
Suspicious.  __label__2
All my aunts and uncles.   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__7
[ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C so, } ] [ it's, +  it might not be ] too bad if you want to go skiing somewhere else.   __label__40
{C But } mostly they're from the area.  __label__39
I like the [ more, + ] movies that make you think.  __label__39
{C So, }  you were out there in San Francisco?  __label__16
<Sniffing> {F Uh, } [ so-, + the, ]  {F uh, } -  __label__0
-- real well.   __label__1
my house kind of looks like two trailers put together.  __label__39
I can imagine, {D you know, }  the longer and longer it goes, - __label__40
[ that's what I, + that's basically what ] I, and, when I first, -  __label__39
# {C and } what, # - __label__0
{C and, } {D you know, } other then that I'm sure they watched, - __label__39
Yeah.  __label__31
see in a lot of the windows?  __label__39
[ [ I, + they ] didn't, + they did not ] define it,   __label__39
right.  __label__3
-- she needed somebody to watch her twenty-four hours a day.  __label__39
they are, -  __label__7
{F Uh, } {D well, } yeah,   __label__31
{C and so } [ they're getting, + they get ] the socialization with other kids, [ and, + {D you know, } and ] not really school, [ but, + but ] a different authority than mom, once in a while, {D you know, } kind of learning how to deal with society.  __label__39
Yes.  __label__11
what kind of things do you like to do in your spare time?  __label__35
{F Oh, } no,   __label__10
{E I mean } obviously you can look at it and say {D well, } {D anyway. } -  __label__40
# {C And } they're # going to be really struggling   __label__40
That # sounds like fun. #  __label__13
{C but. }  If you're like me, you never have enough time for the hobbies.  __label__38
{F Oh, } okay.  __label__11
{C And, }  {F uh, } while parents very  often will be involved with the school activities when the child's in the elementary school   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Really?  __label__17
I wonder, {F uh, } {F uh, } - __label__0
{C and } I will probably be going back to work around January, __label__39
You t-, - __label__0
Uh-huh.   __label__11
[ I don't, + I don't ] think they should be forced,   __label__40
# {C But, }  {F uh, } # - __label__0
# What?  <laughter> #  __label__17
# where I was working, # - __label__1
(( Amen )) .  __label__13
{C But, }  {F uh. } - __label__0
I let two of them out just in the back yard every now and then,   __label__39
If I like it I am going to wear it.  __label__39
# <Throat_clearing>  Uh-huh.  #  __label__11
what I have been reading.   __label__1
in other words, if they just wanted to have [ a, + a ] gun to have in their home, {F uh, } [ you wouldn't, + you wouldn't ] like them to be able to do that?   __label__37
I assume so.  __label__38
Oh,  __label__11
{C but } just when I got out I feel like I should have spent more time in the library,   __label__39
right.   __label__7
-- so # he can eat. #  __label__1
Uh-huh,   __label__11
{F Uh, } I work for a little start-up company here in Pittsburgh called Trans Ark.  # {F Uh, } #  __label__39
[ {C So, } + {C but, } ] {D you know, } [ it's not, + it's never ] quite, - __label__0
or like I sat in on the meetings or something.  __label__1
{F Uh, } I think they're interesting.  __label__39
[ I'm, + I'm ] not sur-, -  __label__0
{C and } I aged ten years.  __label__39
no   __label__10
Uh-huh.  __label__11
-- working out of their own home.  __label__1
They've gotten their butts kicked,  __label__40
{C But, } at least once you pay your way in there, __label__39
{C and } <laughter> [ I'll say, +  they'll say, ] {F oh, } {D well, } [ our kids, +  my kid, ]   __label__40
maybe I can learn something.  __label__40
I think [ no-, + now, ]  you go to work when they're six weeks old, __label__40
Oh.   __label__0
Yeah,   __label__11
# Uh-huh. #  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and, } {F uh, } [ i-, + ]  it's nice,   __label__39
Right.  __label__11
Yeah.   __label__7
# {C But, } I # have a problem.   __label__39
{C and } if not, the infant is going to lay in the crib all day, and maybe have a mobile above it to play with.  __label__40
{C And } that's basically where I ended up.   __label__39
{C and then } they had, {F um, } {D you know, } -  __label__39
Personally, I have a Japanese car right now,   __label__39
They kind of say, {D well } what do you want me to believe.  __label__40
uh-huh.  __label__7
{C and } it  [ seems, + seems ]  as though [ the, + the ] system doesn't [ cha-, + ]  tend to stop them unless something is drastic is done.  __label__40
{F Uh, } I wouldn't swear to it myself.  __label__25
# I do too,   __label__7
Yeah.  __label__11
I tell you I haven't read a book in a long time.   __label__39
{D You know, } {C but } that's at least the good thing about the Texas organization letting you buy the tickets cheaper.  __label__39
it wasn't a mystery,   __label__39
<Laughter> So many of my crafts, -  __label__39
{F Um, } there's also [ [ a, +  a ] +  a ]  producer of movies in Baltimore called, {F um, } John Walters, [ who, +  who ] [ puts, +  puts ]  on even weirder movies.   __label__39
<Breathing> Yes,   __label__31
-- I think that's probably one of the biggest -- __label__1
# I don't, you know.#  __label__25
# yeah,   __label__12
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] he was [ rather +  {D well, } {D you know, } rather ] well to do in the old regime   __label__39
-- [ only use + ] {D like } one person does the work   __label__1
[ that, + that  ] sounds like a hell of an idea.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and  so } they just notify everyone by mail,   __label__39
Uh-huh,   __label__11
I really didn't get to use them like, {F oh, } there's mosquitoes  let's turn them.   __label__39
{C and } the children are left without either parent.   __label__39
{D Well, } I quit ten years ago   __label__39
I use to play soccer a lot in high school,   __label__39
[ {C and, } +  {C and } ] it was one of those ones that could have been four hours if they hadn't cut a lot out.  __label__39
I never got past that stage.  __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
{C And } a [ lot of it, + lot of it ]  has to do with, {F uh, } salaries too, # speaking # -- __label__40
routing hardwood will, {F uh, } take the edge off a cheap  bit pretty fast <sniffing>.   __label__1
That's the girls I lived with   __label__39
Oh.  __label__11
{C and, } __label__14
Let's see if I can remember it,   __label__4
[ {D So, } +  {D so } ] you would favor a law which said there could not be lobbyists.   __label__16
Oh.   __label__11
Yeah,   __label__11
I can believe.  __label__13
videos, that had something to do with the war.  __label__1
for a hobby or for, - __label__37
{C although } in my case I might have been more, {F uh, } sympathetic with the person who got caught,   __label__40
I mean, we have walked out of more dealerships saying, don't bring us the manager, and  all of that unless you want to bring him right away.   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__7
{C and } they start asking  questions and in the sense are [ [ invite-, + invade, ] + invading ]  your privacy although, if you know what the social norms are, {D you know, } quote unquote,  you asked for it.   __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__31
Yeah,   __label__11
{C But } just on the limited basis that I do it, I do enjoy it very much.  __label__26
Yeah  __label__11
{C But } I'm going to try it.   __label__39
{C And } [ I will never, + I never  ] buy anything from a telephone, __label__39
{C or, } - __label__0
<Laughter>. __label__43
They're kind of big and hefty tennis shoes.  __label__39
{C because } I was thinking, -  __label__39
{D well, }  <throat_clearing> they do quite well for themselves # <laughter>. #  __label__40
All righty.   __label__22
Yes.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{F Uh, } I determine first of all what I'm going to use the vehicle for, whether it's going to be primarily as a family mover or as [ a, +  a ] personal mover.  {F Uh, } where it's going to be driven, {D you know, } what types of, {F uh, } driving I'm going to be doing on it, primarily highway [ or, +  or ] local mileage more often.   __label__39
-- {C so, } you can bring them,   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__31
# {C So, } [ I've just been doing it, + I try to do it ] every night -- __label__39
not a huge part  {C but }  a,  {D you know } -- - __label__40
okay,   __label__18
[ I, + I ] don't understand it,   __label__39
yes.  #  __label__11
{C so. } - __label__0
The old one you had to go pick a line,  use little arrows to go onto the screen and check where you wanted to start, and where, __label__39
you can't till it,   __label__40
{D Well, } that is great.  __label__13
Ouch <laughter>.  __label__13
{C and } that can basically [ be, +  be ] put [ on any lot, +   in any state, ] [ any kin-, + ] {D you know, }   __label__39
I have two kids over there.  __label__39
Yeah <<faint>>.  __label__11
No,   __label__29
have you?  __label__37
That wasn't alive for but maybe two years.  __label__39
The best of, __label__40
{C So } [ it, + it's ] basically a  bunch of small towns anyway.   __label__39
yeah.  __label__11
a lot of women are being hired now instead of men because they can get brought in at lower salaries because that's what everybody else assumes they are going to get.  __label__40
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] that it's fascinating [ to, + to ] think a lot of someone  who doesn't know how to say private.  __label__40
{C and } you can push a button   __label__39
today.   *[[slash error]] __label__0
{C But } that's  because of my physical condition and nothing to do what they did.  __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
What, -  __label__0
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C And, }  {F uh, } [ it, + it's ] pretty much headline news.  __label__39
it's at her house,   __label__39
<Sniffing>. __label__43
Yeah,   __label__7
Yeah,   __label__11
{C so } I changed that.  __label__39
{D you know, } a [ large, + large ] percent   __label__1
Yeah,   __label__11
[ It's, + it's ] to bad because  it's, {F uh, } {E I mean, } [ th-, + ] just even the random occurrences where, {D you know, }  it's unsafe for a woman just to walk from the car to the, some, in certain areas like [ from the car, + from their car ] to the mall or something -  __label__40
# {F Oh, } okay.  #  __label__18
[ say that, + __label__39
{C but } it's not off the list.  __label__40
Is that, -  __label__37
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Right.  __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
{F Uh, } she's, - __label__0
They're grown and gone.  __label__39
Real good idea.  __label__13
# Yeah.  #  __label__11
{D So, } {D well, } I don't know   __label__25
Yeah,   __label__7
I've tried to, I spent like eight hours planting this nice garden out there --  __label__39
Yeah,   __label__7
{C And } they were  simple too,   __label__40
I like those <laughter>.  __label__39
Yes.   __label__31
{C And } we went to the, - __label__39
# even.   __label__1
{F oh, } of course.  __label__39
[ I've got, + I inherited ] [ some, + some ] stuff like fifteen thirty seconds.  __label__39
I don't particularly care for that sort of stuff.  __label__39
# {C So, } # {D you know } <laughter>.  I guess, {F uh, } some of the foods that we really enjoy though are the, {F um, } {F um, } {D like } Chinese,  __label__39
[ it's + there's ] not a choice, [ # it's # -- + __label__40
[ {C and, } + {D you know, } {C but } ] my husband is from New Jersey   __label__39
<Laughter> Fried chicken.  __label__12
{C and } [ that, + that  ] concerns me greatly.  __label__39
{C and } he was the one that delivered it.   __label__39
{F Uh, } I think they're asking for it.   __label__40
That is really interesting.   __label__40
{C and, } {F uh, } the kids go down [ the hi-, + the hill  ] on the sleds when it's icy,   __label__39
It's just like # bye,   __label__39
yeah. #   __label__0
No,   __label__29
do you know John Qumenato?  __label__37
Yeah,   __label__7
My, {F um, } <lipsmack> parents have one   __label__39
not around here.  __label__39
some people did, {F uh, } on that last cruise that we took because they was having a storm come in --  __label__39
{C And, } {F uh, } unfortunately, that's not what I thinks happened <laughter>.   *[[listen]] __label__40
{D Well, } my office mate here, Earl, [ he, + he  ] goes to all the Maverick games   __label__39
{C and } [ with, + {F uh } -- __label__40
{C but } telephone calls I figure, they don't bother me one way or the other.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and } -- __label__37
{C but } I enjoyed it.   __label__39
{C but } we planted corn last year too, which takes quite a bit of space --  __label__39
{F Oh, } absolutely.  __label__7
We would make that sacrifice.   __label__39
{F Oh, } yeah.  __label__11
No <laughter>.  __label__29
Really?  __label__17
uh-huh.  __label__11
{C but, } __label__39
yeah,   __label__31
{F Oh, } really.  __label__11
{D Well } at least it's fruit and stuff there <laughter>.  __label__39
A girlfriend of mine found a, -  __label__39
{C and } somebody's come up with a new one that, {F uh, } sort of, -  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C but } [ it, + it's ] a very good company.  # That # -- __label__39
{C and, }  {F uh, } - __label__0
Yeah.  __label__11
{F Uh, } yeah,   __label__7
{C But } you're married?  __label__38
Pardon me?  __label__19
{C but } I don't know how families  afford two new car payments.   __label__39
-- that are [ pretty, +  {D you know, }  very ] protective, {D you know } <laughter>.  __label__1
yeah.   __label__31
Uh-huh.  __label__1
{F Um, } hobbies,   __label__0
{F Oh, } okay.  __label__18
[ they, + they ] drove up,   __label__39
engineering and # computers. # - __label__1
{C and } it was really kind of interesting <<pause>>.   __label__39
[ it was {D like, } +  it was {D like } ]  {D you know } Israel controls our government.  __label__39
the company I work for furnishes,   __label__39
{F um, } [ {C but }   its', +  {C but } it's ] an experience I wouldn't change,   __label__39
Just cut their heads off and skin them   __label__39
-- least not  ] in this country anyway.  __label__1
<Laughter>  Are you into serving wines with your dinner party?  __label__37
I think they test four or five a day, actually exploding the air bags --  __label__39
{F Oh, } yeah,   __label__31
But, {F uh, } that they, {F uh, }  are much more contentious.   __label__1
{C And } {D you know, } __label__39
Right.  __label__11
I think it's, {F uh, } probably listed in the restaurants, {D you know. }  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__29
he said what did you get a deal for, Bill.   __label__39
I don't think that's right.   __label__39
-- {D you know, } from one system to the other -- __label__1
{C and } the youngest is  twenty-eight,  __label__39
{C And } really at our point of life  our children are grown   __label__39
Down by Big Bend?  __label__3
where  does Detroit fit in?  __label__35
{E I mean, } they just couldn't believe this   __label__39
{F Um, } {C and } the quarter of a million dollar home or whatever.  __label__40
Right.  __label__11
Okay.  __label__18
Oh.   __label__11
that was very good.   __label__40
{F Oh, } where you from Tina?  __label__35
The guy said it'd been on the lot about thirty minutes.   __label__39
{F Uh, } no.   __label__29
I moved down here from Chicago, what, twenty-three years ago -- __label__39
Yes.  __label__11
{D Like } [ I, + I ] would really like to be a teacher,  __label__39
and  then above that we left it white   __label__39
{D You know, }  {C so } it isn't any extended, {F uh, }   __label__39
{C but, }  {F uh, } it's been [ recommend-, + {E or } suggested ] that we cut a few of the trees down here,   __label__39
-- # five # years.  __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yeah, [ or, + or ] <throat_clearing> try to make a living.  __label__7
{D You know } more about this stuff than I do, obviously then, - __label__40
{C and } we've had a few of the health fairs up here   __label__39
Yeah.  __label__11
I don't like metric system.  __label__39
Oh.   __label__11
{D Well, } {D you know, } you can take some of [ that, + that ] testing a little bit too far.   __label__40
{C and } I think, maybe, as you get outside the Dallas area,   __label__39
[ this is, + this is ] [ a, + a ] man's trip <laughter>.  __label__39
Mom would say you planted them in the wrong sign of the moon. __label__39
[ he, + we ] have all our piles [ of, + of ] recyclables also.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
# it # would be three years,   __label__39
{C But } if it was informal, my first choice would be crawfish.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C but } you -- __label__14
Are your rooms in your house bigger since it's a sixties home?   __label__37
Yeah,   __label__11
[ I, + I  ] don't, -  __label__0
right,   __label__11
And discipline.   __label__40
{C and, } {F um, } [ they're past this, + they've been ] latchkey children for a while,   __label__39
{C So } I had a poli-, -  __label__0
{D like } about the middle of the semester I ended up having  to have surgery on my foot,  __label__39
<Laughter>. __label__43
{C and } yeah,   __label__0
You, # - __label__0
# {C And, so, } I think # that kind of control [ is, +  would be ] good,  __label__40
everybody likes that.  __label__40
-- I'd probably have nightmares for the next six months # <laughter>.   __label__1
{C and, } __label__39
Okay,   __label__7
{F Oh, } okay.   __label__11
How many -- __label__35
{C And } these people,  <inhaling> {D you know, } [ in the, + in the ] course of the trial, {D you know, }  came up [ with, + with ] all these, {D you know, }  things about {D well, } {D you know, }  they were disadvantaged and all this stuff.   __label__39
{C and, } - __label__0
# out # there in West Texas.  __label__1
There have been a couple of times when  [ [ the, + the,  ] +  {F uh, } whatever the ] subject was, I guess caught my interest and I went along with it   __label__39
{C and } they said <breathing> it's like  getting a Ph D  almost,   __label__39
[ [ I, + {F uh, } I, ] + I ] guess you work for T I.  __label__38
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and } they'll say, -  __label__0
That's on {D like } Route two eighty-seven  or something like that.  __label__39
I'll be right back.  __label__20
that's probably true.   __label__7
{C and } for one, -  __label__0
# Yeah,   __label__11
That is a riot.  __label__39
<Laughter>  Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C or, } - __label__0
# Uh-huh. #  __label__11
[ [ we don't, + we, ] + we weren't ] sure how to do that   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__11
We're getting company tonight,  __label__39
{C and } I appreciate your having called.  __label__22
[ I, + I ] think you're exactly right because, {D you know, } I've gone  ou-, -  __label__40
Yeah.  __label__11
{C So } whenever I think of family reunions, -  __label__0
{D Well, } [ I, + I ] don't know if that would really work that way or not.   __label__40
{C and, } {F uh, } I really don't know the answer, <laughter>,   __label__39
How do you feel about it?  __label__33
Uh-huh.  __label__11
-- {F uh, } you name it,   __label__8
wonderful.  __label__1
I've, I've worked in a couple of local campaigns.   __label__39
{C So, } I haven't talked to them this weekend,   __label__39
{D Well, } {D you know } the funny thing I find about American opinion is that when we have gone in to destabilize a government before, the American public goes crazy.  __label__40
Yeah.  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__7
-- selfish and shortsighted.   __label__1
Yes.  __label__11
<Laughter>. __label__43
You're not a T I, -  __label__39
{D You know, } I don't know your feelings toward that.   __label__36
-- in some sort of savings account.  __label__1
maybe one of these days, I'll, -  __label__39
it was his responsibility   __label__39
I -  __label__1
Do you have a particular composer that you like or, __label__37
That's interesting.  __label__40
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Could be.   __label__9
Right.   __label__11
{C and } [ it looked, + it resembled ] a Mazaratti <<name of car>> -- __label__39
{C But, } -  __label__0
I'll take one of the kids with me grocery shopping, {F um, } usually on the weekend,   __label__39
[ I, +  I ] seem to remember that, {F uh, } little byline <noise>  on a lot of things I've read.  __label__40
{C And } I don't even know what they're doing for themselves. __label__40
Right.  __label__11
{F Um, } {C but } I've noticed that  what I do is that I have my towel that sits on the floor,  so that every time I get up to  bowl, I have to bend over to pick up my towel   __label__39
{C And } [ it, + it ] just, -  __label__0
Yeah,   __label__11
[ it's, + it's ] hard <child>.  __label__39
{C and, } {F uh, } kids eat funny.  __label__40
right.   __label__7
{C but, } __label__40
{C So } [ that was, + {F uh, } that was ] very disheartening.  __label__39
{E I mean } jeez, they are one and four <laughter>.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C And, } {F uh, } I know that [ it, + it ] must be really challenging to, {F uh, } try to juggle a job [ and, + and ] also your children.   __label__40
Okay.   __label__18
[ It's, + it's ] gets cold at night,  and then warm in the afternoons.  __label__28
{F Uh, } yeah,   *[[slash error should be 'b']] __label__1
{F Oh, } boy that is wonderful.  __label__13
{F Huh. }  __label__0
-- {C and } [ we've, + we have ] been to Whistler in Canada,  which is just a marvelous place,   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__31
{E I mean, }  I can remember instances that, {F uh, } wasn't as, {F uh, } {D you know, } bad,   __label__39
We have gone more into the business aspect [ of, + like I say, of,  ] I don't know, working more,   __label__40
{C or } are you talking about # others? #  __label__34
{C and } the part that I did was more fun [ than, +  {F uh, } than ]  labor because they did [ the, +  the ] running and toting chores and I just helped cook  and kind of organize, {D you know. }  __label__39
{C but } then we'd [ roast, + roast ] marshmallows,   __label__39
Yeah,   __label__7
{F Uh, } course, they find that the  choice creates its own hardships in a way because life is not quite as simple even if  it is for your, {D you know, }   __label__40
{C so } I ended up taking on  the load of making sure everybody knows what they're doing   __label__39
{C and } your wife's folks still live in Colorado?  __label__38
# {C So, } {F uh }  # -- __label__39
<laughter>. __label__43
Right.  __label__11
You can meet some really neat people.  __label__40
{C Because } I know I stayed home with mine and didn't start working until mine were in high school.  __label__39
I do some --  __label__39
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C but } ] they're, -  __label__0
{C So. } - __label__0
yes,   __label__7
-- {D you know } -- - __label__1
{C but } here in Dallas [ it's, + ]  I think they all were planted by the classical Johnny Appleseed,  and Johnny Pecanseed, whatever you would call it, {D you know, }   __label__40
It's like # ROCKY films.   __label__40
a lot of people changed around there   __label__39
{E I mean, }   by the time you get off work, go by and  pick up the, {F uh, } baby from the baby sitter, it's, {D you know, }  after six   __label__39
[ I, + I ] love that kind of cooking.   __label__39
When I was single we used to always cook, around the house.  __label__39
on to it,   __label__1
{C and } [ it, +  it ] burned up one time   __label__39
# {D Now } the # only problem [ is, +  is ] the aftermath, __label__40
then [ you can find out from, + {D you know, } you can find somebody ] else that can tell you something else about these,  __label__1
{D see, } that's one thing I like about [ the, + {F uh, } some ] of the folk music scenes, {D you know, }   __label__39
-- once upon a time.   __label__1
I'm trying to study for that now.  __label__39
Yeah.   __label__7
I have {D like } a Diner's Club [ through my, {F um, } + where I ] work --  __label__39
Yes.  __label__11
Right,   __label__7
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C but } I find it to be very -  __label__39
{C and } those cases are, {F uh, } lesser degrees of magnitude.   {D You know, }   __label__40
{D Well, } I'm a housewife,   __label__39
Little, -  __label__0
{F Uh, } {C but } I think in general <squeak>  it's probably good.   __label__40
{C but } I felt kind of stupid <laughter>.  __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
friends at work <laughter>  __label__1
# Uh-huh. #  __label__11
# Bye-bye. #  __label__22
What kind of business is it?  __label__35
{F Oh, } yeah.   __label__7
{C and } they react to what they see at home.  {D You know. }  __label__40
Back when they were in Saint Louis?  __label__37
# Yeah,   __label__7
of course, get a guy like Cecil Fielder, {D you know, }   __label__39
You know, but, uh,   __label__0
Those are pretty.  __label__13
{C and } # they like  to go through   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__11
Yeah.  __label__11
{C and } I like to read,   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__7
They gave them food and uniforms   __label__39
What about you <laughter>?  __label__33
[ {C and, } +  {C and } ] since we have decided to put everybody in jail that commits a crime now, [ that + ] that's complicated the entire process.  __label__40
That, {D you know, } - __label__0
No,   __label__7
-- in there --  __label__1
{F Oh, } {D well } I will.  {D You know, }   __label__7
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{C and } he was good at distance, Spitz, as a swimmer, {D you know, }   __label__40
I think <laughter>  that's true.  #  __label__7
I've had a regiment now for about,  {D you know, } ten, fifteen years [ of, + of ] doing that   __label__39
{C But, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } when [ I, +  you ] find somebody just like that situation, {E I mean, } it was disgusting when I read about it today.   __label__40
Right.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
-- and things like that,   __label__1
-- if you're going to have the structure and you're going to have the large numbers, you're going to need really, - __label__1
{C but } it wasn't that bad,   __label__39
What is it that, -  __label__0
{C And } [ it took me, + {E I mean } it took ] such courage #  you wouldn't <laughter> believe # -- __label__39
# {C And then, } # __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
{E I mean } it just # -- __label__39
{D Well, } [ [ then, + then there's almost, ] + then there's almost ] [ no, + no, ] {F uh, } {F uh, } choice left to her then <noise>.  __label__40
{D Well, } [ I ha-, + I  know ] that, for instance, in the N C double A, they drug test   __label__39
I don't know.   __label__30
{C and }  they were set up with two + buffets, one for their regular Sunday chicken and roast beef and  vegetables and everything. __label__39
for example there's a hung jury here in Fort Worth, today, in eight to four   __label__39
If the-, - __label__0
Right,   __label__11
# That's true.  #  __label__7
# that # come   __label__1
{F uh, } {C and } if you recall how it goes downtown, __label__39
<Laughter> We go from regular kind of spring clothes -- __label__39
I, __label__7
# (( )). # __label__43
{C And, } {F uh, } <noise> <<water sound>> {E pardon me, } I'm just sort of putting away some things from dinner now -- __label__39
# Surely. #  __label__7
Uh-huh,   __label__11
{C So } I just thought, -  __label__39
I don't know,   __label__25
Were they {D like } all in Dallas?  __label__37
-- {D definitely, } I'm sure, the winters are more mild here.  __label__1
-- {C but } sometimes, -  __label__0
{C But } to me # it, # - __label__39
{F Um, } {F um, } {D well, } [ n-, + __label__27
<laughter>. __label__43
{D Like, } [ I, + I ] get night courses that [ they + they'll ] cover right now   __label__39
Uh-huh.    __label__11
<Noise>. __label__43
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Yeah,   __label__11
sorry,   __label__21
{C And } [ that, + {E I mean } that's ] never happened before,  __label__39
{C and } I must say it was interesting.  __label__40
# Where # -- __label__35
{D you know, } {D well, } I believe in this or I believe in that,  __label__1
[ that's, + that's ] what I see burning a lot.   __label__39
[ He said that out here, + he said that when he comes back ] he knows that it, it's [ ju-, + completely ] changed his life.  __label__39
it's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting.   __label__39
now.   __label__1
-- {C but } do you ] think Gates should resign?  __label__1
{F uh, } they are tempting at times,  __label__40
yeah,   __label__11
Maybe political a-, - __label__40
{C and } to get into the system's very difficult.   __label__39
Uh-huh.  __label__11
Uh-huh.  __label__11
It's the oldest town in Texas.  __label__39
Right.  __label__11
I think if you're going into {D like, }  {F uh, } law or  medicine, a very particular, very specific field, [ even, + even ]  engineering, [ you can get, + you can meet ] a lot of the requirements at a public, {F um, } institution.  __label__39
# <laughter>. # __label__43
I'd like to be able [ to, +  to ]  evaluate your boss   __label__39
[ We have, + we have ] most of our soft drinks are in plastic liter or two liter bottles.  __label__39
{C and } {D you know, } [ I, + I ] think there's, -  __label__0
{C or, } - __label__0
-- things like that.  __label__1
-- <Laughter> use them.  __label__1
# Box seats #  run from, {F oh, } like eight dollars to twelve dollars.  __label__39
if they don't get paid   __label__1
[ [ He's, + he, ] + we ] bought the cat for him   __label__39
I guess talking on the phone is one of my hobbies too.  __label__39
for a mother to have to go back to work at six weeks.  __label__1
Service is more of a problem.  __label__40
I don't think it was really corruption that caused it,   __label__40
I'll be darned.  __label__13
{C But, } {F uh } <TV>, - __label__0
{C But } I've been wanting to see TURTLE TWO.   __label__39
that's right.  __label__13
{C but }  [ he held off, +  {F uh, } {D you know, } just he and a handful of guys  managed to hold off ] the whole Union navy for a while from coming up the Sabine River which was of no consequence but still is an interesting story.  __label__40
Is that, what was yours more like?  __label__35
{F Oh, } is that right.  __label__17
Sea shells.  __label__2
(( Hit ))  the bags.  __label__11
{D Well, } Rowlett had [ sent, + sent ] out a survey, not too long ago, {F um, } in terms in how many people were interested in having [ a, + a ] pick up, I guess, on the days they do trash or something like that.   __label__39
he works in the construction.   __label__39
{C so, } - __label__0
unless they get used to something, they're really  nervous   __label__40
{C And } that's fun.   __label__40
-- {C and } [ I, + I've ] noticed more and more I would say over the last six months --   *[[slash error--one utt with b.26]] __label__39
{C and } [ three + [ bu-, + bu-, ] {D you know, } four ] bucks now to get in.   __label__39
{C so, } __label__37
Yeah,   __label__7
((   ))  tell me about it,   __label__13
{F Oh, } yeah.  __label__18
I've had to get it from Oklahoma.   __label__39
something's excellent about them, whether it's the way they were written or  whether it was the material [ they were written, + {D you know, } that was written ] about.   __label__40
It was fun.  __label__16
Off and on,   __label__1
Uh-huh.  __label__11
<breathing>  <<Exhales deeply while saying the first I guess so>> <breathing>  I guess so <<pause>>.   __label__40
versus what are, - __label__1
Uh-huh,   __label__18
{C And, }  [ was, + I was ] the first one, of anyone  [ that, + that ] anyone had ever known, <laughter> to have a divorce.  __label__39
[ I'm scared, + I would be scared ] to death my child might accidentally get out,   __label__39
he [ was, +  used ] to be a reporter for, {F uh, } I think, the NEW YORK TIMES,  or the WASHINGTON POST, one of the two,   __label__39
Huh.  __label__11
{C And so } now we have all  these nations that owe us all this money   __label__39
{D anyway, } what would you watch, if you had, {D you know, } this week to watch?  __label__1
{C And } [ you can't, +  you just can't ]   do it and get away with it, {D you know, } hoping that {D you know, } - __label__39
{C and } I know historically a lot  of companies I think carried dental as a rider along with the medical --  __label__39
It wasn't,  __label__0
I'm sorry.  __label__21
Yes.  __label__31
{C and } the Parole Board received approximately a thousand letters  protesting putting this person back on the street within eighteen months after killing someone.   __label__39
what, + that's exactly what's ] happening in my family.  __label__1
{D Well, } I almost felt like it was too much.   __label__39
{F Uh, } I'm trying to just think of the ones that have come on.   __label__39
-- {C and } I said, {D well, } I guess that's true.   __label__39
I like that real well. __label__39
Uh-huh.   __label__11
Yes, {F uh, }   __label__31
Uh-huh,   __label__11
What?   __label__19
Probably blowing up there to you guys <laughter>.  __label__40
{D like }  from now on all licenses would have that, __label__40
There's probably five or six, which would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs, that are in positions over some of these Soviet states.   __label__39
[ she's, +  she's ] one of mine,   __label__5
Uh-huh.  __label__11
In fact in, I think if people would learn to turn off the T V -s   __label__40
They're ahead,   __label__39
[ I wonder, + I wonder ] if now the people in the Soviet Union don't have ideas very different from that.  __label__38
It's, definitely true.   __label__40
I guess, my feeling is the way to do it [ is, + is ] to just start giving weights, {D you know, } have a very brief transition period and then just start giving weights and  kilometers, {F er, } just as in kilometers and weights and kilograms and everything like that and, {F uh, } just have people start using it rather than having people constantly trying to convert.   __label__40
I don't know,   __label__30
{C And } they kind of got [ it, +  us ] involved that way.  __label__39
